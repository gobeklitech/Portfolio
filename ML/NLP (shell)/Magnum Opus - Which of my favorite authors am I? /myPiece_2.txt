The Mother of my home town is a mountain


Her name is Temelpa, and some say she is magical


She protects her people, even showing them the path


She exists at a nexus of Earth, a convergence of plates, of Ideology 
 
She distills wisdom they bring to her, spawning novelty around


In her shadow exists the San Francisco Bay and its mind children 


On her slopes formed bands like The Grateful Dead, movements like the Beat


But people don’t know about her Center


Deep inside her limestone shelfs lies an ancient secret


A technology beyond our wildest dreams 


A relic from another Time, another sequence of possibilities


Maybe she is drawing people towards It, like Gravity 


Its energy forms a creative cradle, an ideological incubator for all to enjoy


Use it wisely, she whispers through the trees 


Pay attention, she rumbles through the Earth


Play nice, she whistles through the heavens 


Come home, she beckons to me
