The history of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is now so complicated that every time I tell it I contradict myself, and whenever I do get it right I'm misquoted. So the publication of this omnibus edition seemed like a good opportunity to set the record straight or at least firmly crooked. Anything that is put down wrong here is, as far as I'm concerned, wrong for good. 
The idea for the title first cropped up while I was lying drunk in a field in Innsbruck, Austria, in 1971. Not particularly drunk, just the sort of drunk you get when you have a couple of stiff GÃ¶ssers after not having eaten for two days straight, on account of being a penniless hitchhiker. We are talking of a mild inability to stand up. 
I was traveling with a copy of the Hitch Hiker s Guide to Europe by Ken Walsh, a very battered copy that I had borrowed from someone. In fact, since this was 1971 and I still have the book, it must count as stolen by now. I didn't have a copy of Europe on Five Dollars a Day (as it then was) because I wasn't in that financial league. 
Night was beginning to fall on my field as it spun lazily underneath me. I was wondering where I could go that was cheaper than Innsbruck, revolved less and didn't do the sort of things to me that Innsbruck had done to me that afternoon. What had happened was this. I had been walking through the town trying to find a particular address, and being thoroughly lost I stopped to ask for directions from a man in the street. I knew this mightn't be easy because I don't speak German, but I was still surprised to discover just how much difficulty I was having communicating with this particular man. Gradually the truth dawned on me as we struggled in vain to understand each other that of all the people in Innsbruck I could have stopped to ask, the one I had picked did not speak English, did not speak French and was also deaf and dumb. With a series of sincerely apologetic hand movements, I disentangled myself, and a few 
minutes later, on another street, I stopped and asked another man who also turned out to be deaf and dumb, which was when I bought the beers. 
I ventured back onto the street. I tried again. 
When the third man I spoke to turned out to be deaf and dumb and also blind I began to feel a terrible weight settling on my shoulders; wherever I looked the trees and buildings took on dark and menacing aspects. I pulled my coat tightly around me and hurried lurching down the street, whipped by a sudden gusting wind. I bumped into someone and stammered an apology, but he was deaf and dumb and unable to understand me. The sky loured. The pavement seemed to tip and spin. If I hadn't happened then to duck down a side street and pass a hotel where a convention for the deaf was being held, there is every chance that my mind would have cracked completely and I would have spent the rest of my life writing the sort of books for which Kafka became famous and dribbling. 
As it is I went to lie in a field, along with my Hitch Hiker's Guide to Europe, and when the stars came out it occurred to me that if only someone would write a Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy as well, then I for one would be off like a shot. Having had this thought I promptly fell asleep and forgot about it for six years. 
I went to Cambridge University. I took a number of bathsand a degree in English. I worried a lot about girls and what had happened to my bike. Later I became a writer and worked on a lot of things that were almost incredibly successful but in fact just failed to see the light of day. Other writers will know what I mean. 
My pet project was to write something that would combine comedy and science fiction, and it was this obsession that drove me into deep debt and despair. No one was interested, except finally one man a BBC radio producer named Simon Brett who had had the same idea, comedy and science fiction. Although Simon only produced the first episode before leaving the BBC to concentrate on his own writing (he is best known in the United Stares for his excellent Charles Paris detective novels), I owe him an immense debt of gratitude for simply getting the thing to happen in the first place. He was succeeded by the legendary Geoffrey Perkins. 
In its original form the show was going to be rather different. I was feeling a little disgruntled with the world at the time and had put 
together about six different plots, each of which ended with the destruction of the world in a different way, and for a different reason. It was to be called "The Ends of the Earth " 
While I was filling in the details of the first plot in which the Earth was demolished to make way for a new hyperspace express route I realized that I needed to have someone from another planet around to tell the reader what was going on, to give the story the context it needed. So I had to work out who he was and what he was doing on the Earth. 
I decided to call him Ford Prefect. (This was a joke that missed American audiences entirely, of course, since they had never heard of the rather oddly named little car, and many thought it was a typing error for Perfect.) I explained in the text that the minimal research my alien character had done before arriving on this planet had led him to think that this name would be "nicely inconspicuous." He had simply mistaken the dominant life form. 
So how would such a mistake arise? I remembered when I used to hitchhike through Europe and would often find that the information or advice that came my way was out of date or misleading in some way. Most of it, of course, just came from stories of other people's travel experiences. 
At that point the title The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy suddenly popped back into my mind from wherever it had been hiding all this time. Ford, I decided, would be a researcher who collected data for the Guide. As soon as I started to develop this particular notion, it moved inexorably to the center of the story, and the rest, as the creator of the original Ford Prefect would say, is bunk. 
The story grew in the most convoluted way, as many people will be surprised to learn. Writing episodically meant that when I finished one episode I had no idea about what the next one would contain. When, in the twists and turns of the plot, some event suddenly seemed to illuminate things that had gone before, I was as surprised as anyone else. 
I think that the BBC's attitude toward the show while it was in production was very similar to that which Macbeth had toward murdering people initial doubts, followed by cautious enthusiasm and then greater and greater alarm at the sheer scale of the undertaking and still no end in sight. Reports that Geoffrey and I and 
the sound engineers were buried in a subterranean studio for weeks on end, taking as long to produce a single sound effect as other people took to produce an entire series (and stealing everybody else's studio time in which to do so), were all vigorously denied but absolutely true. 
The budget of the series escalated to the point that it could have practically paid for a few seconds of Dallas. If the show hadn't worked... 
The first episode went out on BBC Radio 4 at 10 30 P.M. on Wednesday, March 8, 1978, in a huge blaze of no publicity at all. Bats heard it. The odd dog barked. 
After a couple of weeks a letter or two trickled in. So someone out there had listened. People I Balked to seemed to like Marvin the Paranoid Android, whom I had written in as a one scene joke and had only developed further at Geoffrey's insistence. 
Then some publishers became interested, and I was commissioned by Pan Books in England to write up the series in book form. After a lot of procrastination and hiding and inventing excuses and having baths, I managed to get about two-thirds of it done. At this point they said, very pleasantly and politely, that I had already passed ten deadlines, so would I please just finish the page I was on and let them have the damn thing. 
Meanwhile, I was busy trying to write another series and was also writing and script editing the TV series "Dr. Who," because while it was all very pleasant to have your own radio series, especially one that somebody had written in to say they had heard, it didn't exactly buy you lunch. 
So that was more or less the situation when the book The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was published in England in September 1979 and appeared on the Sunday Times mass market best-seller list at number one and just stayed there. Clearly, somebody had been listening. 
This is where things start getting complicated, and this is what I was asked, in writing this Introduction, to explain. The Guide has appeared in so many forms books, radio, a television series, records and soon to be a major motion picture each time with a different story line that even its most acute followers have become baffled at times. 
Here then is a breakdown of the different versions not including the various stage versions, which haven't been seen in the States and only complicate the matter further. 
The radio series began in England in March 1978. The first series consisted of six programs, or "fits" as they were called. Fits 1 thru 6. Easy. Later that year, one more episode was recorded and broadcast, commonly known as the Christmas episode. It contained no reference of any kind to Christmas. It was called the Christmas episode because it was first broadcast on December 24, which is not Christmas Day. After this, things began to get increasingly complicated. 
In the fall of 1979, the first Hitchhiker book was published in England, called The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It was a substantially expanded version of the first four episodes of the radio series, in which some of the characters behaved in entirely different ways and others behaved in exactly the same ways but for entirely different reasons, which amounts to the same thing but saves rewriting the dialogue. 
At roughly the same time a double record album was released, which was, by contrast, a slightly contracted version of the first four episodes of the radio series. These were not the recordings that were originally broadcast but wholly new recordings of substantially the same scripts. This was done because we had used music off gramophone records as incidental music for the series, which is fine on radio, but makes commercial release impossible. 
In January 1980, five new episodes of "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" were broadcast on BBC Radio, all in one week, bringing the total number to twelve episodes. 
In the fall of 1980, the second Hitchhiker book was published in England, around the same time that Harmony Books published the first book in the United States. It was a very substantially reworked, reedited and contracted version of episodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, S and 6 (in that order) of the radio series "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy." In case that seemed too straightforward, the book was called The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, because it included the material from radio episodes of "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," which was set in a restaurant called Milliways, otherwise known as the Restaurant at the End of the Universe. 
At roughly the same time, a second record album was made featuring a heavily rewritten and expanded version of episodes 5 and 6 of the radio series. This record album was also called The Restaurant at the End of the Universe. 
Meanwhile, a series of six television episodes of "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" was made by the BBC and broadcast in January 1981. This was based, more or less, on the first six episodes of the radio series. In other words, it incorporated most of the book The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and the second half of the book The Restaurant at be End of the Universe. Therefore, though it followed the basic structure of the radio series, it incorporated revisions from the books, which didn't. 
In January 1982 Harmony Books published The Restaurant at the End of the Universe in the United States. 
In the summer of 1982, a third Hitchhiker book was published simultaneously in England and the United States, called Life, the Universe and Everything. This was not based on anything that had already been heard or seen on radio or television. In fact it flatly contradicted episodes 7, 8, 9, 10, I 1 and 12 of the radio series. These episodes of "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," you will remember, had already been incorporated in revised form in the book called The Restaurant at the End of the Universe. 
At this point I went to America to write a film screenplay which was completely inconsistent with most of what has gone on so far, and since that film was then delayed in the making (a rumor currently has it that filming will start shortly before the Last Trump), I wrote aâ¨fourth and last book in the trilogy, So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish. This was published in Britain and the USA in the fall of 1984 and it effectively contradicted everything to date, up to and including itself. 
As if this all were not enough I wrote a computer game for Infocom called The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which bore only fleeting resemblances to anything that had previously gone under that title, and in collaboration with Geoffrey Perkins assembled The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy: The Original Radio Scripts (published in England and the USA in 1985). Now this was an interesting venture. The book is, as the title suggests, a collection of all the radio scripts, as broadcast, and it is therefore the only example of one Hitchhiker publication accurately and consistently reflecting another. I feel a 
little uncomfortable with this which is why the introduction to that book was written after the final and definitive one you are now reading and, of course, flatly contradicts it. 
People often ask me how they can leave the planet, so I have prepared some brief notes. 
How to Leave the Planet 
I. Phone NASA. Their phone number is (713) 483-3111. Explain that it's very important that you get away as soon as possible. 
2. If they do not cooperate, phone any friend you may have in the White House-(202) 456-1414-to have a word on your behalf with the guys at NASA. 
3. If you don't have any friends in the White House, phone the Kremlin (ask the overseas operator for 0107-095-295-9051). They don't have any friends there either (at least, none to speak of), but they do seem to have a little influence, so you may as well try. 
4. If that also fails, phone the Pope for guidance. His telephone number is 011-39-6-6982, and I gather his switchboard is infallible. 
5. If all these attempts fail, flag down a passing flying saucer and explain that de's vitally important you get away before your phone bill arrives.

THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY 
For Jonny Brock and Clare Gorst and all other Arlingtoniansâ¨for tea, sympathy, and a sofa 
Preface 
Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun. 
Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea. 
This planet has or rather had a problem, which was this: mostâ¨of the people on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy. 
And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and most of them were miserable, even the ones with digital watches. 
Many were increasingly of the opinion that they'd all made a big mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place. And some said that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no one should ever have left the oceans. 
And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to people for a change, one girl sitting on her own in a small cafe in Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that had been going wrong all this time, and she finally knew how the world could be made a good and happy place. This time it was right, it would work, and no one would have to get nailed to anything. 
Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone to tell anyone about it, a terribly stupid catastrophe occurred, and the idea was lost forever. 
This is not her story. 
But it is the story of that terrible stupid catastrophe and some of its consequences. 
It is also the story of a book, a book called The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy not an Earth book, never published on Earth, and until the terrible catastrophe occurred, never seen or heard of by any Earthman. 
Nevertheless, a wholly remarkable book. 
In fact it was probably the most remarkable book ever to come out of the great publishing houses of Ursa Minor of which no Earthman had ever heard either. 
Not only is it a wholly remarkable book, it is also a highly successful one more popular than the Celestial Home Care Omnibus, better selling than Fifty More Things to do in Zero Gravity, and more controversial than Oolon Colluphid's trilogy of philosophical blockbusters Where God Went Wrong, Some More of God's Greatest Mistakes and Who is this God Person Anyway? 
In many of the more relaxed civilizations on the Outer Eastern Rim of the Galaxy, the Hitch Hiker's Guide has already supplanted the great Encyclopedia Galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom, for though it has many omissions and contains much that is apocryphal, or at least wildly inaccurate, it scores over the older, more pedestrian work in two important respects. 
First, it is slightly cheaper; and secondly it has the words DON'T PANIC inscribed in large friendly letters on its cover. 
But the story of this terrible, stupid Thursday, the story of its extraordinary consequences, and the story of how these consequences are inextricably intertwined with this remarkable book begins very simply. 
It begins with a house. 
Chapter 1 
The house stood on a slight rise just on the edge of the village. It stood on its own and looked over a broad spread of West Country farmland. Not a remarkable house by any means it was about thirty years old, squattish, squarish, made of brick, and had four windows set in the front of a size and proportion which more or less exactly failed to please the eye. 
The only person for whom the house was in any way special was Arthur Dent, and that was only because it happened to be the one he lived in. He had lived in it for about three years, ever since he had moved out of London because it made him nervous and irritable. He was about thirty as well, dark haired and never quite at ease with himself. The thing that used to worry him most was the fact that people always used to ask him what he was looking so worried about. He worked in local radio which he always used to tell his friends was a lot more interesting than they probably thought. It was, too most of his friends worked in advertising. 
It hadn't properly registered with Arthur that the council wanted to knock down his house and build an bypass instead. 
At eight o'clock on Thursday morning Arthur didn't feel very good. He woke up blearily, got up, wandered blearily round his room, opened a window, saw a bulldozer, found his slippers, and stomped off to the bathroom to wash. 
Toothpaste on the brush so. Scrub. 
Shaving mirror pointing at the ceiling. He adjusted it. For a moment it reflected a second bulldozer through the bathroom window. Properly adjusted, it reflected Arthur Dent's bristles. He shaved them off, washed, dried, and stomped off to the kitchen to find something pleasant to put in his mouth. 
Kettle, plug, fridge, milk, coffee. Yawn. 
The word bulldozer wandered through his mind for a moment in search of something to connect with. 
The bulldozer outside the kitchen window was quite a big one. 
He stared at it. 
"Yellow," he thought and stomped off back to his bedroom to get dressed. 
Passing the bathroom he stopped to drink a large glass of water, and another. He began to suspect that he was hung over. Why was he hung over? Had he been drinking the night before? He supposed that he must have been. He caught a glint in the shaving mirror. "Yellow," he thought and stomped on to the bedroom. 
He stood and thought. The pub, he thought. Oh dear, the pub. He vaguely remembered being angry, angry about something that seemed important. He'd been telling people about it, telling people about it at great length, he rather suspected: his clearest visual recollection was of glazed looks on other people's faces. Something about a new bypass he had just found out about. It had been in the pipeline for months only no one seemed to have known about it. Ridiculous. He took a swig of water. It would sort itself out, he'd decided, no one wanted a bypass, the council didn't have a leg to stand on. It would sort itself out. 
God what a terrible hangover it had earned him though. He looked at himself in the wardrobe mirror. He stuck out his tongue. "Yellow," he thought. The word yellow wandered through his mind in search of something to connect with. 
Fifteen seconds later he was out of the house and lying in front of a big yellow bulldozer that was advancing up his garden path. 
Mr. L Prosser was, as they say, only human. In other words he was a carbon-based life form descended from an ape. More specifically he was forty, fat and shabby and worked for the local council. Curiously enough, though he didn't know it, he was also a direct male-line descendant of Genghis Khan, though intervening generations and racial mixing had so juggled his genes that he had no discernible Mongoloid characteristics, and the only vestiges left in Mr. L Prosser of his mighty ancestry were a pronounced stoutness about the tum and a predilection for little fur hats. 
He was by no means a great warrior: in fact he was a nervous worried man. Today he was particularly nervous and worried because 
something had gone seriously wrong with his job which was to see that Arthur Dent's house got cleared out of the way before the day was out. 
"Come off it, Mr. Dent,", he said, "you can't win you know. You can't lie in front of the bulldozer indefinitely." He tried to make his eyes blaze fiercely but they just wouldn't do it. 
Arthur lay in the mud and squelched at him. 
"I'm game," he said, "we'll see who rusts first." 
"I'm afraid you're going to have to accept it," said Mr. Prosser gripping his fur hat and rolling it round the top of his head, "this bypass has got to be built and it's going to be built!" 
"First I've heard of it," said Arthur, "why's it going to be built?" 
Mr. Prosser shook his finger at him for a bit, then stopped and put it away again. 
"What do you mean, why's it got to be built?" he said. "It's a bypass. You've got to build bypasses." 
Bypasses are devices which allow some people to drive from point A to point B very fast whilst other people dash from point B to point A very fast. People living at point C, being a point directly in between, are often given to wonder what's so great about point A that so many people of point B are so keen to get there, and what's so great about point B that so many people of point A are so keen to get there. They often wish that people would just once and for all work out where the hell they wanted to be. 
Mr. Prosser wanted to be at point D. Point D wasn't anywhere in particular, it was just any convenient point a very long way from points A, B and C. He would have a nice little cottage at point D, with axes over the door, and spend a pleasant amount of time at point E, which would be the nearest pub to point D. His wife of course wanted climbing roses, but he wanted axes. He didn't know why he just liked axes. He flushed hotly under the derisive grins of the bulldozer drivers. 
He shifted his weight from foot to foot, but it was equally uncomfortable on each. Obviously somebody had been appallingly incompetent and he hoped to God it wasn't him. 
Mr. Prosser said: "You were quite entitled to make any suggestions or protests at the appropriate time you know." 
"Appropriate time?" hooted Arthur. "Appropriate time? The first I knew about it was when a workman arrived at my home yesterday. I asked him if he'd come to clean the windows and he said no he'd come to demolish the house. He didn't tell me straight away of course. Oh no. First he wiped a couple of windows and charged me a fiver. Then he told me." 
"But Mr. Dent, the plans have been available in the local planning office for the last nine month." 
"Oh yes, well as soon as I heard I went straight round to see them, yesterday afternoon. You hadn't exactly gone out of your way to call attention to them had you? I mean like actually telling anybody or anything." 
"But the plans were on display..." 
"On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them." 
"That's the display department."â¨"With a torch."â¨"Ah, well the lights had probably gone."â¨"So had the stairs."â¨"But look, you found the notice didn't you?" 
"Yes," said Arthur, "yes I did. It was on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying Beware of the Leopard." 
A cloud passed overhead. It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent as he lay propped up on his elbow in the cold mud. It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent's house. Mr. Prosser frowned at it. 
"It's not as if it's a particularly nice house," he said. "I'm sorry, but I happen to like it."â¨"You'll like the bypass." 
"Oh shut up," said Arthur Dent. "Shut up and go away, and take your bloody bypass with you. You haven't got a leg to stand on and you know it." 
Mr. Prosser's mouth opened and closed a couple of times while his mind was for a moment filled with inexplicable but terribly attractive visions of Arthur Dent's house being consumed with fire and Arthur himself running screaming from the blazing ruin with at least three 
hefty spears protruding from his back. Mr. Prosser was often bothered with visions like these and they made him feel very nervous. He stuttered for a moment and then pulled himself together. 
"Mr. Dent," he said. 
"Hello? Yes?" said Arthur. 
"Some factual information for you. Have you any idea how much damage that bulldozer would suffer if I just let it roll straight over you?" 
"How much?" said Arthur. 
"None at all," said Mr. Prosser, and stormed nervously off wondering why his brain was filled with a thousand hairy horsemen all shouting at him. 
By a curious coincidence, None at all is exactly how much suspicion the ape-descendant Arthur Dent had that one of his closest friends was not descended from an ape, but was in fact from a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and not from Guildford as he usually claimed. 
Arthur Dent had never, ever suspected this. 
This friend of his had first arrived on the planet some fifteen Earth years previously, and he had worked hard to blend himself into Earth society with, it must be said, some success. For instance he had spent those fifteen years pretending to be an out of work actor, which was plausible enough. 
He had made one careless blunder though, because he had skimped a bit on his preparatory research. The information he had gathered had led him to choose the name "Ford Prefect" as being nicely inconspicuous. 
He was not conspicuously tall, his features were striking but not conspicuously handsome. His hair was wiry and gingerish and brushed backwards from the temples. His skin seemed to be pulled backwards from the nose. There was something very slightly odd about him, but it was difficult to say what it was. Perhaps it was that his eyes didn't blink often enough and when you talked to him for any length of time your eyes began involuntarily to water on his behalf. Perhaps it was that he smiled slightly too broadly and gave people the unnerving impression that he was about to go for their neck. 
He struck most of the friends he had made on Earth as an eccentric, but a harmless one an unruly boozer with some oddish habits. For instance he would often gatecrash university parties, get badly drunk and start making fun of any astrophysicist he could find till he got thrown out. 
Sometimes he would get seized with oddly distracted moods and stare into the sky as if hypnotized until someone asked him what he was doing. Then he would start guiltily for a moment, relax and grin. 
"Oh, just looking for flying saucers," he would joke and everyone would laugh and ask him what sort of flying saucers he was looking for. 
"Green ones!" he would reply with a wicked grin, laugh wildly for a moment and then suddenly lunge for the nearest bar and buy an enormous round of drinks. 
Evenings like this usually ended badly. Ford would get out of his skull on whisky, huddle into a corner with some girl and explain to her in slurred phrases that honestly the colour of the flying saucers didn't matter that much really. 
Thereafter, staggering semi-paralytic down the night streets he would often ask passing policemen if they knew the way to Betelgeuse. The policemen would usually say something like, "Don't you think it's about time you went off home sir?" 
"I'm trying to baby, I'm trying to," is what Ford invariably replied on these occasions. 
In fact what he was really looking out for when he stared distractedly into the night sky was any kind of flying saucer at all. The reason he said green was that green was the traditional space livery of the Betelgeuse trading scouts. 
Ford Prefect was desperate that any flying saucer at all would arrive soon because fifteen years was a long time to get stranded anywhere, particularly somewhere as mindboggingly dull as the Earth. 
Ford wished that a flying saucer would arrive soon because he knew how to flag flying saucers down and get lifts from them. He knew how to see the Marvels of the Universe for less than thirty Altairan dollars a day. 
In fact, Ford Prefect was a roving researcher for that wholly remarkable book The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. 
Human beings are great adaptors, and by lunchtime life in the environs of Arthur's house had settled into a steady routine. It was Arthur's accepted role to lie squelching in the mud making occasional demands to see his lawyer, his mother or a good book; it was Mr. Prosser's accepted role to tackle Arthur with the occasional new ploy such as the For the Public Good talk, the March of Progress talk, the They Knocked My House Down Once You Know, Never Looked Back talk and various other cajoleries and threats; and it was the bulldozer drivers' accepted role to sit around drinking coffee and experimenting with union regulations to see how they could turn the situation to their financial advantage. 
The Earth moved slowly in its diurnal course. 
The sun was beginning to dry out the mud Arthur lay in. 
A shadow moved across him again. 
"Hello Arthur," said the shadow. 
Arthur looked up and squinting into the sun was startled to see Ford Prefect standing above him. 
"Ford! Hello, how are you?" 
"Fine," said Ford, "look, are you busy?" 
"Am I busy?" exclaimed Arthur. "Well, I've just got all these bulldozers and things to lie in front of because they'll knock my house down if I don't, but other than that... well, no not especially, why?" 
They don't have sarcasm on Betelgeuse, and Ford Prefect often failed to notice it unless he was concentrating. He said, "Good, is there anywhere we can talk?" 
"What?" said Arthur Dent. 
For a few seconds Ford seemed to ignore him, and stared fixedly into the sky like a rabbit trying to get run over by a car. Then suddenly he squatted down beside Arthur. 
"We've got to talk," he said urgently. 
"Fine," said Arthur, "talk." 
"And drink," said Ford. "It's vitally important that we talk and drink. Now. We'll go to the pub in the village." 
He looked into the sky again, nervous, expectant. 
"Look, don't you understand?" shouted Arthur. He pointed at Prosser. "That man wants to knock my house down!" 
Ford glanced at him, puzzled.â¨"Well he can do it while you're away can't he?" he asked. "But I don't want him to!"â¨"Ah."â¨"Look, what's the matter with you Ford?" said Arthur. 
"Nothing. Nothing's the matter. Listen to me I've got to tell you the most important thing you've ever heard. I've got to tell you now, and I've got to tell you in the saloon bar of the Horse and Groom." 
"But why?" 
"Because you are going to need a very stiff drink." 
Ford stared at Arthur, and Arthur was astonished to find that his will was beginning to weaken. He didn't realize that this was because of an old drinking game that Ford learned to play in the hyperspace ports that served the madranite mining belts in the star system of Orion Beta. 
The game was not unlike the Earth game called Indian Wrestling, and was played like this: 
Two contestants would sit either side of a table, with a glass in front of each of them. 
Between them would be placed a bottle of Janx Spirit (as immortalized in that ancient Orion mining song "Oh don't give me none more of that Old Janx Spirit/ No, don't you give me none more of that Old Janx Spirit/ For my head will fly, my tongue will lie, my eyes will fry and I may die/ Won't you pour me one more of that sinful Old Janx Spirit"). 
Each of the two contestants would then concentrate their will on the bottle and attempt to tip it and pour spirit into the glass of his opponent who would then have to drink it. 
The bottle would then be refilled. The game would be played again. And again. 
Once you started to lose you would probably keep losing, because one of the effects of Janx spirit is to depress telepsychic power. 
As soon as a predetermined quantity had been consumed, the final loser would have to perform a forfeit, which was usually obscenely biological. 
Ford Prefect usually played to lose. 
Ford stared at Arthur, who began to think that perhaps he did want to go to the Horse and Groom after all. 
"But what about my house...?" he asked plaintively. 
Ford looked across to Mr. Prosser, and suddenly a wicked thought struck him. 
"He wants to knock your house down?" 
"Yes, he wants to build..." 
"And he can't because you're lying in front of the bulldozers?" 
"Yes, and..." 
"I'm sure we can come to some arrangement," said Ford. "Excuse me!" he shouted. 
Mr. Prosser (who was arguing with a spokesman for the bulldozer drivers about whether or not Arthur Dent constituted a mental health hazard, and how much they should get paid if he did) looked around. He was surprised and slightly alarmed to find that Arthur had company. 
"Yes? Hello?" he called. "Has Mr. Dent come to his senses yet?" 
"Can we for the moment," called Ford, "assume that he hasn't?" 
"Well?" sighed Mr. Prosser. 
"And can we also assume," said Ford, "that he's going to be staying here all day?" 
"So?" 
"So all your men are going to be standing around all day doing nothing?" 
"Could be, could be..." 
"Well, if you're resigned to doing that anyway, you don't actually need him to lie here all the time do you?" 
"What?"â¨"You don't," said Ford patiently, "actually need him here." 
Mr. Prosser thought about this. 
"Well no, not as such...", he said, "not exactly need..." Prosser was worried. He thought that one of them wasn't making a lot of sense. 
Ford said, "So if you would just like to take it as read that he's actually here, then he and I could slip off down to the pub for half an hour. How does that sound?" 
Mr. Prosser thought it sounded perfectly potty. 
"That sounds perfectly reasonable," he said in a reassuring tone of voice, wondering who he was trying to reassure. 
"And if you want to pop off for a quick one yourself later on," said Ford, "we can always cover up for you in return." 
"Thank you very much," said Mr. Prosser who no longer knew how to play this at all, "thank you very much, yes, that's very kind..." He frowned, then smiled, then tried to do both at once, failed, grasped hold of his fur hat and rolled it fitfully round the top of his head. He could only assume that he had just won. 
"So," continued Ford Prefect, "if you would just like to come over here and lie down..." 
"What?" said Mr. Prosser. 
"Ah, I'm sorry," said Ford, "perhaps I hadn't made myself fully clear. Somebody's got to lie in front of the bulldozers haven't they? Or there won't be anything to stop them driving into Mr. Dent's house will there?" 
"What?" said Mr. Prosser again. 
"It's very simple," said Ford, "my client, Mr. Dent, says that he will stop lying here in the mud on the sole condition that you come and take over from him." 
"What are you talking about?" said Arthur, but Ford nudged him with his shoe to be quiet. 
"You want me," said Mr. Prosser, spelling out this new thought to himself, "to come and lie there..." 
"Yes."â¨"In front of the bulldozer?" "Yes."â¨"Instead of Mr. Dent." "Yes." 
"In the mud." 
"In, as you say it, the mud." 
As soon as Mr. Prosser realized that he was substantially the loser after all, it was as if a weight lifted itself off his shoulders: this was more like the world as he knew it. He sighed. 
"In return for which you will take Mr. Dent with you down to the pub?" 
"That's it," said Ford. "That's it exactly."â¨Mr. Prosser took a few nervous steps forward and stopped. "Promise?"â¨"Promise," said Ford. He turned to Arthur.â¨"Come on," he said to him, "get up and let the man lie down." Arthur stood up, feeling as if he was in a dream. 
Ford beckoned to Prosser who sadly, awkwardly, sat down in the mud. He felt that his whole life was some kind of dream and he sometimes wondered whose it was and whether they were enjoying it. The mud folded itself round his bottom and his arms and oozed into his shoes. 
Ford looked at him severely. 
"And no sneaky knocking down Mr. Dent's house whilst he's away, alright?" he said. 
"The mere thought," growled Mr. Prosser, "hadn't even begun to speculate," he continued, settling himself back, "about the merest possibility of crossing my mind." 
He saw the bulldozer driver's union representative approaching and let his head sink back and closed his eyes. He was trying to marshal his arguments for proving that he did not now constitute a mental health hazard himself. He was far from certain about this his mind seemed to be full of noise, horses, smoke, and the stench of blood. This always happened when he felt miserable and put upon, and he had never been able to explain it to himself. In a high dimension of which we know nothing the mighty Khan bellowed with rage, but Mr. Prosser only trembled slightly and whimpered. He began to fell little pricks of water behind the eyelids. Bureaucratic cock-ups, angry men lying in the mud, indecipherable strangers handing out inexplicable humiliations and an unidentified army of horsemen laughing at him in his head what a day. 
What a day. Ford Prefect knew that it didn't matter a pair ofâ¨dingo's kidneys whether Arthur's house got knocked down or not now. 
Arthur remained very worried.â¨"But can we trust him?" he said.â¨"Myself I'd trust him to the end of the Earth," said Ford.â¨"Oh yes," said Arthur, "and how far's that?"â¨"About twelve minutes away," said Ford, "come on, I need a drink." 
Chapter 2 
Here's what the Encyclopedia Galactica has to say about alcohol. It says that alcohol is a colourless volatile liquid formed by the fermentation of sugars and also notes its intoxicating effect on certain carbon-based life forms. 
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy also mentions alcohol. It says that the best drink in existence is the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster. 
It says that the effect of a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster is like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick. 
The Guide also tells you on which planets the best Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters are mixed, how much you can expect to pay for one and what voluntary organizations exist to help you rehabilitate afterwards. 
The Guide even tells you how you can mix one yourself. 
Take the juice from one bottle of that Ol' Janx Spirit, it says. 
Pour into it one measure of water from the seas of Santraginus V Oh that Santraginean sea water, it says. Oh those Santraginean fish!!! 
Allow three cubes of Arcturan Mega-gin to melt into the mixture (it must be properly iced or the benzine is lost). 
Allow four litres of Fallian marsh gas to bubble through it, in memory of all those happy Hikers who have died of pleasure in the Marshes of Fallia. 
Over the back of a silver spoon float a measure of Qualactin Hypermint extract, redolent of all the heady odours of the dark Qualactin Zones, subtle sweet and mystic. 
Drop in the tooth of an Algolian Suntiger. Watch it dissolve, spreading the fires of the Algolian Suns deep into the heart of the drink. 
Sprinkle Zamphuor. Add an olive. 
Drink... but... very carefully... 
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy sells rather better than the Encyclopedia Galactica. 
"Six pints of bitter," said Ford Prefect to the barman of the Horse and Groom. "And quickly please, the world's about to end." 
The barman of the Horse and Groom didn't deserve this sort of treatment, he was a dignified old man. He pushed his glasses up his nose and blinked at Ford Prefect. Ford ignored him and stared out of the window, so the barman looked instead at Arthur who shrugged helplessly and said nothing. 
So the barman said, "Oh yes sir? Nice weather for it," and started pulling pints. 
He tried again. 
"Going to watch the match this afternoon then?" 
Ford glanced round at him. 
"No, no point," he said, and looked back out of the window. 
"What's that, foregone conclusion then you reckon sir?" said the barman. "Arsenal without a chance?" 
"No, no," said Ford, "it's just that the world's about to end." 
"Oh yes sir, so you said," said the barman, looking over his glasses this time at Arthur. "Lucky escape for Arsenal if it did." 
Ford looked back at him, genuinely surprised. 
"No, not really," he said. He frowned. 
The barman breathed in heavily. "There you are sir, six pints," he said. 
Arthur smiled at him wanly and shrugged again. He turned and smiled wanly at the rest of the pub just in case any of them had heard what was going on. 
None of them had, and none of them could understand what he was smiling at them for. 
A man sitting next to Ford at the bar looked at the two men, looked at the six pints, did a swift burst of mental arithmetic, arrived at an answer he liked and grinned a stupid hopeful grin at them. 
"Get off," said Ford, "They're ours," giving him a look that would have an Algolian Suntiger get on with what it was doing. 
Ford slapped a five-pound note on the bar. He said, "Keep the change." 
"What, from a fiver? Thank you sir." 
"You've got ten minutes left to spend it." 
The barman simply decided to walk away for a bit. 
"Ford," said Arthur, "would you please tell me what the hell is going on?" 
"Drink up," said Ford, "you've got three pints to get through." 
"Three pints?" said Arthur. "At lunchtime?" 
The man next to ford grinned and nodded happily. Ford ignored him. He said, "Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so." 
"Very deep," said Arthur, "you should send that in to the Reader's Digest. They've got a page for people like you." 
"Drink up." 
"Why three pints all of a sudden?" 
"Muscle relaxant, you'll need it." 
"Muscle relaxant?" 
"Muscle relaxant." 
Arthur stared into his beer. 
"Did I do anything wrong today," he said, "or has the world always been like this and I've been too wrapped up in myself to notice?" 
"Alright," said Ford, "I'll try to explain. How long have we known each other?" 
"How long?" Arthur thought. "Er, about five years, maybe six," he said. "Most of it seemed to make some sense at the time." 
"Alright," said Ford. "How would you react if I said that I'm not from Guildford after all, but from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse?" 
Arthur shrugged in a so-so sort of way. 
"I don't know," he said, taking a pull of beer. "Why do you think it's the sort of thing you're likely to say?" 
Ford gave up. It really wasn't worth bothering at the moment, what with the world being about to end. He just said: 
"Drink up."â¨He added, perfectly factually: 
"The world's about to end." 
Arthur gave the rest of the pub another wan smile. The rest of the pub frowned at him. A man waved at him to stop smiling at them and mind his own business. 
"This must be Thursday," said Arthur musing to himself, sinking low over his beer, "I never could get the hang of Thursdays." 
Chapter 3 
On this particular Thursday, something was moving quietly through the ionosphere many miles above the surface of the planet; several somethings in fact, several dozen huge yellow chunky slablike somethings, huge as office buildings, silent as birds. They soared with ease, basking in electromagnetic rays from the star Sol, biding their time, grouping, preparing. 
The planet beneath them was almost perfectly oblivious of their presence, which was just how they wanted it for the moment. The huge yellow somethings went unnoticed at Goonhilly, they passed over Cape Canaveral without a blip, Woomera and Jodrell Bank looked straight through them which was a pity because it was exactly the sort of thing they'd been looking for all these years. 
The only place they registered at all was on a small black device called a Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic which winked away quietly to itself. It nestled in the darkness inside a leather satchel which Ford Prefect wore habitually round his neck. The contents of Ford Prefect's satchel were quite interesting in fact and would have made any Earth physicist's eyes pop out of his head, which is why he always concealed them by keeping a couple of dog-eared scripts for plays he pretended he was auditioning for stuffed in the top. Besides the Sub-Etha Sens- O-Matic and the scripts he had an Electronic Thumb a short squat black rod, smooth and matt with a couple of flat switches and dials at one end; he also had a device which looked rather like a largish electronic calculator. This had about a hundred tiny flat press buttons and a screen about four inches square on which any one of a million "pages" could be summoned at a moment's notice. It looked insanely complicated, and this was one of the reasons why the snug plastic cover it fitted into had the words Don't Panic printed on it in large friendly letters. The other reason was that this device was in fact that most remarkable of all books ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of Ursa Minor The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The reason why it was published in the form of a micro sub meson 
electronic component is that if it were printed in normal book form, an interstellar hitch hiker would require several inconveniently large buildings to carry it around in. 
Beneath that in Ford Prefect's satchel were a few biros, a notepad, and a largish bath towel from Marks and Spencer. 
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has a few things to say on the subject of towels. 
A towel, it says, is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitch hiker can have. Partly it has great practical value you can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapours; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a mini raft down the slow heavy river Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand-combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or to avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a mindboggingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't see you daft as a bush, but very ravenous); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough. 
More importantly, a towel has immense psychological value. For some reason, if a strag (strag: non-hitch hiker) discovers that a hitch hiker has his towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a toothbrush, face flannel, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet weather gear, space suit etc., etc. Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the hitch hiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitch hiker might accidentally have "lost". What the strag will think is that any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle against terrible odds, win through, and still knows where his towel is is clearly a man to be reckoned with. 
Hence a phrase which has passed into hitch hiking slang, as in "Hey, you sass that hoopy Ford Prefect? There's a frood who really knows where his towel is." (Sass: know, be aware of, meet, have sex with; hoopy: really together guy; frood: really amazingly together guy.) 
Nestling quietly on top of the towel in Ford Prefect's satchel, the Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic began to wink more quickly. Miles above the surface of the planet the huge yellow somethings began to fan out. At Jodrell Bank, someone decided it was time for a nice relaxing cup of tea. 
"You got a towel with you?" said Ford Prefect suddenly to Arthur. 
Arthur, struggling through his third pint, looked round at him. 
"Why? What, no... should I have?" He had given up being surprised, there didn't seem to be any point any longer. 
Ford clicked his tongue in irritation. 
"Drink up," he urged. 
At that moment the dull sound of a rumbling crash from outside filtered through the low murmur of the pub, through the sound of the jukebox, through the sound of the man next to Ford hiccupping over the whisky Ford had eventually bought him. 
Arthur choked on his beer, leapt to his feet. 
"What's that?" he yelped. 
"Don't worry," said Ford, "they haven't started yet." 
"Thank God for that," said Arthur and relaxed. 
"It's probably just your house being knocked down," said Ford, drowning his last pint. 
"What?" shouted Arthur. Suddenly Ford's spell was broken. Arthur looked wildly around him and ran to the window. 
"My God they are! They're knocking my house down. What the hell am I doing in the pub, Ford?" 
"It hardly makes any difference at this stage," said Ford, "let them have their fun." 
"Fun?" yelped Arthur. "Fun!" He quickly checked out of the window again that they were talking about the same thing. 
"Damn their fun!" he hooted and ran out of the pub furiously waving a nearly empty beer glass. He made no friends at all in the pub that lunchtime. 
"Stop, you vandals! You home wreckers!" bawled Arthur. "You half crazed Visigoths, stop will you!" 
Ford would have to go after him. Turning quickly to the barman he asked for four packets of peanuts. 
"There you are sir," said the barman, slapping the packets on the bar, "twenty-eight pence if you'd be so kind." 
Ford was very kind he gave the barman another five-pound note and told him to keep the change. The barman looked at it and then looked at Ford. He suddenly shivered: he experienced a momentary sensation that he didn't understand because no one on Earth had ever experienced it before. In moments of great stress, every life form that exists gives out a tiny sublimal signal. This signal simply communicates an exact and almost pathetic sense of how far that being is from the place of his birth. On Earth it is never possible to be further than sixteen thousand miles from your birthplace, which really isn't very far, so such signals are too minute to be noticed. Ford Prefect was at this moment under great stress, and he was born 600 light years away in the near vicinity of Betelgeuse. 
The barman reeled for a moment, hit by a shocking, incomprehensible sense of distance. He didn't know what it meant, but he looked at Ford Prefect with a new sense of respect, almost awe. 
"Are you serious, sir?" he said in a small whisper which had the effect of silencing the pub. "You think the world's going to end?" 
"Yes," said Ford. 
"But, this afternoon?" 
Ford had recovered himself. He was at his flippest. 
"Yes," he said gaily, "in less than two minutes I would estimate." 
The barman couldn't believe the conversation he was having, but he couldn't believe the sensation he had just had either. 
"Isn't there anything we can do about it then?" he said. 
"No, nothing," said Ford, stuffing the peanuts into his pockets. 
Someone in the hushed bar suddenly laughed raucously at how stupid everyone had become. 
The man sitting next to Ford was a bit sozzled by now. His eyes waved their way up to Ford. 
"I thought," he said, "that if the world was going to end we were meant to lie down or put a paper bag over our head or something." 
"If you like, yes," said Ford. 
"That's what they told us in the army," said the man, and his eyes began the long trek back down to his whisky. 
"Will that help?" asked the barman. 
"No," said Ford and gave him a friendly smile. "Excuse me," he said, "I've got to go." With a wave, he left. 
The pub was silent for a moment longer, and then, embarrassingly enough, the man with the raucous laugh did it again. The girl he had dragged along to the pub with him had grown to loathe him dearly over the last hour or so, and it would probably have been a great satisfaction to her to know that in a minute and a half or so he would suddenly evaporate into a whiff of hydrogen, ozone and carbon monoxide. However, when the moment came she would be too busy evaporating herself to notice it. 
The barman cleared his throat. He heard himself say: "Last orders, please." 
The huge yellow machines began to sink downward and to move faster. 
Ford knew they were there. This wasn't the way he had wanted it. 
Running up the lane, Arthur had nearly reached his house. He didn't notice how cold it had suddenly become, he didn't notice the wind, he didn't notice the sudden irrational squall of rain. He didn't notice anything but the caterpillar bulldozers crawling over the rubble that had been his home. 
"You barbarians!" he yelled. "I'll sue the council for every penny it's got! I'll have you hung, drawn and quartered! And whipped! And boiled... until... until... until you've had enough." 
Ford was running after him very fast. Very very fast. 
"And then I'll do it again!" yelled Arthur. "And when I've finished I will take all the little bits, and I will jump on them!" 
Arthur didn't notice that the men were running from the bulldozers; he didn't notice that Mr. Prosser was staring hectically into the sky. What Mr. Prosser had noticed was that huge yellow somethings were screaming through the clouds. Impossibly huge yellow somethings. 
"And I will carry on jumping on them," yelled Arthur, still running, "until I get blisters, or I can think of anything even more unpleasant to do, and then..." 
Arthur tripped, and fell headlong, rolled and landed flat on his back. At last he noticed that something was going on. His finger shot upwards. 
"What the hell's that?" he shrieked. 
Whatever it was raced across the sky in monstrous yellowness, tore the sky apart with mind-buggering noise and leapt off into the distance leaving the gaping air to shut behind it with a bang that drove your ears six feet into your skull. 
Another one followed and did the same thing only louder. 
It's difficult to say exactly what the people on the surface of the planet were doing now, because they didn't really know what they were doing themselves. None of it made a lot of sense running into houses, running out of houses, howling noiselessly at the noise. All around the world city streets exploded with people, cars slewed into each other as the noise fell on them and then rolled off like a tidal wave over hills and valleys, deserts and oceans, seeming to flatten everything it hit. 
Only one man stood and watched the sky, stood with terrible sadness in his eyes and rubber bungs in his ears. He knew exactly what was happening and had known ever since his Sub-Etha Sens-O- Matic had started winking in the dead of night beside his pillar and woken him with a start. It was what he had waited for all these years, but when he had deciphered the signal pattern sitting alone in his small dark room a coldness had gripped him and squeezed his heart. Of all the races in all of the Galaxy who could have come and said a big hello to planet Earth, he thought, didn't it just have to be the Vogons. 
Still he knew what he had to do. As the Vogon craft screamed through the air high above him he opened his satchel. He threw away a copy of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, he threw away a copy of Godspell: He wouldn't need them where he was going. Everything was ready, everything was prepared. 
He knew where his towel was. 
A sudden silence hit the Earth. If anything it was worse than the noise. For a while nothing happened. 
The great ships hung motionless in the air, over every nation on Earth. Motionless they hung, huge, heavy, steady in the sky, a blasphemy against nature. Many people went straight into shock as their minds tried to encompass what they were looking at. The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't. 
And still nothing happened. 
Then there was a slight whisper, a sudden spacious whisper of open ambient sound. Every hi-fi set in the world, every radio, every television, every cassette recorder, every woofer, every tweeter, every mid-range driver in the world quietly turned itself on. 
Every tin can, every dust bin, every window, every car, every wine glass, every sheet of rusty metal became activated as an acoustically perfect sounding board. 
Before the Earth passed away it was going to be treated to the very ultimate in sound reproduction, the greatest public address system ever built. But there was no concert, no music, no fanfare, just a simple message. 
"People of Earth, your attention please," a voice said, and it was wonderful. Wonderful perfect quadrophonic sound with distortion levels so low as to make a brave man weep. 
"This is Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic Hyperspace Planning Council," the voice continued. "As you will no doubt be aware, the plans for development of the outlying regions of the Galaxy require the building of a hyperspatial express route through your star system, and regrettably your planet is one of those scheduled for demolition. The process will take slightly less that two of your Earth minutes. Thank you." 
The PA died away. 
Uncomprehending terror settled on the watching people of Earth. The terror moved slowly through the gathered crowds as if they were iron fillings on a sheet of board and a magnet was moving beneath them. Panic sprouted again, desperate fleeing panic, but there was nowhere to flee to. 
Observing this, the Vogons turned on their PA again. It said: 
"There's no point in acting all surprised about it. All the planning charts and demolition orders have been on display in your local planning department on Alpha Centauri for fifty of your Earth years, so you've had plenty of time to lodge any formal complaint and it's far too late to start making a fuss about it now." 
The PA fell silent again and its echo drifted off across the land. The huge ships turned slowly in the sky with easy power. On the underside of each a hatchway opened, an empty black space. 
By this time somebody somewhere must have manned a radio transmitter, located a wavelength and broadcasted a message back to the Vogon ships, to plead on behalf of the planet. Nobody ever heard what they said, they only heard the reply. The PA slammed back into life again. The voice was annoyed. It said: 
"What do you mean you've never been to Alpha Centauri? For heaven's sake mankind, it's only four light years away you know. I'm sorry, but if you can't be bothered to take an interest in local affairs that's your own lookout. 
"Energize the demolition beams." 
Light poured out into the hatchways. 
"I don't know," said the voice on the PA, "apathetic bloody planet, I've no sympathy at all." It cut off. 
There was a terrible ghastly silence.â¨There was a terrible ghastly noise.â¨There was a terrible ghastly silence.â¨The Vogon Constructor fleet coasted away into the inky starry void. 
Chapter 4 
Far away on the opposite spiral arm of the Galaxy, five hundred thousand light years from the star Sol, Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of the Imperial Galactic Government, sped across the seas of Damogran, his ion drive delta boat winking and flashing in the Damogran sun. 
Damogran the hot; Damogran the remote; Damogran the almost totally unheard of. 
Damogran, secret home of the Heart of Gold. The boat sped on across the water. It would be some time before it reached its destination because Damogran is such an inconveniently arranged planet. It consists of nothing but middling to large desert islands separated by very pretty but annoyingly wide stretches of ocean. 
The boat sped on. 
Because of this topological awkwardness Damogran has always remained a deserted planet. This is why the Imperial Galactic Government chose Damogran for the Heart of Gold project, because it was so deserted and the Heart of Gold was so secret. 
The boat zipped and skipped across the sea, the sea that lay between the main islands of the only archipelago of any useful size on the whole planet. Zaphod Beeblebrox was on his way from the tiny spaceport on Easter Island (the name was an entirely meaningless coincidence in Galacticspeke, easter means small flat and light brown) to the Heart of Gold island, which by another meaningless coincidence was called France. 
One of the side effects of work on the Heart of Gold was a whole string of pretty meaningless coincidences. 
But it was not in any way a coincidence that today, the day of culmination of the project, the great day of unveiling, the day that the Heart of Gold was finally to be introduced to a marvelling Galaxy, was also a great day of culmination for Zaphod Beeblebrox. It was for the sake of this day that he had first decided to run for the Presidency, a 
decision which had sent waves of astonishment throughout the Imperial Galaxy. Zaphod Beeblebrox? President? Not the Zaphod Beeblebrox? Not the President? Many had seen it as a clinching proof that the whole of known creation had finally gone bananas. 
Zaphod grinned and gave the boat an extra kick of speed. 
Zaphod Beeblebrox, adventurer, ex-hippy, good timer, (crook? quite possibly), manic self-publicist, terribly bad at personal relationships, often thought to be completely out to lunch. 
President? 
No one had gone bananas, not in that way at least. 
Only six people in the entire Galaxy understood the principle on which the Galaxy was governed, and they knew that once Zaphod Beeblebrox had announced his intention to run as President it was more or less a fait accompli: he was the ideal Presidency fodder1. 
What they completely failed to understand was why Zaphod was doing it. 
He banked sharply, shooting a wild wall of water at the sun. 
Today was the day; today was the day when they would realize what Zaphod had been up to. Today was what Zaphod Beeblebrox's Presidency was all about. Today was also his two hundredth birthday, but that was just another meaningless coincidence. 
As he skipped his boat across the seas of Damogran he smiled quietly to himself about what a wonderful exciting day it was going to be. He relaxed and spread his two arms lazily across the seat back. He steered with an extra arm he'd recently fitted just beneath his right one to help improve his ski-boxing. 
"Hey," he cooed to himself, "you're a real cool boy you." But his nerves sang a song shriller than a dog whistle. 
The island of France was about twenty miles long, five miles across the middle, sandy and crescent shaped. In fact it seemed to exist not so much as an island in its own right as simply a means of defining the sweep and curve of a huge bay. This impression was heightened by the fact that the inner coastline of the crescent consisted almost entirely of steep cliffs. From the top of the cliff the land sloped slowly down five miles to the opposite shore. 
On top of the cliffs stood a reception committee. 
It consisted in large part of the engineers and researchers who had built the Heart of Gold mostly humanoid, but here and there were a few reptiloid atomineers, two or three green slyph-like maximegalacticans, an octopoid physucturalist or two and a Hooloovoo (a Hooloovoo is a super-intelligent shade of the color blue). All except the Hooloovoo were resplendent in their multi-colored ceremonial lab coats; the Hooloovoo had been temporarily refracted into a free standing prism for the occasion. 
There was a mood of immense excitement thrilling through all of them. Together and between them they had gone to and beyond the furthest limits of physical laws, restructured the fundamental fabric of matter, strained, twisted and broken the laws of possibility and impossibility, but still the greatest excitement of all seemed to be to meet a man with an orange sash round his neck. (An orange sash was what the President of the Galaxy traditionally wore.) It might not even have made much difference to them if they'd known exactly how much power the President of the Galaxy actually wielded: none at all. Only six people in the Galaxy knew that the job of the Galactic President was not to wield power but to attract attention away from it. 
Zaphod Beeblebrox was amazingly good at his job. 
The crowd gasped, dazzled by sun and seemanship, as the Presidential speedboat zipped round the headland into the bay. It flashed and shone as it came skating over the sea in wide skidding turns. 
In fact it didn't need to touch the water at all, because it was supported on a hazy cushion of ionized atoms but just for effect it was fitted with thin finblades which could be lowered into the water. They slashed sheets of water hissing into the air, carved deep gashes into the sea which swayed crazily and sank back foaming into the boat's wake as it careered across the bay. 
Zaphod loved effect: it was what he was best at. 
He twisted the wheel sharply, the boat slewed round in a wild scything skid beneath the cliff face and dropped to rest lightly on the rocking waves. 
Within seconds he ran out onto the deck and waved and grinned at over three billion people. The three billion people weren't actually there, but they watched his every gesture through the eyes of a small 
robot tri-D camera which hovered obsequiously in the air nearby. The antics of the President always made amazingly popular tri-D; that's what they were for. 
He grinned again. Three billion and six people didn't know it, but today would be a bigger antic than anyone had bargained for. 
The robot camera homed in for a close up on the more popular of his two heads and he waved again. He was roughly humanoid in appearance except for the extra head and third arm. His fair tousled hair stuck out in random directions, his blue eyes glinted with something completely unidentifiable, and his chins were almost always unshaven. 
A twenty-foot-high transparent globe floated next to his boat, rolling and bobbing, glistening in the brilliant sun. Inside it floated a wide semi-circular sofa upholstered in glorious red leather: the more the globe bobbed and rolled, the more the sofa stayed perfectly still, steady as an upholstered rock. Again, all done for effect as much as anything. 
Zaphod stepped through the wall of the globe and relaxed on the sofa. He spread his two arms lazily along the back and with the third brushed some dust off his knee. His heads looked about, smiling; he put his feet up. At any moment, he thought, he might scream. 
Water boiled up beneath the bubble, it seethed and spouted. The bubble surged into the air, bobbing and rolling on the water spout. Up, up it climbed, throwing stilts of light at the cliff. Up it surged on the jet, the water falling from beneath it, crashing back into the sea hundreds of feet below. 
Zaphod smiled, picturing himself. 
A thoroughly ridiculous form of transport, but a thoroughly beautiful one. 
At the top of the cliff the globe wavered for a moment, tipped on to a railed ramp, rolled down it to a small concave platform and riddled to a halt. 
To tremendous applause Zaphod Beeblebrox stepped out of the bubble, his orange sash blazing in the light. 
The President of the Galaxy had arrived. 
He waited for the applause to die down, then raised his hands in greeting. 
"Hi," he said. 
A government spider sidled up to him and attempted to press a copy of his prepared speech into his hands. Pages three to seven of the original version were at the moment floating soggily on the Damogran sea some five miles out from the bay. Pages one and two had been salvaged by a Damogran Frond Crested Eagle and had already become incorporated into an extraordinary new form of nest which the eagle had invented. It was constructed largely of paper and it was virtually impossible for a newly hatched baby eagle to break out of it. The Damogran Frond Crested Eagle had heard of the notion of survival of the species but wanted no truck with it. 
Zaphod Beeblebrox would not be needing his set speech and he gently deflected the one being offered him by the spider. 
"Hi," he said again. 
Everyone beamed at him, or, at least, nearly everyone. He singled out Trillian from the crowd. Trillian was a girl that Zaphod had picked up recently whilst visiting a planet, just for fun, incognito. She was slim, darkish, humanoid, with long waves of black hair, a full mouth, an odd little nob of a nose and ridiculously brown eyes. With her red head scarf knotted in that particular way and her long flowing silky brown dress she looked vaguely Arabic. Not that anyone there had ever heard of an Arab of course. The Arabs had very recently ceased to exist, and even when they had existed they were five hundred thousand light years from Damogran. Trillian wasn't anybody in particular, or so Zaphod claimed. She just went around with him rather a lot and told him what she thought of him. 
"Hi honey," he said to her. 
She flashed him a quick tight smile and looked away. Then she looked back for a moment and smiled more warmly but by this time he was looking at something else. 
"Hi," he said to a small knot of creatures from the press who were standing nearby wishing that he would stop saying Hi and get on with the quotes. He grinned at them particularly because he knew that in a few moments he would be giving them one hell of a quote. 
The next thing he said though was not a lot of use to them. One of the officials of the party had irritably decided that the President was clearly not in a mood to read the deliciously turned speech that had been written for him, and had flipped the switch on the remote 
control device in his pocket. Away in front of them a huge white dome that bulged against the sky cracked down in the middle, split, and slowly folded itself down into the ground. Everyone gasped although they had known perfectly well it was going to do that because they had built it that way. 
Beneath it lay uncovered a huge starship, one hundred and fifty metres long, shaped like a sleek running shoe, perfectly white and mindboggingly beautiful. At the heart of it, unseen, lay a small gold box which carried within it the most brain-wretching device ever conceived, a device which made this starship unique in the history of the galaxy, a device after which the ship had been named The Heart of Gold. 
"Wow", said Zaphod Beeblebrox to the Heart of Gold. There wasn't much else he could say. 
He said it again because he knew it would annoy the press. 
"Wow." 
The crowd turned their faces back towards him expectantly. He winked at Trillian who raised her eyebrows and widened her eyes at him. She knew what he was about to say and thought him a terrible showoff. 
"That is really amazing," he said. "That really is truly amazing. That is so amazingly amazing I think I'd like to steal it." 
A marvellous Presidential quote, absolutely true to form. The crowd laughed appreciatively, the newsmen gleefully punched buttons on their Sub-Etha News-Matics and the President grinned. 
As he grinned his heart screamed unbearably and he fingered the small Paralyso-Matic bomb that nestled quietly in his pocket. 
Finally he could bear it no more. He lifted his heads up to the sky, let out a wild whoop in major thirds, threw the bomb to the ground and ran forward through the sea of suddenly frozen smiles. 
Chapter 5 
Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was not a pleasant sight, even for other Vogons. His highly domed nose rose high above a small piggy forehead. His dark green rubbery skin was thick enough for him to play the game of Vogon Civil Service politics, and play it well, and waterproof enough for him to survive indefinitely at sea depths of up to a thousand feet with no ill effects. 
Not that he ever went swimming of course. His busy schedule would not allow it. He was the way he was because billions of years ago when the Vogons had first crawled out of the sluggish primeval seas of Vogsphere, and had lain panting and heaving on the planet's virgin shores... when the first rays of the bright young Vogsol sun had shone across them that morning, it was as if the forces of evolution had simply given up on them there and then, had turned aside in disgust and written them off as an ugly and unfortunate mistake. They never evolved again; they should never have survived. 
The fact that they did is some kind of tribute to the thick-willed slug-brained stubbornness of these creatures. Evolution? they said to themselves, Who needs it?, and what nature refused to do for them they simply did without until such time as they were able to rectify the grosser anatomical inconveniences with surgery. 
Meanwhile, the natural forces on the planet Vogsphere had been working overtime to make up for their earlier blunder. They brought forth scintillating jewelled scuttling crabs, which the Vogons ate, smashing their shells with iron mallets; tall aspiring trees with breathtaking slenderness and colour which the Vogons cut down and burned the crab meat with; elegant gazelle-like creatures with silken coats and dewy eyes which the Vogons would catch and sit on. They were no use as transport because their backs would snap instantly, but the Vogons sat on them anyway. 
Thus the planet Vogsphere whiled away the unhappy millennia until the Vogons suddenly discovered the principles of interstellar travel. Within a few short Vog years every last Vogon had migrated to 
the Megabrantis cluster, the political hub of the Galaxy and now formed the immensely powerful backbone of the Galactic Civil Service. They have attempted to acquire learning, they have attempted to acquire style and social grace, but in most respects the modern Vogon is little different from his primitive forebears. Every year they import twenty-seven thousand scintillating jewelled scuttling crabs from their native planet and while away a happy drunken night smashing themâ¨to bits with iron mallets. 
Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was a fairly typical Vogon in that he was thoroughly vile. Also, he did not like hitchhikers. 
Somewhere in a small dark cabin buried deep in the intestines of Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz's flagship, a small match flared nervously. The owner of the match was not a Vogon, but he knew all about them and was right to be nervous. His name was Ford Prefect2. 
He looked about the cabin but could see very little; strange monstrous shadows loomed and leaped with the tiny flickering flame, but all was quiet. He breathed a silent thank you to the Dentrassis. The Dentrassis are an unruly tribe of gourmands, a wild but pleasant bunch whom the Vogons had recently taken to employing as catering staff on their long haul fleets, on the strict understanding that they keep themselves very much to themselves. 
This suited the Dentrassis fine, because they loved Vogon money, which is one of the hardest currencies in space, but loathed the Vogons themselves. The only sort of Vogon a Dentrassi liked to see was an annoyed Vogon. 
It was because of this tiny piece of information that Ford Prefect was not now a whiff of hydrogen, ozone and carbon monoxide. 
He heard a slight groan. By the light of the match he saw a heavy shape moving slightly on the floor. Quickly he shook the match out, reached in his pocket, found what he was looking for and took it out. He crouched on the floor. The shape moved again. 
Ford Prefect said: "I bought some peanuts." 
Arthur Dent moved, and groaned again, muttering incoherently. 
"Here, have some," urged Ford, shaking the packet again, "if you've never been through a matter transference beam before you've 
probably lost some salt and protein. The beer you had should have cushioned your system a bit." 
"Whhhrrrr..." said Arthur Dent. He opened his eyes. "It's dark," he said.â¨"Yes," said Ford Prefect, "it's dark."â¨"No light," said Arthur Dent. "Dark, no light." 
One of the things Ford Prefect had always found hardest to understand about human beings was their habit of continually stating and repeating the obvious, as in It's a nice day, or You're very tall, or Oh dear you seem to have fallen down a thirty-foot well, are you alright? At first Ford had formed a theory to account for this strange behaviour. If human beings don't keep exercising their lips, he thought, their mouths probably seize up. After a few months' consideration and observation he abandoned this theory in favour of a new one. If they don't keep on exercising their lips, he thought, their brains start working. After a while he abandoned this one as well as being obstructively cynical and decided he quite liked human beings after all, but he always remained desperately worried about the terrible number of things they didn't know about. 
"Yes," he agreed with Arthur, "no light." He helped Arthur to some peanuts. "How do you feel?" he asked. 
"Like a military academy," said Arthur, "bits of me keep on passing out." 
Ford stared at him blankly in the darkness. 
"If I asked you where the hell we were," said Arthur weakly, "would I regret it?" 
Ford stood up. "We're safe," he said. 
"Oh good," said Arthur. 
"We're in a small galley cabin," said Ford, "in one of the spaceships of the Vogon Constructor Fleet." 
"Ah," said Arthur, "this is obviously some strange usage of the word safe that I wasn't previously aware of." 
Ford struck another match to help him search for a light switch. Monstrous shadows leaped and loomed again. Arthur struggled to his feet and hugged himself apprehensively. Hideous alien shapes seemed to throng about him, the air was thick with musty smells 
which sidled into his lungs without identifying themselves, and a low irritating hum kept his brain from focusing. 
"How did we get here?" he asked, shivering slightly. 
"We hitched a lift," said Ford. 
"Excuse me?" said Arthur. "Are you trying to tell me that we just stuck out our thumbs and some green bug-eyed monster stuck his head out and said, Hi fellas, hop right in. I can take you as far as the Basingstoke roundabout?" 
"Well," said Ford, "the Thumb's an electronic sub-etha signalling device, the roundabout's at Barnard's Star six light years away, but otherwise, that's more or less right." 
"And the bug-eyed monster?" 
"Is green, yes." 
"Fine," said Arthur, "when can I get home?" 
"You can't," said Ford Prefect, and found the light switch. 
"Shade your eyes..." he said, and turned it on. 
Even Ford was surprised. 
"Good grief," said Arthur, "is this really the interior of a flying saucer?" 
Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz heaved his unpleasant green body round the control bridge. He always felt vaguely irritable after demolishing populated planets. He wished that someone would come and tell him that it was all wrong so that he could shout at them and feel better. He flopped as heavily as he could on to his control seat in the hope that it would break and give him something to be genuinely angry about, but it only gave a complaining sort of creak. 
"Go away!" he shouted at a young Vogon guard who entered the bridge at that moment. The guard vanished immediately, feeling rather relieved. He was glad it wouldn't now be him who delivered the report they'd just received. The report was an official release which said that a wonderful new form of spaceship drive was at this moment being unveiled at a government research base on Damogran which would henceforth make all hyperspatial express routes unnecessary. 
Another door slid open, but this time the Vogon captain didn't shout because it was the door from the galley quarters where the Dentrassis prepared his meals. A meal would be most welcome. 
A huge furry creature bounded through the door with his lunch tray. It was grinning like a maniac. 
Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was delighted. He knew that when a Dentrassi looked that pleased with itself there was something going on somewhere on the ship that he could get very angry indeed about. 
Ford and Arthur stared about them. "Well, what do you think?" said Ford. "It's a bit squalid, isn't it?" 
Ford frowned at the grubby mattress, unwashed cups and unidentifiable bits of smelly alien underwear that lay around the cramped cabin. 
"Well, this is a working ship, you see," said Ford. "These are the Dentrassi sleeping quarters." 
"I thought you said they were called Vogons or something." 
"Yes," said Ford, "the Vogons run the ship, the Dentrassis are the cooks, they let us on board." 
"I'm confused," said Arthur. 
"Here, have a look at this," said Ford. He sat down on one of the mattresses and rummaged about in his satchel. Arthur prodded the mattress nervously and then sat on it himself: in fact he had very little to be nervous about, because all mattresses grown in the swamps of Squornshellous Zeta are very thoroughly killed and dried before being put to service. Very few have ever come to life again. 
Ford handed the book to Arthur. 
"What is it?" asked Arthur. 
"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It's a sort of electronic book. It tells you everything you need to know about anything. That's its job." 
Arthur turned it over nervously in his hands. 
"I like the cover," he said. "Don't Panic. It's the first helpful or intelligible thing anybody's said to me all day." 
"I'll show you how it works," said Ford. He snatched it from Arthur who was still holding it as if it was a two-week-dead lark and pulled it out of its cover. 
"You press this button here you see and the screen lights up giving you the index." 
A screen, about three inches by four, lit up and characters began to flicker across the surface. 
"You want to know about Vogons, so I enter that name so." His fingers tapped some more keys. "And there we are." 
The words Vogon Constructor Fleets flared in green across the screen. 
Ford pressed a large red button at the bottom of the screen and words began to undulate across it. At the same time, the book began to speak the entry as well in a still quiet measured voice. This is what the book said. 
"Vogon Constructor Fleets. Here is what to do if you want to get a lift from a Vogon: forget it. They are one of the most unpleasant races in the Galaxy not actually evil, but bad tempered, bureaucratic, officious and callous. They wouldn't even lift a finger to save their own grandmothers from the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal without orders signed in triplicate, sent in, sent back, queried, lost, found, subjected to public inquiry, lost again, and finally buried in soft peat and recycled as firelighters." 
"The best way to get a drink out of a Vogon is to stick your finger down his throat, and the best way to irritate him is to feed his grandmother to the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal." 
"On no account allow a Vogon to read poetry at you." Arthur blinked at it.â¨"What a strange book. How did we get a lift then?" 
"That's the point, it's out of date now," said Ford, sliding the book back into its cover. "I'm doing the field research for the New Revised Edition, and one of the things I'll have to include is a bit about how the Vogons now employ Dentrassi cooks which gives us a rather useful little loophole." 
A pained expression crossed Arthur's face. "But who are the Dentrassi?" he said. 
"Great guys," said Ford. "They're the best cooks and the best drink mixers and they don't give a wet slap about anything else. And they'll always help hitchhikers aboard, partly because they like the company, but mostly because it annoys the Vogons. Which is exactly the sort of thing you need to know if you're an impoverished hitch hiker trying to see the marvels of the Universe for less than thirty Altairan Dollars a day. And that's my job. Fun, isn't it?" 
Arthur looked lost. 
"It's amazing," he said and frowned at one of the other mattresses. 
"Unfortunately I got stuck on the Earth for rather longer than I intended," said Ford. "I came for a week and got stuck for fifteen years." 
"But how did you get there in the first place then?" "Easy, I got a lift with a teaser."â¨"A teaser?"â¨"Yeah." 
"Er, what is..." 
"A teaser? Teasers are usually rich kids with nothing to do. They cruise around looking for planets which haven't made interstellar contact yet and buzz them." 
"Buzz them?" Arthur began to feel that Ford was enjoying making life difficult for him. 
"Yeah", said Ford, "they buzz them. They find some isolated spot with very few people around, then land right by some poor soul whom no one's ever going to believe and then strut up and down in front of him wearing silly antennae on their heads and making beep beep noises. Rather childish really." Ford leant back on the mattress with his hands behind his head and looked infuriatingly pleased with himself. 
"Ford," insisted Arthur, "I don't know if this sounds like a silly question, but what am I doing here?" 
"Well you know that," said Ford. "I rescued you from the Earth." "And what's happened to the Earth?"â¨"Ah. It's been demolished."â¨"Has it," said Arthur levelly. 
"Yes. It just boiled away into space." 
"Look," said Arthur, "I'm a bit upset about that." 
Ford frowned to himself and seemed to roll the thought around his mind. 
"Yes, I can understand that," he said at last. 
"Understand that!" shouted Arthur. "Understand that!" 
Ford sprang up. 
"Keep looking at the book!" he hissed urgently. 
"What?" 
"Don't Panic." 
"I'm not panicking!" 
"Yes you are." 
"Alright so I'm panicking, what else is there to do?" 
"You just come along with me and have a good time. The Galaxy's a fun place. You'll need to have this fish in your ear." 
"I beg your pardon?" asked Arthur, rather politely he thought. 
Ford was holding up a small glass jar which quite clearly had a small yellow fish wriggling around in it. Arthur blinked at him. He wished there was something simple and recognizable he could grasp hold of. He would have felt safe if alongside the Dentrassi underwear, the piles of Squornshellous mattresses and the man from Betelgeuse holding up a small yellow fish and offering to put it in his ear he had been able to see just a small packet of corn flakes. He couldn't, and he didn't feel safe. 
Suddenly a violent noise leapt at them from no source that he could identify. He gasped in terror at what sounded like a man trying to gargle whilst fighting off a pack of wolves. 
"Shush!" said Ford. "Listen, it might be important."â¨"Im... important?"â¨"It's the Vogon captain making an announcement on the T'annoy." "You mean that's how the Vogons talk?"â¨"Listen!"â¨"But I can't speak Vogon!"â¨"You don't need to. Just put that fish in your ear." 
Ford, with a lightning movement, clapped his hand to Arthur's ear, and he had the sudden sickening sensation of the fish slithering deep 
into his aural tract. Gasping with horror he scrabbled at his ear for a second or so, but then slowly turned goggle-eyed with wonder. He was experiencing the aural equivalent of looking at a picture of two black silhouetted faces and suddenly seeing it as a picture of a white candlestick. Or of looking at a lot of coloured dots on a piece of paper which suddenly resolve themselves into the figure six and mean that your optician is going to charge you a lot of money for a new pair of glasses. 
He was still listening to the howling gargles, he knew that, only now it had taken on the semblance of perfectly straightforward English. 
This is what he heard... 
Chapter 6 
"Howl howl gargle howl gargle howl howl howl gargle howl gargle howl howl gargle gargle howl gargle gargle gargle howl slurrp uuuurgh should have a good time. Message repeats. This is your captain speaking, so stop whatever you're doing and pay attention. First of all I see from our instruments that we have a couple of hitchhikers aboard. Hello wherever you are. I just want to make it totally clear that you are not at all welcome. I worked hard to get where I am today, and I didn't become captain of a Vogon constructor ship simply so I could turn it into a taxi service for a load of degenerate freeloaders. I have sent out a search party, and as soon that they find you I will put you off the ship. If you're very lucky I might read you some of my poetry first." 
"Secondly, we are about to jump into hyperspace for the journey to Barnard's Star. On arrival we will stay in dock for a seventy-two hour refit, and no one's to leave the ship during that time. I repeat, all planet leave is cancelled. I've just had an unhappy love affair, so I don't see why anybody else should have a good time. Message ends." 
The noise stopped. 
Arthur discovered to his embarrassment that he was lying curled up in a small ball on the floor with his arms wrapped round his head. He smiled weakly. 
"Charming man," he said. "I wish I had a daughter so I could forbid her to marry one..." 
"You wouldn't need to," said Ford. "They've got as much sex appeal as a road accident. No, don't move," he added as Arthur began to uncurl himself, "you'd better be prepared for the jump into hyperspace. It's unpleasantly like being drunk." 
"What's so unpleasant about being drunk?" "You ask a glass of water."â¨Arthur thought about this.â¨"Ford," he said. 
"Yeah?" 
"What's this fish doing in my ear?" 
"It's translating for you. It's a Babel fish. Look it up in the book if you like." 
He tossed over The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and then curled himself up into a foetal ball to prepare himself for the jump. 
At that moment the bottom fell out of Arthur's mind. 
His eyes turned inside out. His feet began to leak out of the top of his head. 
The room folded flat about him, spun around, shifted out of existence and left him sliding into his own navel. 
They were passing through hyperspace. 
"The Babel fish," said The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy quietly, "is small, yellow and leech-like, and probably the oddest thing in the Universe. It feeds on brainwave energy not from its carrier but from those around it. It absorbs all unconscious mental frequencies from this brainwave energy to nourish itself with. It then excretes into the mind of its carrier a telepathic matrix formed by combining the conscious thought frequencies with nerve signals picked up from the speech centres of the brain which has supplied them. The practical upshot of all this is that if you stick a Babel fish in your ear you can instantly understand anything said to you in any form of language. The speech patterns you actually hear decode the brainwave matrix which has been fed into your mind by your Babel fish." 
"Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so mindboggingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some thinkers have chosen to see it as the final and clinching proof of the non-existence of God." 
"The argument goes something like this: 'I refuse to prove that I exist,' says God, 'for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing.'" 
"'But,' says Man, 'The Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn't it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and so therefore, by your own arguments, you don't. QED.'" 
"'Oh dear,' says God, 'I hadn't thought of that,' and promptly vanished in a puff of logic." 
"'Oh, that was easy,' says Man, and for an encore goes on to prove that black is white and gets himself killed on the next zebra crossing." 
"Most leading theologians claim that this argument is a load of dingo's kidneys, but that didn't stop Oolon Colluphid making a small fortune when he used it as the central theme of his best-selling book Well That About Wraps It Up For God." 
"Meanwhile, the poor Babel fish, by effectively removing all barriers to communication between different races and cultures, has caused more and bloddier wars than anything else in the history of creation." 
Arthur let out a low groan. He was horrified to discover that the kick through hyperspace hadn't killed him. He was now six light years from the place that the Earth would have been if it still existed. 
The Earth. 
Visions of it swam sickeningly through his nauseated mind. There was no way his imagination could feel the impact of the whole Earth having gone, it was too big. He prodded his feelings by thinking that his parents and his sister had gone. No reaction. He thought of all the people he had been close to. No reaction. Then he thought of a complete stranger he had been standing behind in the queue at the supermarket before and felt a sudden stab the supermarket was gone, everything in it was gone. Nelson's Column had gone! Nelson's Column had gone and there would be no outcry, because there was no one left to make an outcry. From now on Nelson's Column only existed in his mind. England only existed in his mind his mind, stuck here in this dank smelly steel-lined spaceship. A wave of claustrophobia closed in on him. 
England no longer existed. He'd got that somehow he'd got it. He tried again. America, he thought, has gone. He couldn't grasp it. He decided to start smaller again. New York has gone. No reaction. He'd never seriously believed it existed anyway. The dollar, he thought, had sunk for ever. Slight tremor there. Every Bogart movie has been wiped, he said to himself, and that gave him a nasty knock. McDonalds, he thought. There is no longer any such thing as a McDonald's hamburger. 
He passed out. When he came round a second later he found he was sobbing for his mother. 
He jerked himself violently to his feet. 
"Ford!" 
Ford looked up from where he was sitting in a corner humming to himself. He always found the actual travelling-through-space part of space travel rather trying. 
"Yeah?" he said. 
"If you're a researcher on this book thing and you were on Earth, you must have been gathering material on it." 
"Well, I was able to extend the original entry a bit, yes."â¨"Let me see what it says in this edition then, I've got to see it." "Yeah OK." He passed it over again. 
Arthur grabbed hold of it and tried to stop his hands shaking. He pressed the entry for the relevant page. The screen flashed and swirled and resolved into a page of print. Arthur stared at it. 
"It doesn't have an entry!" he burst out. 
Ford looked over his shoulder. 
"Yes it does," he said, "down there, see at the bottom of the screen, just under Eccentrica Gallumbits, the triple-breasted whore of Eroticon 6." 
Arthur followed Ford's finger, and saw where it was pointing. For a moment it still didn't register, then his mind nearly blew up. 
"What? Harmless? Is that all it's got to say? Harmless! One word!" 
Ford shrugged. 
"Well, there are a hundred billion stars in the Galaxy, and only a limited amount of space in the book's microprocessors," he said, "and no one knew much about the Earth of course." 
"Well for God's sake I hope you managed to rectify that a bit." 
"Oh yes, well I managed to transmit a new entry off to the editor. He had to trim it a bit, but it's still an improvement." 
"And what does it say now?" asked Arthur. 
"Mostly harmless," admitted Ford with a slightly embarrassed cough. 
"Mostly harmless!" shouted Arthur.â¨"What was that noise?" hissed Ford.â¨"It was me shouting," shouted Arthur.â¨"No! Shut up!" said Ford. I think we're in trouble." 
"You think we're in trouble!" 
Outside the door were the sounds of marching feet. 
"The Dentrassi?" whispered Arthur. 
"No, those are steel tipped boots," said Ford. 
There was a sharp ringing rap on the door. 
"Then who is it?" said Arthur. 
"Well," said Ford, "if we're lucky it's just the Vogons come to throw us in to space." 
"And if we're unlucky?" 
"If we're unlucky," said Ford grimly, "the captain might be serious in his threat that he's going to read us some of his poetry first..." 
Chapter 7 
Vogon poetry is of course the third worst in the Universe. 
The second worst is that of the Azagoths of Kria. During a recitation by their Poet Master Grunthos the Flatulent of his poem "Ode To A Small Lump of Green Putty I Found In My Armpit One Midsummer Morning" four of his audience died of internal haemorrhaging, and the President of the Mid-Galactic Arts Nobbling Council survived by gnawing one of his own legs off. Grunthos is reported to have been "disappointed" by the poem's reception, and was about to embark on a reading of his twelve-book epic entitled My Favourite Bathtime Gurgles when his own major intestine, in a desperate attempt to save life and civilization, leapt straight up through his neck and throttled his brain. 
The very worst poetry of all perished along with its creator Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings of Greenbridge, Essex, England in the destruction of the planet Earth. 
Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz smiled very slowly. This was done not so much for effect as because he was trying to remember the sequence of muscle movements. He had had a terribly therapeutic yell at his prisoners and was now feeling quite relaxed and ready for a little callousness. 
The prisoners sat in Poetry Appreciation Chairs strapped in. Vogons suffered no illusions as to the regard their works were generally held in. Their early attempts at composition had been part of bludgeoning insistence that they be accepted as a properly evolved and cultured race, but now the only thing that kept them going was sheer bloodymindedness. 
The sweat stood out cold on Ford Prefect's brow, and slid round the electrodes strapped to his temples. These were attached to a battery of electronic equipment imagery intensifiers, rhythmic modulators, alliterative residulators and simile dumpers all designed 
to heighten the experience of the poem and make sure that not a single nuance of the poet's thought was lost. 
Arthur Dent sat and quivered. He had no idea what he was in for, but he knew that he hadn't liked anything that had happened so far and didn't think things were likely to change. 
The Vogon began to read a fetid little passage of his own devising. 
"Oh frettled gruntbuggly..." he began. Spasms wracked Ford's body this was worse than ever he'd been prepared for. 
"?... thy micturations are to me | As plurdled gabbleblotchits on a lurgid bee." 
"Aaaaaaarggggghhhhhh!" went Ford Prefect, wrenching his head back as lumps of pain thumped through it. He could dimly see beside him Arthur lolling and rolling in his seat. He clenched his teeth. 
"Groop I implore thee," continued the merciless Vogon, "my foonting turlingdromes." 
His voice was rising to a horrible pitch of impassioned stridency. "And hooptiously drangle me with crinkly bindlewurdles,| Or I will rend thee in the gobberwarts with my blurglecruncheon, see if I don't!" 
"Nnnnnnnnnnyyyyyyyuuuuuuurrrrrrrggggggghhhhh!" cried Ford Prefect and threw one final spasm as the electronic enhancement of the last line caught him full blast across the temples. He went limp. 
Arthur lolled. 
"Now Earthlings..." whirred the Vogon (he didn't know that Ford Prefect was in fact from a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse, and wouldn't have cared if he had) "I present you with a simple choice! Either die in the vacuum of space, or..." he paused for melodramatic effect, "tell me how good you thought my poem was!" 
He threw himself backwards into a huge leathery bat-shaped seat and watched them. He did the smile again. 
Ford was rasping for breath. He rolled his dusty tongue round his parched mouth and moaned. 
Arthur said brightly: "Actually I quite liked it." 
Ford turned and gaped. Here was an approach that had quite simply not occurred to him. 
The Vogon raised a surprised eyebrow that effectively obscured his nose and was therefore no bad thing. 
"Oh good..." he whirred, in considerable astonishment. 
"Oh yes," said Arthur, "I thought that some of the metaphysical imagery was really particularly effective." 
Ford continued to stare at him, slowly organizing his thoughts around this totally new concept. Were they really going to be able to bareface their way out of this? 
"Yes, do continue..." invited the Vogon. 
"Oh... and er... interesting rhythmic devices too," continued Arthur, "which seemed to counterpoint the... er... er..." He floundered. 
Ford leaped to his rescue, hazarding "counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying metaphor of the... er..." He floundered too, but Arthur was ready again. 
"... humanity of the..." 
"Vogonity," Ford hissed at him. 
"Ah yes, Vogonity (sorry) of the poet's compassionate soul," Arthur felt he was on a home stretch now, "which contrives through the medium of the verse structure to sublimate this, transcend that, and come to terms with the fundamental dichotomies of the other," (he was reaching a triumphant crescendo...) "and one is left with a profound and vivid insight into... into... er..." (... which suddenly gave out on him.) Ford leaped in with the coup de grace: 
"Into whatever it was the poem was about!" he yelled. Out of the corner of his mouth: "Well done, Arthur, that was very good." 
The Vogon perused them. For a moment his embittered racial soul had been touched, but he thought no too little too late. His voice took on the quality of a cat snagging brushed nylon. 
"So what you're saying is that I write poetry because underneath my mean callous heartless exterior I really just want to be loved," he said. He paused. "Is that right?" 
Ford laughed a nervous laugh. "Well I mean yes," he said, "don't we all, deep down, you know... er..." 
The Vogon stood up. 
"No, well you're completely wrong," he said, "I just write poetry to throw my mean callous heartless exterior into sharp relief. I'm going 
to throw you off the ship anyway. Guard! Take the prisoners to number three airlock and throw them out!" 
"What?" shouted Ford. 
A huge young Vogon guard stepped forward and yanked them out of their straps with his huge blubbery arms. 
"You can't throw us into space," yelled Ford, "we're trying to write a book." 
"Resistance is useless!" shouted the Vogon guard back at him. It was the first phrase he'd learnt when he joined the Vogon Guard Corps. 
The captain watched with detached amusement and then turned away. 
Arthur stared round him wildly. 
"I don't want to die now!" he yelled. "I've still got a headache! I don't want to go to heaven with a headache, I'd be all cross and wouldn't enjoy it!" 
The guard grasped them both firmly round the neck, and bowing deferentially towards his captain's back, hoiked them both protesting out of the bridge. A steel door closed and the captain was on his own again. He hummed quietly and mused to himself, lightly fingering his notebook of verses. 
"Hmmmm," he said, "counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying metaphor..." He considered this for a moment, and then closed the book with a grim smile. 
"Death's too good for them," he said. 
The long steel-lined corridor echoed to the feeble struggles of the two humanoids clamped firmly under rubbery Vogon armpits. 
"This is great," spluttered Arthur, "this is really terrific. Let go of me you brute!" 
The Vogon guard dragged them on. 
"Don't you worry," said Ford, "I'll think of something." He didn't sound hopeful. 
"Resistance is useless!" bellowed the guard. 
"Just don't say things like that," stammered Ford. "How can anyone maintain a positive mental attitude if you're saying things like that?" 
"My God," complained Arthur, "you're talking about a positive mental attitude and you haven't even had your planet demolished today. I woke up this morning and thought I'd have a nice relaxed day, do a bit of reading, brush the dog... It's now just after four in the afternoon and I'm already thrown out of an alien spaceship six light years from the smoking remains of the Earth!" He spluttered and gurgled as the Vogon tightened his grip. 
"Alright," said Ford, "just stop panicking." 
"Who said anything about panicking?" snapped Arthur. "This is still just the culture shock. You wait till I've settled down into the situation and found my bearings. Then I'll start panicking." 
"Arthur you're getting hysterical. Shut up!" Ford tried desperately to think, but was interrupted by the guard shouting again. 
"Resistance is useless!" 
"And you can shut up as well!" snapped Ford. 
"Resistance is useless!" 
"Oh give it a rest," said Ford. He twisted his head till he was looking straight up into his captor's face. A thought struck him. 
"Do you really enjoy this sort of thing?" he asked suddenly. 
The Vogon stopped dead and a look of immense stupidity seeped slowly over his face. 
"Enjoy?" he boomed. "What do you mean?" 
"What I mean," said Ford, "is does it give you a full satisfying life? Stomping around, shouting, pushing people out of spaceships..." 
The Vogon stared up at the low steel ceiling and his eyebrows almost rolled over each other. His mouth slacked. Finally he said, "Well the hours are good..." 
"They'd have to be," agreed Ford. 
Arthur twisted his head to look at Ford. 
"Ford, what are you doing?" he asked in an amazed whisper. 
"Oh, just trying to take an interest in the world around me, OK?" he said. "So the hours are pretty good then?" he resumed. 
The Vogon stared down at him as sluggish thoughts moiled around in the murky depths. 
"Yeah," he said, "but now you come to mention it, most of the actual minutes are pretty lousy. Except..." he thought again, which 
required looking at the ceiling "except some of the shouting I quite like." He filled his lungs and bellowed, "Resistance is..." 
"Sure, yes," interrupted Ford hurriedly, "you're good at that, I can tell. But if it's mostly lousy," he said, slowly giving the words time to reach their mark, "then why do you do it? What is it? The girls? The leather? The machismo? Or do you just find that coming to terms with the mindless tedium of it all presents an interesting challenge?" 
"Er..." said the guard, "er... er... I dunno. I think I just sort of... do it really. My aunt said that spaceship guard was a good career for a young Vogon you know, the uniform, the low-slung stun ray holster, the mindless tedium..." 
"There you are Arthur," said Ford with the air of someone reaching the conclusion of his argument, "you think you've got problems." 
Arthur rather thought he had. Apart from the unpleasant business with his home planet the Vogon guard had half-throttled him already and he didn't like the sound of being thrown into space very much. 
"Try and understand his problem," insisted Ford. "Here he is poor lad, his entire life's work is stamping around, throwing people off spaceships..." 
"And shouting," added the guard. 
"And shouting, sure," said Ford patting the blubbery arm clamped round his neck in friendly condescension, "... and he doesn't even know why he's doing it!" 
Arthur agreed this was very sad. He did this with a small feeble gesture, because he was too asphyxicated to speak. 
Deep rumblings of bemusement came from the guard.â¨"Well. Now you put it like that I suppose..."â¨"Good lad!" encouraged Ford.â¨"But alright," went on the rumblings, "so what's the alternative?" 
"Well," said Ford, brightly but slowly, "stop doing it of course! Tell them," he went on, "you're not going to do it anymore." He felt he had to add something to that, but for the moment the guard seemed to have his mind occupied pondering that much. 
"Eerrrrrrmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm..." said the guard, "erm, well that doesn't sound that great to me." 
Ford suddenly felt the moment slipping away. 
"Now wait a minute," he said, "that's just the start you see, there's more to it than that you see..." 
But at that moment the guard renewed his grip and continued his original purpose of lugging his prisoners to the airlock. He was obviously quite touched. 
"No, I think if it's all the same to you," he said, "I'd better get you both shoved into this airlock and then go and get on with some other bits of shouting I've got to do." 
It wasn't all the same to Ford Prefect after all. 
"Come on now... but look!" he said, less slowly, less brightly. 
"Huhhhhgggggggnnnnnnn..." said Arthur without any clear inflection. 
"But hang on," pursued Ford, "there's music and art and things to tell you about yet! Arrrggghhh!" 
"Resistance is useless," bellowed the guard, and then added, "You see if I keep it up I can eventually get promoted to Senior Shouting Officer, and there aren't usually many vacancies for non-shouting and non-pushing-people-about officers, so I think I'd better stick to what I know." 
They had now reached the airlock a large circular steel hatchway of massive strength and weight let into the inner skin of the craft. The guard operated a control and the hatchway swung smoothly open. 
"But thanks for taking an interest," said the Vogon guard. "Bye now." He flung Ford and Arthur through the hatchway into the small chamber within. Arthur lay panting for breath. Ford scrambled round and flung his shoulder uselessly against the reclosing hatchway. 
"But listen," he shouted to the guard, "there's a whole world you don't know anything about... here how about this?" Desperately he grabbed for the only bit of culture he knew offhand he hummed the first bar of Beethoven's Fifth. 
"Da da da dum! Doesn't that stir anything in you?" 
"No," said the guard, "not really. But I'll mention it to my aunt." 
If he said anything further after that it was lost. The hatchway sealed itself tight, and all sound was lost but the faint distant hum of the ship's engines. 
They were in a brightly polished cylindrical chamber about six feet in diameter and ten feet long. 
"Potentially bright lad I thought," he said and slumped against the curved wall. 
Arthur was still lying in the curve of the floor where he had fallen. He didn't look up. He just lay panting. 
"We're trapped now aren't we?" 
"Yes," said Ford, "we're trapped." 
"Well didn't you think of anything? I thought you said you were going to think of something. Perhaps you thought of something and didn't notice." 
"Oh yes, I thought of something," panted Ford. Arthur looked up expectantly. 
"But unfortunately," continued Ford, "it rather involved being on the other side of this airtight hatchway." He kicked the hatch they'd just been through. 
"But it was a good idea was it?" 
"Oh yes, very neat." 
"What was it?" 
"Well I hadn't worked out the details yet. Not much point now is there?" 
"So... er, what happens next?" 
"Oh, er, well the hatchway in front of us will open automatically in a few moments and we will shoot out into deep space I expect and asphyxicate. If you take a lungful of air with you you can last for up to thirty seconds of course..." said Ford. He stuck his hands behind his back, raised his eyebrows and started to hum an old Betelgeusian battle hymn. To Arthur's eyes he suddenly looked very alien. 
"So this is it," said Arthur, "we're going to die." 
"Yes," said Ford, "except... no! Wait a minute!" he suddenly lunged across the chamber at something behind Arthur's line of vision. "What's this switch?" he cried. 
"What? Where?" cried Arthur twisting round. 
"No, I was only fooling," said Ford, "we are going to die after all." 
He slumped against the wall again and carried on the tune from where he left off. 
"You know," said Arthur, "it's at times like this, when I'm trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse, and about to die of 
asphyxication in deep space that I really wish I'd listened to what my mother told me when I was young." 
"Why, what did she tell you?"â¨"I don't know, I didn't listen." "Oh." Ford carried on humming. 
"This is terrific," Arthur thought to himself, "Nelson's Column has gone, McDonald's have gone, all that's left is me and the words Mostly Harmless. Any second now all that will be left is Mostly Harmless. And yesterday the planet seemed to be going so well." 
A motor whirred. 
A slight hiss built into a deafening roar of rushing air as the outer hatchway opened on to an empty blackness studded with tiny impossibly bright points of light. Ford and Arthur popped into outer space like corks from a toy gun. 
Chapter 8 
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a wholly remarkable book. It has been compiled and recompiled many times over many years and under many different editorships. It contains contributions from countless numbers of travellers and researchers. 
The introduction begins like this: 
"Space," it says, "is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly hugely mindboggingly big it is. I mean you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist, but that's just peanuts to space. Listen..." and so on. 
(After a while the style settles down a bit and it begins to tell you things you really need to know, like the fact that the fabulously beautiful planet Bethselamin is now so worried about the cumulative erosion by ten billion visiting tourists a year that any net imbalance between the amount you eat and the amount you excrete whilst on the planet is surgically removed from your bodyweight when you leave: so every time you go to the lavatory it is vitally important to get a receipt.) 
To be fair though, when confronted by the sheer enormity of distances between the stars, better minds than the one responsible for the Guide's introduction have faltered. Some invite you to consider for a moment a peanut in reading and a small walnut in Johannesburg, and other such dizzying concepts. 
The simple truth is that interstellar distances will not fit into the human imagination. 
Even light, which travels so fast that it takes most races thousands of years to realize that it travels at all, takes time to journey between the stars. It takes eight minutes from the star Sol to the place where the Earth used to be, and four years more to arrive at Sol's nearest stellar neighbour, Alpha Proxima. 
For light to reach the other side of the Galaxy, for it to reach Damogran for instance, takes rather longer: five hundred thousand years. 
The record for hitch hiking this distance is just under five years, but you don't get to see much on the way. 
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy says that if you hold a lungful of air you can survive in the total vacuum of space for about thirty seconds. However it goes on to say that what with space being the mind boggling size it is the chances of getting picked up by another ship within those thirty seconds are two to the power of two hundred and sixty-seven thousand seven hundred and nine to one against. 
By a totally staggering coincidence that is also the telephone number of an Islington flat where Arthur once went to a very good party and met a very nice girl whom he totally failed to get off with she went off with a gatecrasher. 
Though the planet Earth, the Islington flat and the telephone have all now been demolished, it is comforting to reflect that they are all in some small way commemorated by the fact that twenty-nine seconds later Ford and Arthur were rescued. 
Chapter 9 
A computer chatted to itself in alarm as it noticed an airlock open and close itself for no apparent reason. 
This was because Reason was in fact out to lunch. 
A hole had just appeared in the Galaxy. It was exactly a nothingth of a second long, a nothingth of an inch wide, and quite a lot of million light years from end to end. 
As it closed up lots of paper hats and party balloons fell out of it and drifted off through the universe. A team of seven three-foot-high market analysts fell out of it and died, partly of asphyxication, partly of surprise. 
Two hundred and thirty-nine thousand lightly fried eggs fell out of it too, materializing in a large woobly heap on the famine struck land of Poghril in the Pansel system. 
The whole Poghril tribe had died out from famine except for one last man who died of cholesterol poisoning some weeks later. 
The nothingth of a second for which the hole existed reverberated backwards and forwards through time in a most improbable fashion. Somewhere in the deeply remote past it seriously traumatized a small random group of atoms drifting through the empty sterility of space and made them cling together in the most extraordinarily unlikely patterns. These patterns quickly learnt to copy themselves (this was part of what was so extraordinary of the patterns) and went on to cause massive trouble on every planet they drifted on to. That was how life began in the Universe. 
Five wild Event Maelstroms swirled in vicious storms of unreason and spewed up a pavement. 
On the pavement lay Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent gulping like half-spent fish. 
"There you are," gasped Ford, scrabbling for a fingerhold on the pavement as it raced through the Third Reach of the Unknown, "I told you I'd think of something." 
"Oh sure," said Arthur, "sure." 
"Bright idea of mine," said Ford, "to find a passing spaceship and get rescued by it." 
The real universe arched sickeningly away beneath them. Various pretend ones flitted silently by, like mountain goats. Primal light exploded, splattering space-time as with gobbets of junket. Time blossomed, matter shrank away. The highest prime number coalesced quietly in a corner and hid itself away for ever. 
"Oh come off it," said Arthur, "the chances against it were astronomical." 
"Don't knock it, it worked," said Ford. 
"What sort of ship are we in?" asked Arthur as the pit of eternity yawned beneath them. 
"I don't know," said Ford, "I haven't opened my eyes yet." 
"No, nor have I," said Arthur. 
The Universe jumped, froze, quivered and splayed out in several unexpected directions. 
Arthur and Ford opened their eyes and looked about in considerable surprise. 
"Good god," said Arthur, "it looks just like the sea front at Southend." 
"Hell, I'm relieved to hear you say that," said Ford. "Why?"â¨"Because I thought I must be going mad."â¨"Perhaps you are. Perhaps you only thought I said it." Ford thought about this. 
"Well, did you say it or didn't you?" he asked. 
"I think so," said Arthur. 
"Well, perhaps we're both going mad." 
"Yes," said Arthur, "we'd be mad, all things considered, to think this was Southend." 
"Well, do you think this is Southend?" "Oh yes."â¨"So do I."â¨"Therefore we must be mad." 
"Nice day for it." 
"Yes," said a passing maniac. 
"Who was that?" asked Arthur 
"Who the man with the five heads and the elderberry bush full of kippers?" 
"Yes."â¨"I don't know. Just someone." "Ah." 
They both sat on the pavement and watched with a certain unease as huge children bounced heavily along the sand and wild horses thundered through the sky taking fresh supplies of reinforced railings to the Uncertain Areas. 
"You know," said Arthur with a slight cough, "if this is Southend, there's something very odd about it..." 
"You mean the way the sea stays steady and the buildings keep washing up and down?" said Ford. "Yes I thought that was odd too. In fact," he continued as with a huge bang Southend split itself into six equal segments which danced and span giddily round each other in lewd and licentious formation, "there is something altogether very strange going on." 
Wild yowling noises of pipes and strings seared through the wind, hot doughnuts popped out of the road for ten pence each, horrid fish stormed out of the sky and Arthur and Ford decided to make a run for it. 
They plunged through heavy walls of sound, mountains of archaic thought, valleys of mood music, bad shoe sessions and footling bats and suddenly heard a girl's voice. 
It sounded quite a sensible voice, but it just said, "Two to the power of one hundred thousand to one against and falling," and that was all. 
Ford skidded down a beam of light and span round trying to find a source for the voice but could see nothing he could seriously believe in. 
"What was that voice?" shouted Arthur. 
"I don't know," yelled Ford, "I don't know. It sounded like a measurement of probability." 
"Probability? What do you mean?" 
"Probability. You know, like two to one, three to one, five to four against. It said two to the power of one hundred thousand to one against. That's pretty improbable you know." 
A million-gallon vat of custard upended itself over them without warning. 
"But what does it mean?" cried Arthur. 
"What, the custard?" 
"No, the measurement of probability!" 
"I don't know. I don't know at all. I think we're on some kind of spaceship." 
"I can only assume," said Arthur, "that this is not the first-class compartment." 
Bulges appeared in the fabric of space-time. Great ugly bulges. 
"Haaaauuurrgghhh..." said Arthur as he felt his body softening and bending in unusual directions. "Southend seems to be melting away... the stars are swirling... a dustbowl... my legs are drifting off into the sunset... my left arm's come off too." A frightening thought struck him: "Hell," he said, "how am I going to operate my digital watch now?" He wound his eyes desperately around in Ford's direction. 
"Ford," he said, "you're turning into a penguin. Stop it." 
Again came the voice. 
"Two to the power of seventy-five thousand to one against and falling." 
Ford waddled around his pond in a furious circle. 
"Hey, who are you," he quacked. "Where are you? What's going on and is there any way of stopping it?" 
"Please relax," said the voice pleasantly, like a stewardess in an airliner with only one wing and two engines one of which is on fire, "you are perfectly safe." 
"But that's not the point!" raged Ford. "The point is that I am now a perfectly save penguin, and my colleague here is rapidly running out of limbs!" 
"It's alright, I've got them back now," said Arthur. 
"Two to the power of fifty thousand to one against and falling," said the voice. 
"Admittedly," said Arthur, "they're longer than I usually like them, but..." 
"Isn't there anything," squawked Ford in avian fury, "you feel you ought to be telling us?" 
The voice cleared its throat. A giant petit four lolloped off into the distance. 
"Welcome," the voice said, "to the Starship Heart of Gold." 
The voice continued. 
"Please do not be alarmed," it said, "by anything you see or hear around you. You are bound to feel some initial ill effects as you have been rescued from certain death at an improbability level of two to the power of two hundred and seventy-six thousand to one against possibly much higher. We are now cruising at a level of two to the power of twenty-five thousand to one against and falling, and we will be restoring normality just as soon as we are sure what is normal anyway. Thank you. Two to the power of twenty thousand to one against and falling." 
The voice cut out.â¨Ford and Arthur were in a small luminous pink cubicle. Ford was wildly excited. 
"Arthur!" he said, "this is fantastic! We've been picked up by a ship powered by the Infinite Improbability Drive! This is incredible! I heard rumors about it before! They were all officially denied, but they must have done it! They've built the Improbability Drive! Arthur, this is... Arthur? What's happening?" 
Arthur had jammed himself against the door to the cubicle, trying to hold it closed, but it was ill fitting. Tiny furry little hands were squeezing themselves through the cracks, their fingers were inkstained; tiny voices chattered insanely. 
Arthur looked up. 
"Ford!" he said, "there's an infinite number of monkeys outside who want to talk to us about this script for Hamlet they've worked out." 
Chapter 10 
The Infinite Improbability Drive is a wonderful new method of crossing vast interstellar distances in a mere nothingth of a second, without all that tedious mucking about in hyperspace. 
It was discovered by a lucky chance, and then developed into a governable form of propulsion by the Galactic Government's research team on Damogran. 
This, briefly, is the story of its discovery. 
The principle of generating small amounts of finite improbability by simply hooking the logic circuits of a Bambleweeny 57 Sub-Meson Brain to an atomic vector plotter suspended in a strong Brownian Motion producer (say a nice hot cup of tea) were of course well understood and such generators were often used to break the ice at parties by making all the molecules in the hostess's undergarments leap simultaneously one foot to the left, in accordance with the Theory of Indeterminacy. 
Many respectable physicists said that they weren't going to stand for this partly because it was a debasement of science, but mostly because they didn't get invited to those sort of parties. 
Another thing they couldn't stand was the perpetual failure they encountered in trying to construct a machine which could generate the infinite improbability field needed to flip a spaceship across the mind-paralysing distances between the furthest stars, and in the end they grumpily announced that such a machine was virtually impossible. 
Then, one day, a student who had been left to sweep up the lab after a particularly unsuccessful party found himself reasoning this way: 
If, he thought to himself, such a machine is a virtual impossibility, then it must logically be a finite improbability. So all I have to do in order to make one is to work out exactly how improbable it is, feed 
that figure into the finite improbability generator, give it a fresh cup of really hot tea... and turn it on! 
He did this, and was rather startled to discover that he had managed to create the long sought after golden Infinite Improbability generator out of thin air. 
It startled him even more when just after he was awarded the Galactic Institute's Prize for Extreme Cleverness he got lynched by a rampaging mob of respectable physicists who had finally realized that the one thing they really couldn't stand was a smartass. 
Chapter 11 
The Improbability-proof control cabin of the Heart of Gold looked like a perfectly conventional spaceship except that it was perfectly clean because it was so new. Some of the control seats hadn't had the plastic wrapping taken off yet. The cabin was mostly white, oblong, and about the size of a smallish restaurant. In fact it wasn't perfectly oblong: the two long walls were raked round in a slight parallel curve, and all the angles and corners were contoured in excitingly chunky shapes. The truth of the matter is that it would have been a great deal simpler and more practical to build the cabin as an ordinary three- dimensional oblong rom, but then the designers would have got miserable. As it was the cabin looked excitingly purposeful, with large video screens ranged over the control and guidance system panels on the concave wall, and long banks of computers set into the convex wall. In one corner a robot sat humped, its gleaming brushed steel head hanging loosely between its gleaming brushed steel knees. It too was fairly new, but though it was beautifully constructed and polished it somehow looked as if the various parts of its more or less humanoid body didn't quite fit properly. In fact they fitted perfectly well, but something in its bearing suggested that they might have fitted better. 
Zaphod Beeblebrox paced nervously up and down the cabin, brushing his hands over pieces of gleaming equipment and giggling with excitement. 
Trillian sat hunched over a clump of instruments reading off figures. Her voice was carried round the Tannoy system of the whole ship. 
"Five to one against and falling..." she said, "four to one against and falling... three to one... two... one... probability factor of one to one... we have normality, I repeat we have normality." She turned her microphone off then turned it back on, with a slight smile and continued: "Anything you still can't cope with is therefore your own problem. Please relax. You will be sent for soon." 
Zaphod burst out in annoyance: "Who are they Trillian?" 
Trillian span her seat round to face him and shrugged. 
"Just a couple of guys we seem to have picked up in open space," she said. "Section ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha." 
"Yeah, well that's a very sweet thought Trillian," complained Zaphod, "but do you really think it's wise under the circumstances? I mean, here we are on the run and everything, we must have the police of half the Galaxy after us by now, and we stop to pick up hitchhikers. OK, so ten out of ten for style, but minus several million for good thinking, yeah?" 
He tapped irritably at a control panel. Trillian quietly moved his hand before he tapped anything important. Whatever Zaphod's qualities of mind might include dash, bravado, conceit he was mechanically inept and could easily blow the ship up with an extravagant gesture. Trillian had come to suspect that the main reason why he had had such a wild and successful life that he never really understood the significance of anything he did. 
"Zaphod," she said patiently, "they were floating unprotected in open space... you wouldn't want them to have died would you?" 
"Well, you know... no. Not as such, but..." 
"Not as such? Not die as such? But?" Trillian cocked her head on one side. 
"Well, maybe someone else might have picked them up later." 
"A second later and they would have been dead." 
"Yeah, so if you'd taken the trouble to think about the problem a bit longer it would have gone away." 
"You'd been happy to let them die?" 
"Well, you know, not happy as such, but..." 
"Anyway," said Trillian, turning back to the controls, "I didn't pick them up." 
"What do you mean? Who picked them up then?" "The ship did."â¨"Huh?"â¨"The ship did. All by itself." 
"Huh?"â¨"Whilst we were in Improbability Drive." "But that's incredible." 
"No Zaphod. Just very very improbable." 
"Er, yeah." 
"Look Zaphod," she said, patting his arm, "don't worry about the aliens. They're just a couple of guys I expect. I'll send the robot down to get them and bring them up here. Hey Marvin!" 
In the corner, the robot's head swung up sharply, but then wobbled about imperceptibly. It pulled itself up to its feet as if it was about five pounds heavier that it actually was, and made what an outside observer would have thought was a heroic effort to cross the room. It stopped in front of Trillian and seemed to stare through her left shoulder. 
"I think you ought to know I'm feeling very depressed," it said. Its voice was low and hopeless. 
"Oh God," muttered Zaphod and slumped into a seat. 
"Well," said Trillian in a bright compassionate tone, "here's something to occupy you and keep your mind off things." 
"It won't work," droned Marvin, "I have an exceptionally large mind." 
"Marvin!" warned Trillian. 
"Alright," said Marvin, "what do you want me to do?" 
"Go down to number two entry bay and bring the two aliens up here under surveillance." 
With a microsecond pause, and a finely calculated micromodulation of pitch and timbre nothing you could actually take offence at Marvin managed to convey his utter contempt and horror of all things human. 
"Just that?" he said. 
"Yes," said Trillian firmly. 
"I won't enjoy it," said Marvin. 
Zaphod leaped out of his seat. 
"She's not asking you to enjoy it," he shouted, "just do it will you?" 
"Alright," said Marvin like the tolling of a great cracked bell, "I'll do it." 
"Good..." snapped Zaphod, "great... thank you..." 
Marvin turned and lifted his flat-topped triangular red eyes up towards him. 
"I'm not getting you down at all am I?" he said pathetically. 
"No no Marvin," lilted Trillian, "that's just fine, really..." 
"I wouldn't like to think that I was getting you down." 
"No, don't worry about that," the lilt continued, "you just act as comes naturally and everything will be just fine." 
"You're sure you don't mind?" probed Marvin. 
"No no Marvin," lilted Trillian, "that's just fine, really... just part of life." 
"Marvin flashed him an electronic look. 
"Life," said Marvin, "don't talk to me about life." 
He turned hopelessly on his heel and lugged himself out of the cabin. With a satisfied hum and a click the door closed behind him 
"I don't think I can stand that robot much longer Zaphod," growled Trillian. 
The Encyclopaedia Galactica defines a robot as a mechanical apparatus designed to do the work of a man. The marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation defines a robot as "Your Plastic Pal Who's Fun To Be With." 
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy defines the marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation as "a bunch of mindless jerks who'll be the first against the wall when the revolution comes," with a footnote to the effect that the editors would welcome applications from anyone interested in taking over the post of robotics correspondent. 
Curiously enough, an edition of the Encyclopaedia Galactica that had the good fortune to fall through a time warp from a thousand years in the future defined the marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation as "a bunch of mindless jerks who were the first against the wall when the revolution came." 
The pink cubicle had winked out of existence, the monkeys had sunk away to a better dimension. Ford and Arthur found themselves in the embarkation area of the ship. It was rather smart. 
"I think the ship's brand new," said Ford. 
"How can you tell?" asked Arthur. "Have you got some exotic device for measuring the age of metal?" 
"No, I just found this sales brochure lying on the floor. It's a lot of 'the Universe can be yours' stuff. Ah! Look, I was right." 
Ford jabbed at one of the pages and showed it to Arthur. 
"It says: 'Sensational new breakthrough in Improbability Physics. As soon as the ship's drive reaches Infinite Improbability it passes through every point in the Universe. Be the envy of other major governments.' Wow, this is big league stuff." 
Ford hunted excitedly through the technical specs of the ship, occasionally gasping with astonishment at what he read clearly Galactic astrotechnology had moved ahead during the years of his exile. 
Arthur listened for a short while, but being unable to understand the vast majority of what Ford was saying he began to let his mind wander, trailing his fingers along the edge of an incomprehensible computer bank, he reached out and pressed an invitingly large red button on a nearby panel. The panel lit up with the words Please do not press this button again. He shook himself. 
"Listen," said Ford, who was still engrossed in the sales brochure, "they make a big thing of the ship's cybernetics. 'A new generation of Sirius Cybernetics Corporation robots and computers, with the new GPP feature.'" 
"GPP feature?" said Arthur. "What's that?" "Oh, it says Genuine People Personalities." "Oh," said Arthur, "sounds ghastly." 
A voice behind them said, "It is." The voice was low and hopeless and accompanied by a slight clanking sound. They span round and saw an abject steel man standing hunched in the doorway. 
"What?" they said. 
"Ghastly," continued Marvin, "it all is. Absolutely ghastly. Just don't even talk about it. Look at this door," he said, stepping through it. The irony circuits cut into his voice modulator as he mimicked the style of the sales brochure. "All the doors in this spaceship have a cheerful and sunny disposition. It is their pleasure to open for you, and their satisfaction to close again with the knowledge of a job well done." 
As the door closed behind them it became apparent that it did indeed have a satisfied sigh-like quality to it. "Hummmmmmmyummmmmmm ah!" it said. 
Marvin regarded it with cold loathing whilst his logic circuits chattered with disgust and tinkered with the concept of directing physical violence against it Further circuits cut in saying, Why bother? What's the point? Nothing is worth getting involved in. Further circuits amused themselves by analysing the molecular components of the door, and of the humanoids' brain cells. For a quick encore they measured the level of hydrogen emissions in the surrounding cubic parsec of space and then shut down again in boredom. A spasm of despair shook the robot's body as he turned. 
"Come on," he droned, "I've been ordered to take you down to the bridge. Here I am, brain the size of a planet and they ask me to take you down to the bridge. Call that job satisfaction? 'Cos I don't." 
He turned and walked back to the hated door. 
"Er, excuse me," said Ford following after him, "which government owns this ship?" 
Marvin ignored him. 
"You watch this door," he muttered, "it's about to open again. I can tell by the intolerable air of smugness it suddenly generates." 
With an ingratiating little whine the door slit open again and Marvin stomped through. 
"Come on," he said. 
The others followed quickly and the door slit back into place with pleased little clicks and whirrs. 
"Thank you the marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation," said Marvin and trudged desolately up the gleaming curved corridor that stretched out before them. "Let's build robots with Genuine People Personalities," they said. So they tried it out with me. I'm a personality prototype. You can tell can't you?" 
Ford and Arthur muttered embarrassed little disclaimers. 
"I hate that door," continued Marvin. "I'm not getting you down at all am I?" 
"Which government..." started Ford again.â¨"No government owns it," snapped the robot, "it's been stolen." 
"Stolen?"â¨"Stolen?" mimicked Marvin. "Who by?" asked Ford. "Zaphod Beeblebrox." 
Something extraordinary happened to Ford's face. At least five entirely separate and distinct expressions of shock and amazement piled up on it in a jumbled mess. His left leg, which was in mid stride, seemed to have difficulty in finding the floor again. He stared at the robot and tried to entangle some dartoid muscles. 
"Zaphod Beeblebrox...?" he said weakly. 
"Sorry, did I say something wrong?" said Marvin, dragging himself on regardless. "Pardon me for breathing, which I never do anyway so I don't know why I bother to say it, oh God I'm so depressed. Here's another of those self-satisfied door. Life! Don't talk to me about life." 
"No one ever mentioned it," muttered Arthur irritably. "Ford, are you alright?" 
Ford stared at him. "Did that robot say Zaphod Beeblebrox?" he said. 
Chapter 12 
A loud clatter of gunk music flooded through the Heart of Gold cabin as Zaphod searched the sub-etha radio wavebands for news of himself. The machine was rather difficult to operate. For years radios had been operated by means of pressing buttons and turning dials; then as the technology became more sophisticated the controls were made touch-sensitive-you merely had to brush the panels with your fingers; now all you had to do was wave your hand in the general direction of the components and hope. It saved a lot of muscular expenditure of course, but meant that you had to sit infuriatingly still if you wanted to keep listening to the same programme. 
Zaphod waved a hand and the channel switched again. More gunk music, but this time it was a background to a news announcement. The news was always heavily edited to fit the rhythms of the music. 
"... and news brought to you here on the sub-etha wave band, broadcasting around the galaxy around the clock," squawked a voice, "and we'll be saying a big hello to all intelligent life forms everywhere... and to everyone else out there, the secret is to bangâ¨the rocks together, guys. And of course, the big news story tonight is the sensational theft of the new Improbability Drive prototype ship by none other than Galactic President Zaphod Beeblebrox. And the question everyone's asking is... has the big Z finally flipped? Beeblebrox, the man who invented the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, ex-confidence trickster, once described by Eccentrica Gallumbits as the Best Bang since the Big One, and recently voted the Worstâ¨Dressed Sentinent Being in the Known Universe for the seventh time... has he got an answer this time? We asked his private brain care specialist Gag Halfrunt..." 
The music swirled and dived for a moment. Another voice broke in, presumably Halfrunt. He said: "Well, Zaphod's jist zis guy you know?" but got no further because an electric pencil flew across the cabin and through the radio's on/off sensitive airspace. Zaphod turned and glared at Trillian she had thrown the pencil. 
"Hey," he said, what do you do that for?" 
Trillian was tapping her fingers on a screenful of figures. 
"I've just thought of something," she said. 
"Yeah? Worth interrupting a news bulletin about me for?" 
"You hear enough about yourself as it is." 
"I'm very insecure. We know that." 
"Can we drop your ego for a moment? This is important." 
"If there's anything more important than my ego around, I want it caught and shot now." Zaphod glared at her again, then laughed. 
"Listen," she said, "we picked up those couple of guys..." "What couple of guys?"â¨"The couple of guys we picked up."â¨"Oh, yeah," said Zaphod, "those couple of guys." 
"We picked them up in sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha."â¨"Yeah?" said Zaphod and blinked.â¨Trillian said quietly, "Does that mean anything to you?" "Mmmmm," said Zaphod, "ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha. ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha?" "Well?" said Trillian. 
"Er... what does the Z mean?" said Zaphod. "Which one?"â¨"Any one." 
One of the major difficulties Trillian experienced in her relationship with Zaphod was learning to distinguish between him pretending to be stupid just to get people off their guard, pretending to be stupid because he couldn't be bothered to think and wanted someone else to do it for him, pretending to be outrageously stupid to hide the fact that he actually didn't understand what was going on, and really being genuinely stupid. He was renowned for being amazingly clever and quite clearly was so but not all the time, which obviously worried him, hence the act. He proffered people to be puzzled rather than contemptuous. This above all appeared to Trillian to be genuinely stupid, but she could no longer be bothered to argue about it. 
She sighed and punched up a star map on the visiscreen so she could make it simple for him, whatever his reasons for wanting it to be that way. 
"There," she pointed, "right there." "Hey... Yeah!" said Zaphod. "Well?" she said.â¨"Well what?" 
Parts of the inside of her head screamed at other parts of the inside of her head. She said, very calmly, "It's the same sector you originally picked me up in." 
He looked at her and then looked back at the screen. 
"Hey, yeah," he said, "now that is wild. We should have zapped straight into the middle of the Horsehead Nebula. How did we come to be there? I mean that's nowhere." 
She ignored this. 
"Improbability Drive," she said patiently. "You explained it to me yourself. We pass through every point in the Universe, you know that." 
"Yeah, but that's one wild coincidence isn't it?" 
"Yes." 
"Picking someone up at that point? Out of the whole of the Universe to choose from? That's just too... I want to work this out. Computer!" 
The Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Shipboard Computer which controlled and permeated every particle of the ship switched into communication mode. 
"Hi there!" it said brightly and simultaneously spewed out a tiny ribbon of ticker tape just for the record. The ticker tape said, Hi there! 
"Oh God," said Zaphod. He hadn't worked with this computer for long but had already learned to loathe it. 
The computer continued, brash and cheery as if it was selling detergent. 
"I want you to know that whatever your problem, I am here to help you solve it." 
"Yeah yeah," said Zaphod. "Look, I think I'll just use a piece of paper." 
"Sure thing," said the computer, spilling out its message into a waste bin at the same time, "I understand. If you ever want..." 
"Shut up!" said Zaphod, and snatching up a pencil sat down next to Trillian at the console. 
"OK, OK..." said the computer in a hurt tone of voice and closed down its speech channel again. 
Zaphod and Trillian pored over the figures that the Improbability flight path scanner flashed silently up in front of them. 
"Can we work out," said Zaphod, "from their point of view what the Improbability of their rescue was?" 
"Yes, that's a constant", said Trillian, "two to the power of two hundred and seventy-six thousand seven hundred and nine to one against." 
"That's high. They're two lucky lucky guys." 
"Yes." 
"But relative to what we were doing when the ship picked them up..." 
Trillian punched up the figures. They showed two-to-the power-of- Infinity-minus-one (an irrational number that only has a conventional meaning in Improbability physics). 
"... it's pretty low," continued Zaphod with a slight whistle. 
"Yes," agreed Trillian, and looked at him quizzically. 
"That's one big whack of Improbability to be accounted for. Something pretty improbable has got to show up on the balance sheet if it's all going to add up into a pretty sum." 
Zaphod scribbled a few sums, crossed them out and threw the pencil away. 
"Bat's dots, I can't work it out." 
"Well?" 
Zaphod knocked his two heads together in irritation and gritted his teeth. 
"OK," he said. "Computer!" 
The voice circuits sprang to life again. 
"Why hello there!" they said (ticker tape, ticker tape). "All I want to do is make your day nicer and nicer and nicer..." 
"Yeah well shut up and work something out for me." 
"Sure thing," chattered the computer, "you want a probability forecast based on..." 
"Improbability data, yeah." 
"OK," the computer continued. "Here's an interesting little notion. Did you realize that most people's lives are governed by telephone numbers?" 
A pained look crawled across one of Zaphod's faces and on to the other one. 
"Have you flipped?" he said. 
"No, but you will when I tell you that..." 
Trillian gasped. She scrabbled at the buttons on the Improbability flight path screen. 
"Telephone number?" she said. "Did that thing say telephone number?" 
Numbers flashed up on the screen.â¨The computer had paused politely, but now it continued. "What I was about to say was that..."â¨"Don't bother please," said Trillian.â¨"Look, what is this?" said Zaphod. 
"I don't know," said Trillian, "but those aliens they're on the way up to the bridge with that wretched robot. Can we pick them up on any monitor cameras?" 
Chapter 13 
Marvin trudged on down the corridor, still moaning. 
"... and then of course I've got this terrible pain in all the diodes down my left hand side..." 
"No?" said Arthur grimly as he walked along beside him. "Really?" 
"Oh yes," said Marvin, "I mean I've asked for them to be replaced but no one ever listens." 
"I can imagine." 
Vague whistling and humming noises were coming from Ford. "Well well well," he kept saying to himself, "Zaphod Beeblebrox..." 
Suddenly Marvin stopped, and held up a hand. "You know what's happened now of course?"â¨"No, what?" said Arthur, who didn't what to know. "We've arrived at another of those doors." 
There was a sliding door let into the side of the corridor. Marvin eyed it suspiciously. 
"Well?" said Ford impatiently. "Do we go through?" 
"Do we go through?" mimicked Marvin. "Yes. This is the entrance to the bridge. I was told to take you to the bridge. Probably the highest demand that will be made on my intellectual capacities today I shouldn't wonder." 
Slowly, with great loathing, he stepped towards the door, like a hunter stalking his prey. Suddenly it slid open. 
"Thank you," it said, "for making a simple door very happy." 
Deep in Marvin's thorax gears ground. 
"Funny," he intoned funerally, "how just when you think life can't possibly get any worse it suddenly does." 
He heaved himself through the door and left Ford and Arthur staring at each other and shrugging their shoulders. From inside they heard Marvin's voice again. 
"I suppose you want to see the aliens now," he said. "Do you want me to sit in a corner and rust, or just fall apart where I'm standing?" 
"Yeah, just show them in would you Marvin?" came another voice. Arthur looked at Ford and was astonished to see him laughing. "What's...?"â¨"Shhh," said Ford, "come in." 
He stepped through into the bridge. 
Arthur followed him in nervously and was astonished to see a man lolling back in a chair with his feet on a control console picking the teeth in his right-hand head with his left hand. The right-hand head seemed to be thoroughly preoccupied with this task, but the left-hand one was grinning a broad, relaxed, nonchalant grin. The number of things that Arthur couldn't believe he was seeing was fairly large. His jaw flapped about at a loose end for a while. 
The peculiar man waved a lazy wave at Ford and with an appalling affectation of nonchalance said, "Ford, hi, how are you? Glad you could drop in." 
Ford was not going to be outcooled. 
"Zaphod," he drawled, "great to see you, you're looking well, the extra arm suits you. Nice ship you've stolen." 
Arthur goggled at him. 
"You mean you know this guy?" he said, waving a wild finger at Zaphod. 
"Know him!" exclaimed Ford, "he's..." he paused, and decided to do the introductions the other way round. 
"Oh, Zaphod, this is a friend of mine, Arthur Dent," he said, "I saved him when his planet blew up." 
"Oh sure," said Zaphod, "hi Arthur, glad you could make it." His right-hand head looked round casually, said "hi" and went back to having his teeth picked. 
Ford carried on. "And Arthur," he said, "this is my semi-cousin Zaphod Beeb..." 
"We've met," said Arthur sharply. 
When you're cruising down the road in the fast lane and you lazily sail past a few hard driving cars and are feeling pretty pleased with yourself and then accidentally change down from fourth to first 
instead of third thus making your engine leap out of your bonnet in a rather ugly mess, it tends to throw you off your stride in much the same way that this remark threw Ford Prefect off his. 
"Err... what?" 
"I said we've met." 
Zaphod gave an awkward start of surprise and jabbed a gum sharply. 
"Hey... er, have we? Hey... er..." 
Ford rounded on Arthur with an angry flash in his eyes. Now he felt he was back on home ground he suddenly began to resent having lumbered himself with this ignorant primitive who knew as much about the affairs of the Galaxy as an Ilford-based gnat knew about life in Peking. 
"What do you mean you've met?" he demanded. "This is Zaphod Beeblebrox from Betelgeuse Five you know, not bloody Martin Smith from Croydon." 
"I don't care," said Arthur coldly. We've met, haven't we Zaphod Beeblebrox or should I say... Phil?" 
"What!" shouted Ford. 
"You'll have to remind me," said Zaphod. "I've a terrible memory for species." 
"It was at a party," pursued Arthur. 
"Yeah, well I doubt that," said Zaphod. 
"Cool it will you Arthur!" demanded Ford. 
Arthur would not be deterred. "A party six months ago. On Earth... England..." 
Zaphod shook his head with a tight-lipped smile. "London," insisted Arthur, "Islington."â¨"Oh," said Zaphod with a guilty start, "that party." 
This wasn't fair on Ford at all. He looked backwards and forwards between Arthur and Zaphod. "What?" he said to Zaphod. "You don't mean to say you've been on that miserable planet as well do you?" 
"No, of course not," said Zaphod breezily. "Well, I may have just dropped in briefly, you know, on my way somewhere..." 
"But I was stuck there for fifteen years!" "Well I didn't know that did I?" 
"But what were you doing there?" 
"Looking about, you know." 
"He gatecrashed a party," persisted Arthur, trembling with anger, "a fancy dress party..." 
"It would have to be, wouldn't it?" said Ford. 
"At this party," persisted Arthur, "was a girl... oh well, look it doesn't matter now. The whole place has gone up in smoke anyway..." 
"I wish you'd stop sulking about that bloody planet," said Ford. "Who was the lady?" 
"Oh just somebody. Well alright, I wasn't doing very well with her. I'd been trying all evening. Hell, she was something though. Beautiful, charming, devastatingly intelligent, at last I'd got her to myself for a bit and was plying her with a bit of talk when this friend of yours barges up and says Hey doll, is this guy boring you? Why don't you talk to me instead? I'm from a different planet." I never saw her again." 
"Zaphod?" exclaimed Ford. 
"Yes," said Arthur, glaring at him and trying not to feel foolish. "He only had the two arms and the one head and he called himself Phil, but..." 
"But you must admit he did turn out to be from another planet," said Trillian wandering into sight at the other end of the bridge. She gave Arthur a pleasant smile which settled on him like a ton of bricks and then turned her attention to the ship's controls again. 
There was silence for a few seconds, and then out of the scrambled mess of Arthur's brain crawled some words. 
"Tricia McMillian?" he said. "What are you doing here?" 
"Same as you," she said, "I hitched a lift. After all with a degree in Maths and another in astrophysics what else was there to do? It was either that or the dole queue again on Monday." 
"Infinity minus one," chattered the computer, "Improbability sum now complete." 
Zaphod looked about him, at Ford, at Arthur, and then at Trillian. 
"Trillian," he said, "is this sort of thing going to happen every time we use the Improbability drive?" 
"Very probably, I'm afraid," she said. 
Chapter 14 
The Heart of Gold fled on silently through the night of space, now on conventional photon drive. Its crew of four were ill at ease knowing that they had been brought together not of their own volition or by simple coincidence, but by some curious principle of physics as if relationships between people were susceptible to the same laws that governed the relationships between atoms and molecules. 
As the ship's artificial night closed in they were each grateful to retire to separate cabins and try to rationalize their thoughts. 
Trillian couldn't sleep. She sat on a couch and stared at a small cage which contained her last and only links with Earth two white mice that she had insisted Zaphod let her bring. She had expected not to see the planet again, but she was disturbed by her negative reaction to the planet's destruction. It seemed remote and unreal and she could find no thoughts to think about it. She watched the mice scurrying round the cage and running furiously in their little plastic treadwheels till they occupied her whole attention. Suddenly she shook herself and went back to the bridge to watch over the tiny flashing lights and figures that charted the ship's progress through the void. She wished she knew what it was she was trying not to think about. 
Zaphod couldn't sleep. He also wished he knew what it was that he wouldn't let himself think about. For as long as he could remember he'd suffered from a vague nagging feeling of being not all there. Most of the time he was able to put this thought aside and not worry about it, but it had been re-awakened by the sudden inexplicable arrival of Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent. Somehow it seemed to conform to a pattern that he couldn't see. 
Ford couldn't sleep. He was too excited about being back on the road again. Fifteen years of virtual imprisonment were over, just as he was finally beginning to give up hope. Knocking about with Zaphod for a bit promised to be a lot of fun, though there seemed to be 
something faintly odd about his semi-cousin that he couldn't put his finger on. The fact that he had become President of the Galaxy was frankly astonishing, as was the manner of his leaving the post. Was there a reason behind it? There would be no point in asking Zaphod, he never appeared to have a reason for anything he did at all: he had turned unfathomably into an art form. He attacked everything in life with a mixture of extraordinary genius and naive incompetence and it was often difficult to tell which was which. 
Arthur slept: he was terribly tired. 
There was a tap at Zaphod's door. It slid open. "Zaphod...?"â¨"Yeah?"â¨"I think we just found what you came to look for." "Hey, yeah?" 
Ford gave up the attempt to sleep. In the corner of his cabin was a small computer screen and keyboard. He sat at it for a while and tried to compose a new entry for the Guide on the subject of Vogons but couldn't think of anything vitriolic enough so he gave that up too, wrapped a robe round himself and went for a walk to the bridge. 
As he entered he was surprised to see two figures hunched excitedly over the instruments. 
"See? The ship's about to move into orbit," Trillian was saying. "There's a planet out there. It's at the exact coordinates you predicted." 
Zaphod heard a noise and looked up. 
"Ford!" he hissed. "Hey, come and take a look at this." 
Ford went and had a look at it. It was a series of figures flashing over a screen. 
"You recognize those Galactic coordinates?" said Zaphod. 
"No." 
"I'll give you a clue. Computer!" 
"Hi gang!" enthused the computer. "This is getting real sociable isn't it?" 
"Shut up," said Zaphod, "and show up the screens." 
Light on the bridge sank. Pinpoints of light played across the consoles and reflected in four pairs of eyes that stared up at the external monitor screens. 
There was absolutely nothing on them. "Recognize that?" whispered Zaphod. Ford frowned.â¨"Er, no," he said. 
"What do you see?" 
"Nothing." 
"Recognize it?" 
"What are you talking about?" 
"We're in the Horsehead Nebula. One whole vast dark cloud." 
"And I was meant to recognize that from a blank screen?" 
"Inside a dark nebula is the only place in the Galaxy you'd see a dark screen." 
"Very good." 
Zaphod laughed. He was clearly very excited about something, almost childishly so. 
"Hey, this is really terrific, this is just far too much!" 
"What's so great about being stuck in a dust cloud?" said Ford. 
"What would you reckon to find here?" urged Zaphod. 
"Nothing." 
"No stars? No planets?" 
"No." 
"Computer!" shouted Zaphod, "rotate angle of vision through one- eighty degrees and don't talk about it!" 
For a moment it seemed that nothing was happening, then a brightness glowed at the edge of the huge screen. A red star the size of a small plate crept across it followed quickly by another one a binary system. Then a vast crescent sliced into the corner of the picture a red glare shading away into the deep black, the night side of the planet. 
"I've found it!" cried Zaphod, thumping the console. "I've found it!" Ford stared at it in astonishment.â¨"What is it?" he said. 
"That..." said Zaphod, "is the most improbable planet that ever existed." 
Chapter 15 
(Excerpt from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Page 634784, Section 5a, Entry: Magrathea) 
Far back in the mists of ancient time, in the great and glorious days of the former Galactic Empire, life was wild, rich and largely tax free. 
Mighty starships plied their way between exotic suns, seeking adventure and reward amongst the furthest reaches of Galactic space. In those days spirits were brave, the stakes were high, men were real men, women were real women, and small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri were real small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri. And all dared to brave unknown terrors, to do mighty deeds, to boldly split infinitives that no man had split before and thus was the Empire forged. 
Many men of course became extremely rich, but this was perfectly natural and nothing to be ashamed of because no one was really poor at least no one worth speaking of. And for all the richest and most successful merchants life inevitably became rather dull and niggly, and they began to imagine that this was therefore the fault of the worlds they'd settled on none of them was entirely satisfactory: either the climate wasn't quite right in the later part of the afternoon, or the day was half an hour too long, or the sea was exactly the wrong shade of pink. 
And thus were created the conditions for a staggering new form of specialist industry: custom-made luxury planet building. The home of this industry was the planet Magrathea, where hyperspatial engineers sucked matter through white holes in space to form it into dream planets gold planets, platinum planets, soft rubber planets with lots of earthquakes all lovingly made to meet the exacting standards that the Galaxy's richest men naturally came to expect. 
But so successful was this venture that Magrathea itself soon became the richest planet of all time and the rest of the Galaxy was reduced to abject poverty. And so the system broke down, the Empire 
collapsed, and a long sullen silence settled over a billion worlds, disturbed only by the pen scratchings of scholars as they laboured into the night over smug little treaties on the value of a planned political economy. 
Magrathea itself disappeared and its memory soon passed into the obscurity of legend. 
In these enlightened days of course, no one believes a word of it. 
Chapter 16 
Arthur awoke to the sound of argument and went to the bridge. Ford was waving his arms about. 
"You're crazy, Zaphod," he was saying, "Magrathea is a myth, a fairy story, it's what parents tell their kids about at night if they want them to grow up to become economists, it's..." 
"And that's what we are currently in orbit around," insisted Zaphod. 
"Look, I can't help what you may personally be in orbit around," said Ford, "but this ship..." 
"Computer!" shouted Zaphod. 
"Oh no..." 
"Hi there! This is Eddie your shipboard computer, and I'm feeling just great guys, and I know I'm just going to get a bundle of kicks out of any programme you care to run through me." 
Arthur looked inquiringly at Trillian. She motioned him to come on in but keep quiet. 
"Computer," said Zaphod, "tell us again what our present trajectory is." 
"A real pleasure feller," it burbled, "we are currently in orbit at an altitude of three hundred miles around the legendary planet of Magrathea." 
"Proving nothing," said Ford. "I wouldn't trust that computer to speak my weight." 
"I can do that for you, sure," enthused the computer, punching out more tickertape. "I can even work out you personality problems to ten decimal places if it will help." 
Trillian interrupted. 
"Zaphod," she said, "any minute now we will be swinging round to the daylight side of this planet," adding, "whatever it turns out to be." 
"Hey, what do you mean by that? The planet's where I predicted it would be isn't it?" 
"Yes, I know there's a planet there. I'm not arguing with anyone, it's just that I wouldn't know Magrathea from any other lump of cold rock. Dawn's coming up if you want it." 
"OK, OK," muttered Zaphod, "let's at least give our eyes a good time. Computer!" 
"Hi there! What can I..." 
"Just shut up and give us a view of the planet again." 
A dark featureless mass once more filled the screens the planet rolling away beneath them. 
They watched for a moment in silence, but Zaphod was fidgety with excitement. 
"We are now traversing the night side..." he said in a hushed voice. The planet rolled on. 
"The surface of the planet is now three hundred miles beneath us..." he continued. He was trying to restore a sense of occasion to what he felt should have been a great moment. Magrathea! He was piqued by Ford's sceptical reaction. Magrathea! 
"In a few seconds," he continued, "we should see... there!" 
The moment carried itself. Even the most seasoned star tramp can't help but shiver at the spectacular drama of a sunrise seen from space, but a binary sunrise is one of the marvels of the Galaxy. 
Out of the utter blackness stabbed a sudden point of blinding light. It crept up by slight degrees and spread sideways in a thin crescent blade, and within seconds two suns were visible, furnaces of light, searing the black edge of the horizon with white fire. Fierce shafts of colour streaked through the thin atmosphere beneath them. 
"The fires of dawn...!" breathed Zaphod. "The twin suns of Soulianis and Rahm...!" 
"Or whatever," said Ford quietly. 
"Soulianis and Rahm!" insisted Zaphod. 
The suns blazed into the pitch of space and a low ghostly music floated through the bridge: Marvin was humming ironically because he hated humans so much. 
As Ford gazed at the spectacle of light before them excitement burnt inside him, but only the excitement of seeing a strange new planet, it was enough for him to see it as it was. It faintly irritated him 
that Zaphod had to impose some ludicrous fantasy on to the scene to make it work for him. All this Magrathea nonsense seemed juvenile. Isn't it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it too? 
All this Magrathea business seemed totally incomprehensible to Arthur. He edged up to Trillian and asked her what was going on. 
"I only know what Zaphod's told me," she whispered. "Apparently Magrathea is some kind of legend from way back which no one seriously believes in. Bit like Atlantis on Earth, except that the legends say the Magratheans used to manufacture planets." 
Arthur blinked at the screens and felt he was missing something important. Suddenly he realized what it was. 
"Is there any tea on this spaceship?" he asked. 
More of the planet was unfolding beneath them as the Heart of Gold streaked along its orbital path. The suns now stood high in the black sky, the pyrotechnics of dawn were over, and the surface of the planet appeared bleak and forbidding in the common light of day grey, dusty and only dimly contoured. It looked dead and cold as a crypt. From time to time promising features would appear on the distant horizon ravines, maybe mountains, maybe even cities but as they approached the lines would soften and blur into anonymity and nothing would transpire. The planet's surface was blurred by time, by the slow movement of the thin stagnant air that had crept across it for century upon century. 
Clearly, it was very very old. 
A moment of doubt came to Ford as he watched the grey landscape move beneath them. The immensity of time worried him, he could feel it as a presence. He cleared his throat. 
"Well, even supposing it is..." 
"It is," said Zaphod. 
"Which it isn't," continued Ford. "What do you want with it anyway? There's nothing there." 
"Not on the surface," said Zaphod. 
"Alright, just supposing there's something. I take it you're not here for the sheer industrial archaeology of it all. What are you after?" 
One of Zaphod's heads looked away. The other one looked round to see what the first was looking at, but it wasn't looking at anything very much. 
"Well," said Zaphod airily, "it's partly the curiosity, partly a sense of adventure, but mostly I think it's the fame and the money..." 
Ford glanced at him sharply. He got a very strong impression that Zaphod hadn't the faintest idea why he was there at all. 
"You know I don't like the look of that planet at all," said Trillian shivering. 
"Ah, take no notice," said Zaphod, "with half the wealth of the former Galactic Empire stored on it somewhere it can afford to look frumpy." 
Bullshit, thought Ford. Even supposing this was the home of some ancient civilization now gone to dust, even supposing a number of exceedingly unlikely things, there was no way that vast treasures of wealth were going to be stored there in any form that would still have meaning now. He shrugged. 
"I think it's just a dead planet," he said.â¨"The suspense is killing me," said Arthur testily. 
Stress and nervous tension are now serious social problems in all parts of the Galaxy, and it is in order that this situation should not in any way be exacerbated that the following facts will now be revealed in advance. 
The planet in question is in fact the legendary Magrathea. 
The deadly missile attack shortly to be launched by an ancient automatic defence system will result merely in the breakage of three coffee cups and a micecage, the bruising of somebody's upper arm, and the untimely creation and sudden demise of a bowl of petunias and an innocent sperm whale. 
In order that some sense of mystery should still be preserved, no revelation will yet be made concerning whose upper arm sustained the bruise. This fact may safely be made the subject of suspense since it is of no significance whatsoever. 
Chapter 17 
After a fairly shaky start to the day, Arthur's mind was beginning to reassemble itself from the shellshocked fragments the previous day had left him with. He had found a Nutri-Matic machine which had provided him with a plastic cup filled with a liquid that was almost,â¨but not quite, entirely unlike tea. The way it functioned was very interesting. When the Drink button was pressed it made an instantâ¨but highly detailed examination of the subject's taste buds, a spectroscopic analysis of the subject's metabolism and then sent tiny experimental signals down the neural pathways to the taste centresâ¨of the subject's brain to see what was likely to go down well. However, no one knew quite why it did this because it invariably delivered a cupful of liquid that was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea. The Nutri-Matic was designed and manufactured by the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation whose complaints department now covers all the major land masses of the first three planets in the Sirius Tau Star system. 
Arthur drank the liquid and found it reviving. He glanced up at the screens again and watched a few more hundred miles of barren greyness slide past. It suddenly occurred to him to ask a question which had been bothering him. 
"Is it safe?" he said. 
"Magrathea's been dead for five million years," said Zaphod, "of course it's safe. Even the ghosts will have settled down and raised families by now." At which point a strange and inexplicable sound thrilled suddenly through the bridge a noise as of a distant fanfare; a hollow, reedy, insubstantial sound. It preceded a voice that was equally hollow, reedy and insubstantial. The voice said "Greetings to you..." 
Someone from the dead planet was talking to them. "Computer!" shouted Zaphod.â¨"Hi there!"â¨"What the photon is it?" 
"Oh, just some five-million-year-old tape that's being broadcast at us." 
"A what? A recording?" 
"Shush!" said Ford. "It's carrying on." 
The voice was old, courteous, almost charming, but was underscored with quite unmistakable menace. 
"This is a recorded announcement," it said, "as I'm afraid we're all out at the moment. The commercial council of Magrathea thanks you for your esteemed visit..." 
("A voice from ancient Magrathea!" shouted Zaphod. "OK, OK," said Ford.) 
"... but regrets," continued the voice, "that the entire planet is temporarily closed for business. Thank you. If you would care to leave your name and the address of a planet where you can be contacted, kindly speak when you hear the tone." 
A short buzz followed, then silence. 
"They want to get rid of us," said Trillian nervously. "What do we do?" 
"It's just a recording," said Zaphod. "We keep going. Got that, computer?" 
"I got it," said the computer and gave the ship an extra kick of speed. 
They waited. 
After a second or so came the fanfare once again, and then the voice. 
"We would like to assure you that as soon as our business is resumed announcements will be made in all fashionable magazines and colour supplements, when our clients will once again be able to select from all that's best in contemporary geography." The menace in the voice took on a sharper edge. "Meanwhile we thank our clients for their kind interest and would ask them to leave. Now." 
Arthur looked round the nervous faces of his companions. 
"Well, I suppose we'd better be going then, hadn't we?" he suggested. 
"Shhh!" said Zaphod. "There's absolutely nothing to be worried about." 
"Then why's everyone so tense?" 
"They're just interested!" shouted Zaphod. "Computer, start a descent into the atmosphere and prepare for landing." 
This time the fanfare was quite perfunctory, the voice distinctly cold. 
"It is most gratifying," it said, "that your enthusiasm for our planet continues unabated, and so we would like to assure you that the guided missiles currently converging with your ship are part of a special service we extend to all of our most enthusiastic clients, and the fully armed nuclear warheads are of course merely a courtesy detail. We look forward to your custom in future lives... thank you." 
The voice snapped off. "Oh," said Trillian. "Er..." said Arthur. "Well?" said Ford. 
"Look," said Zaphod, "will you get it into your heads? That's just a recorded message. It's millions of years old. It doesn't apply to us, get it?" 
"What," said Trillian quietly, "about the missiles?" 
"Missiles? Don't make me laugh." 
Ford tapped Zaphod on the shoulder and pointed at the rear screen. Clear in the distance behind them two silver darts were climbing through the atmosphere towards the ship. A quick change of magnification brought them into close focus two massively real rockets thundering through the sky. The suddenness of it was shocking. 
"I think they're going to have a very good try at applying to us," said Ford. 
Zaphod stared at them in astonishment. 
"Hey this is terrific!" he said. "Someone down there is trying to kill us!" 
"Terrific," said Arthur.â¨"But don't you see what this means?" "Yes. We're going to die."â¨"Yes, but apart from that."â¨"Apart from that?" 
"It means we must be on to something!" 
"How soon can we get off it?" 
Second by second the image of the missiles on the screen became larger. They had swung round now on to a direct homing course so that all that could be seen of them now was the warheads, head on. 
"As a matter of interest," said Trillian, "what are we going to do?" "Just keep cool," said Zaphod.â¨"Is that all?" shouted Arthur. 
"No, we're also going to... er... take evasive action!" said Zaphod with a sudden access of panic. "Computer, what evasive action can we take?" 
"Er, none I'm afraid, guys," said the computer. 
"... or something," said Zaphod, "... er..." he said. 
"There seems to be something jamming my guidance system," explained the computer brightly, "impact minus forty-five seconds. Please call me Eddie if it will help you to relax." 
Zaphod tried to run in several equally decisive directions simultaneously. "Right!" he said. "Er... we've got to get manual control of this ship." 
"Can you fly her?" asked Ford pleasantly. "No, can you?"â¨"No."â¨"Trillian, can you?" 
"No." 
"Fine," said Zaphod, relaxing. "We'll do it together." 
"I can't either," said Arthur, who felt it was time he began to assert himself. 
"I'd guessed that," said Zaphod. "OK computer, I want full manual control now." 
"You got it," said the computer. 
Several large desk panels slid open and banks of control consoles sprang up out of them, showering the crew with bits of expanded polystyrene packaging and balls of rolled-up cellophane: these controls had never been used before. 
Zaphod stared at them wildly. 
"OK, Ford," he said, "full retro thrust and ten degrees starboard. Or something..." 
"Good luck guys," chirped the computer, "impact minus thirty seconds..." 
Ford leapt to the controls only a few of them made any immediate sense to him so he pulled those. The ship shook and screamed as its guidance rocked jets tried to push it every which way simultaneously. He released half of them and the ship span round in a tight arc and headed back the way it had come, straight towards the oncoming missiles. 
Air cushions ballooned out of the walls in an instant as everyone was thrown against them. For a few seconds the inertial forces held them flattened and squirming for breath, unable to move. Zaphod struggled and pushed in manic desperation and finally managed a savage kick at a small lever that formed part of the guidance system. 
The lever snapped off. The ship twisted sharply and rocketed upwards. The crew were hurled violently back across the cabin. Ford's copy of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy smashed into another section of the control console with the combined result that the Guide started to explain to anyone who cared to listen about the best ways of smuggling Antarean parakeet glands out of Antares (an Antarean parakeet gland stuck on a small stick is a revolting but much sought after cocktail delicacy and very large sums of money are often paid for them by very rich idiots who want to impress other very rich idiots), and the ship suddenly dropped out of the sky like a stone. 
It was of course more or less at this moment that one of the crew sustained a nasty bruise to the upper arm. This should be emphasized because, as had already been revealed, they escape otherwise completely unharmed and the deadly nuclear missiles do not eventually hit the ship. The safety of the crew is absolutely assured. 
"Impact minus twenty seconds, guys..." said the computer. 
"Then turn the bloody engines back on!" bawled Zaphod. 
"OK, sure thing, guys," said the computer. With a subtle roar the engines cut back in, the ship smoothly flattened out of its dive and headed back towards the missiles again. 
The computer started to sing. 
"When you walk through the storm..." it whined nasally, "hold your head up high..." 
Zaphod screamed at it to shut up, but his voice was lost in the din of what they quite naturally assumed was approaching destruction. 
"And don't... be afraid... of the dark!" Eddie wailed. 
The ship, in flattening out had in fact flattened out upside down and lying on the ceiling as they were it was now totally impossible for any of the crew to reach the guidance systems. 
"At the end of the storm..." crooned Eddie. 
The two missiles loomed massively on the screens as they thundered towards the ship. 
"... is a golden sky..." 
But by an extraordinarily lucky chance they had not yet fully corrected their flight paths to that of the erratically weaving ship, and they passed right under it. 
"And the sweet silver songs of the lark... Revised impact time fifteen seconds fellas... Walk on through the wind..." 
The missiles banked round in a screeching arc and plunged back into pursuit. 
"This is it," said Arthur watching them. "We are now quite definitely going to die aren't we?" 
"I wish you'd stop saying that," shouted Ford. "Well we are aren't we?"â¨"Yes."â¨"Walk on through the rain..." sang Eddie. 
A thought struck Arthur. He struggled to his feet. 
"Why doesn't anyone turn on this Improbability Drive thing?" he said. "We could probably reach that." 
"What are you crazy?" said Zaphod. "Without proper programming anything could happen." 
"Does that matter at this stage?" shouted Arthur. 
"Though your dreams be tossed and blown..." sand Eddie. 
Arthur scrambled up on to one end of the excitingly chunky pieces of moulded contouring where the curve of the wall met the ceiling. 
"Walk on, walk on, with hope in your heart..." 
"Does anyone know why Arthur can't turn on the Improbability Drive?" shouted Trillian. 
"And you'll never walk alone... Impact minus five seconds, it's been great knowing you guys, God bless... You'll ne... ver... walk... alone!" 
"I said," yelled Trillian, "does anyone know..." 
The next thing that happened was a mid-mangling explosion of noise and light. 
Chapter 18 
And the next thing that happened after that was that the Heart of Gold continued on its way perfectly normally with a rather fetchingly redesigned interior. It was somewhat larger, and done out in delicate pastel shades of green and blue. In the centre a spiral staircase, leading nowhere in particular, stood in a spray of ferns and yellow flowers and next to it a stone sundial pedestal housed the main computer terminal. Cunningly deployed lighting and mirrors created the illusion of standing in a conservatory overlooking a wide stretch of exquisitely manicured garden. Around the periphery of the conservatory area stood marble-topped tables on intricately beautiful wrought-iron legs. As you gazed into the polished surface of the marble the vague forms of instruments became visible, and as you touched them the instruments materialized instantly under your hands. Looked at from the correct angles the mirrors appeared to reflect all the required data readouts, though it was far from clear where they were reflected from. It was in fact sensationally beautiful. 
Relaxing in a wickerwork sun chair, Zaphod Beeblebrox said, "What the hell happened?" 
"Well I was just saying," said Arthur lounging by a small fish pool, "there's this Improbability Drive switch over here..." he waved at where it had been. There was a potted plant there now. 
"But where are we?" said Ford who was sitting on the spiral staircase, a nicely chilled Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster in his hand. 
"Exactly where we were, I think..." said Trillian, as all about them the mirrors showed them an image of the blighted landscape of Magrathea which still scooted along beneath them. 
Zaphod leapt out of his seat.â¨"Then what's happened to the missiles?" he said.â¨A new and astounding image appeared in the mirrors. 
"They would appear," said Ford doubtfully, "to have turned into a bowl of petunias and a very surprised looking whale..." 
"At an Improbability Factor," cut in Eddie, who hadn't changed a bit, "of eight million seven hundred and sixty-seven thousand one hundred and twenty-eight to one against." 
Zaphod stared at Arthur.â¨"Did you think of that, Earthman?" he demanded. "Well," said Arthur, "all I did was..." 
"That's very good thinking you know. Turn on the Improbability Drive for a second without first activating the proofing screens. Hey kid you just saved our lives, you know that?" 
"Oh," said Arthur, "well, it was nothing really..." 
"Was it?" said Zaphod. "Oh well, forget it then. OK, computer, take us in to land." 
"But..."â¨"I said forget it." 
Another thing that got forgotten was the fact that against all probability a sperm whale had suddenly been called into existence several miles above the surface of an alien planet. 
And since this is not a naturally tenable position for a whale, this poor innocent creature had very little time to come to terms with its identity as a whale before it then had to come to terms with not being a whale any more. 
This is a complete record of its thoughts from the moment it began its life till the moment it ended it. 
Ah...! What's happening? it thought.â¨Er, excuse me, who am I?â¨Hello?â¨Why am I here? What's my purpose in life? What do I mean by who am I? 
Calm down, get a grip now... oh! this is an interesting sensation, what is it? It's a sort of... yawning, tingling sensation in my... my... well I suppose I'd better start finding names for things if I want to make any headway in what for the sake of what I shall call an argument I shall call the world, so let's call it my stomach. 
Good. Ooooh, it's getting quite strong. And hey, what's about this whistling roaring sound going past what I'm suddenly going to call my 
head? Perhaps I can call that... wind! Is that a good name? It'll do... perhaps I can find a better name for it later when I've found out what it's for. It must be something very important because there certainly seems to be a hell of a lot of it. Hey! What's this thing? This... let's call it a tail yeah, tail. Hey! I can really thrash it about pretty good can't I? Wow! Wow! That feels great! Doesn't seem to achieve very much but I'll probably find out what it's for later on. Now have I built up any coherent picture of things yet? 
No. 
Never mind, hey, this is really exciting, so much to find out about, so much to look forward to, I'm quite dizzy with anticipation... 
Or is it the wind? 
There really is a lot of that now isn't it? 
And wow! Hey! What's this thing suddenly coming towards me very fast? Very very fast. So big and flat and round, it needs a big wide sounding name like... ow... ound... round... ground! That's it! That's a good name ground! 
I wonder if it will be friends with me? 
And the rest, after a sudden wet thud, was silence. 
Curiously enough, the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was Oh no, not again. Many people have speculated that if we knew exactly why the bowl of petunias had thought that we would know a lot more about the nature of the universe than we do now. 
Chapter 19 
"Are we taking this robot with us?" said Ford, looking with distaste at Marvin who was standing in an awkward hunched posture in the corner under a small palm tree. 
Zaphod glanced away from the mirror screens which presented a panoramic view of the blighted landscape on which the Heart of Gold had now landed. 
"Oh, the Paranoid Android," he said. "Yeah, we'll take him." 
"But what are supposed to do with a manically depressed robot?" 
"You think you've got problems," said Marvin as if he was addressing a newly occupied coffin, "what are you supposed to do if you are a manically depressed robot? No, don't bother to answer that, I'm fifty thousand times more intelligent than you and even I don't know the answer. It gives me a headache just trying to think down to your level." 
Trillian burst in through the door from her cabin. 
"My white mice have escaped!" she said. 
An expression of deep worry and concern failed to cross either of Zaphod's faces. 
"Nuts to your white mice," he said. 
Trillian glared an upset glare at him, and disappeared again. 
It is possible that her remark would have commanded greater attention had it been generally realized that human beings were only the third most intelligent life form present on the planet Earth, instead of (as was generally thought by most independent observers) the second. 
"Good afternoon boys." 
The voice was oddly familiar, but oddly different. It had a matriarchal twang. It announced itself to the crew as they arrived at the airlock hatchway that would let them out on the planet surface. 
They looked at each other in puzzlement. 
"It's the computer," explained Zaphod. "I discovered it had an emergency back-up personality that I thought might work out better." 
"Now this is going to be your first day out on a strange new planet," continued Eddie's new voice, "so I want you all wrapped up snug and warm, and no playing with any naughty bug-eyed monsters." 
Zaphod tapped impatiently on the hatch. 
"I'm sorry," he said, "I think we might be better off with a slide rule." 
"Right!" snapped the computer. "Who said that?" 
"Will you open the exit hatch please, computer?" said Zaphod trying not to get angry. 
"Not until whoever said that owns up," urged the computer, stamping a few synapses closed. 
"Oh God," muttered Ford, slumped against a bulkhead and started to count to ten. He was desperately worried that one day sentinent life forms would forget how to do this. Only by counting could humans demonstrate their independence of computers. 
"Come on," said Eddie sternly.â¨"Computer..." began Zaphod...â¨"I'm waiting," interrupted Eddie. "I can wait all day if necessary..." 
"Computer..." said Zaphod again, who had been trying to think of some subtle piece of reasoning to put the computer down with, and had decided not to bother competing with it on its own ground, "if you don't open that exit hatch this moment I shall zap straight off to your major data banks and reprogram you with a very large axe, got that?" 
Eddie, shocked, paused and considered this. 
Ford carried on counting quietly. This is about the most aggressive thing you can do to a computer, the equivalent of going up to a human being and saying Blood... blood... blood... blood... 
Finally Eddie said quietly, "I can see this relationship is something we're all going to have to work at," and the hatchway opened. 
An icy wind ripped into them, they hugged themselves warmly and stepped down the ramp on to the barren dust of Magrathea. 
"It'll all end in tears, I know it," shouted Eddie after them and closed the hatchway again. 
A few minutes later he opened and closed the hatchway again in response to a command that caught him entirely by surprise. 
Chapter 20 
Five figures wandered slowly over the blighted land. Bits of it were dullish grey, bits of it dullish brown, the rest of it rather less interesting to look at. It was like a dried-out marsh, now barren of all vegetation and covered with a layer of dust about an inch thick. It was very cold. 
Zaphod was clearly rather depressed about it. He stalked off by himself and was soon lost to sight behind a slight rise in the ground. 
The wind stung Arthur's eyes and ears, and the stale thin air clasped his throat. However, the thing stung most was his mind. 
"It's fantastic..." he said, and his own voice rattled his ears. Sound carried badly in this thin atmosphere. 
"Desolate hole if you ask me," said Ford. "I could have more fun in a cat litter." He felt a mounting irritation. Of all the planets in all the star systems of all the Galaxy didn't he just have to turn up at a dump like this after fifteen years of being a castaway? Not even a hot dog stand in evidence. He stooped down and picked up a cold clot of earth, but there was nothing underneath it worth crossing thousands of light years to look at. 
"No," insisted Arthur, "don't you understand, this is the first time I've actually stood on the surface of another planet... a whole alien world...! Pity it's such a dump though." 
Trillian hugged herself, shivered and frowned. She could have sworn she saw a slight and unexpected movement out of the corner of her eye, but when she glanced in that direction all she could see was the ship, still and silent, a hundred yards or so behind them. 
She was relieved when a second or so later they caught sight of Zaphod standing on top of the ridge of ground and waving to them to come and join him. 
He seemed to be excited, but they couldn't clearly hear what he was saying because of the thinnish atmosphere and the wind. 
As they approached the ridge of higher ground they became aware that it seemed to be circular a crater about a hundred and fifty yards wide. Round the outside of the crater the sloping ground was spattered with black and red lumps. They stopped and looked at a piece. It was wet. It was rubbery. 
With horror they suddenly realized that it was fresh whalemeat. At the top of the crater's lip they met Zaphod.â¨"Look," he said, pointing into the crater. 
In the centre lay the exploded carcass of a lonely sperm whale that hadn't lived long enough to be disappointed with its lot. The silence was only disturbed by the slight involuntary spasms of Trillian's throat. 
"I suppose there's no point in trying to bury it?" murmured Arthur, and then wished he hadn't. 
"Come," said Zaphod and started back down into the crater. "What, down there?" said Trillian with severe distaste.â¨"Yeah," said Zaphod, "come on, I've got something to show you." "We can see it," said Trillian. 
"Not that," said Zaphod, "something else. Come on." They all hesitated.â¨"Come on," insisted Zaphod, "I've found a way in." "In?" said Arthur in horror. 
"Into the interior of the planet! An underground passage. The force of the whale's impact cracked it open, and that's where we have to go. Where no man has trod these five million years, into the very depths of time itself..." 
Marvin started his ironical humming again. 
Zaphod hit him and he shut up. 
With little shudders of disgust they all followed Zaphod down the incline into the crater, trying very hard not to look at its unfortunate creator. 
"Life," said Marvin dolefully, "loathe it or ignore it, you can't like it." 
The ground had caved in where the whale had hit it revealing a network of galleries and passages, now largely obstructed by collapsed rubble and entrails. Zaphod had made a start clearing a way into one of them, but Marvin was able to do it rather faster. Dank air 
wafted out of its dark recesses, and as Zaphod shone a torch into it, little was visible in the dusty gloom. 
"According to the legends," he said, "the Magratheans lived most of their lives underground." 
"Why's that?" said Arthur. "Did the surface become too polluted or overpopulated?" 
"No, I don't think so," said Zaphod. "I think they just didn't like it very much." 
"Are you sure you know what you're doing?" said Trillian peering nervously into the darkness. "We've been attacked once already you know." 
"Look kid, I promise you the live population of this planet is nil plus the four of us, so come on, let's get on in there. Er, hey Earthman..." 
"Arthur," said Arthur. 
"Yeah could you just sort of keep this robot with you and guard this end of the passageway. OK?" 
"Guard?" said Arthur. "What from? You just said there's no one here." 
"Yeah, well, just for safety, OK?" said Zaphod. 
"Whose? Yours or mine?" 
"Good lad. OK, here we go." 
Zaphod scrambled down into the passage, followed by Trillian and Ford. 
"Well I hope you all have a really miserable time," complained Arthur. 
"Don't worry," Marvin assured him, "they will." 
In a few seconds they had disappeared from view. 
Arthur stamped around in a huff, and then decided that a whale's graveyard is not on the whole a good place to stamp around in. 
Marvin eyed him balefully for a moment, and then turned himself off. 
Zaphod marched quickly down the passageway, nervous as hell, but trying to hide it by striding purposefully. He flung the torch beam around. The walls were covered in dark tiles and were cold to the touch, the air thick with decay. 
"There, what did I tell you?" he said. "An inhabited planet. Magrathea," and he strode on through the dirt and debris that littered the tile floor. 
Trillian was reminded unavoidably of the London Underground, though it was less thoroughly squalid. 
At intervals along the walls the tiles gave way to large mosaics simple angular patterns in bright colours. Trillian stopped and studied one of them but could not interpret any sense in them. She called to Zaphod. 
"Hey, have you any idea what these strange symbols are?" 
"I think they're just strange symbols of some kind," said Zaphod, hardly glancing back. 
Trillian shrugged and hurried after him. 
From time to time a doorway led either to the left or right into smallish chambers which Ford discovered to be full of derelict computer equipment. He dragged Zaphod into one to have a look. Trillian followed. 
"Look," said Ford, "you reckon this is Magrathea..." 
"Yeah," said Zaphod, "and we heard the voice, right?" 
"OK, so I've bought the fact that it's Magrathea for the moment. What you have so far said nothing about is how in the Galaxy you found it. You didn't just look it up in a star atlas, that's for sure." 
"Research. Government archives. Detective work. Few lucky guesses. Easy." 
"And then you stole the Heart of Gold to come and look for it with?" 
"I stole it to look for a lot of things." 
"A lot of things?" said Ford in surprise. "Like what?" 
"I don't know." 
"What?" 
"I don't know what I'm looking for." 
"Why not?" 
"Because... because... I think it might be because if I knew I wouldn't be able to look for them." 
"What, are you crazy?" 
"It's a possibility I haven't ruled out yet," said Zaphod quietly. "I only know as much about myself as my mind can work out under its current conditions. And its current conditions are not good." 
For a long time nobody said anything as Ford gazed at Zaphod with a mind suddenly full of worry. 
"Listen old friend, if you want to..." started Ford eventually. 
"No, wait... I'll tell you something," said Zaphod. "I freewheel a lot. I get an idea to do something, and, hey, why not, I do it. I reckon I'll become President of the Galaxy, and it just happens, it's easy. I decide to steal this ship. I decide to look for Magrathea, and it all just happens. Yeah, I work out how it can best be done, right, but it always works out. It's like having a Galacticredit card which keeps on working though you never send off the cheques. And then whenever I stop and think why did I want to do something? how did I work out how to do it? I get a very strong desire just to stop thinking about it. Like I have now. It's a big effort to talk about it." 
Zaphod paused for a while. For a while there was silence. Then he frowned and said, "Last night I was worrying about this again. About the fact that part of my mind just didn't seem to work properly. Then it occurred to me that the way it seemed was that someone else was using my mind to have good ideas with, without telling me about it. I put the two ideas together and decided that maybe that somebody had locked off part of my mind for that purpose, which was why I couldn't use it. I wondered if there was a way I could check. 
"I went to the ship's medical bay and plugged myself into the encephelographic screen. I went through every major screening test on both my heads all the tests I had to go through under government medical officers before my nomination for Presidency could be properly ratified. They showed up nothing. Nothing unexpected at least. They showed that I was clever, imaginative, irresponsible, untrustworthy, extrovert, nothing you couldn't have guessed. And no other anomalies. So I started inventing further tests, completely at random. Nothing. Then I tried superimposing the results from one head on top of the results from the other head. Still nothing. Finally I got silly, because I'd given it all up as nothing more than an attack of paranoia. Last thing I did before I packed it in was take the superimposed picture and look at it through a green filter. You remember I was always superstitious about the color green when 
I was a kid? I always wanted to be a pilot on one of the trading scouts?" 
Ford nodded. 
"And there it was," said Zaphod, "clear as day. A whole section in the middle of both brains that related only to each other and not to anything else around them. Some bastard had cauterized all the synapses and electronically traumatised those two lumps of cerebellum." 
Ford stared at him, aghast. Trillian had turned white. "Somebody did that to you?" whispered Ford. "Yeah."â¨"But have you any idea who? Or why?" 
"Why? I can only guess. But I do know who the bastard was." 
"You know? How do you know?" 
"Because they left their initials burnt into the cauterized synapses. They left them there for me to see." 
Ford stared at him in horror and felt his skin begin to crawl. "Initials? Burnt into your brain?"â¨"Yeah."â¨"Well, what were they, for God's sake?" 
Zaphod looked at him in silence again for a moment. Then he looked away. 
"Z.B.," he said. 
At that moment a steel shutter slammed down behind them and gas started to pour into the chamber. 
"I'll tell you about it later," choked Zaphod as all three passed out. 
Chapter 21 
On the surface of Magrathea Arthur wandered about moodily. 
Ford had thoughtfully left him his copy of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy to while away the time with. He pushed a few buttons at random. 
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a very unevenly edited book and contains many passages that simply seemed to its editors like a good idea at the time. 
One of these (the one Arthur now came across) supposedly relates the experiences of one Veet Voojagig, a quiet young student at the University of Maximegalon, who pursued a brilliant academic career studying ancient philology, transformational ethics and the wave harmonic theory of historical perception, and then, after a night of drinking Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters with Zaphod Beeblebrox, became increasingly obsessed with the problem of what had happened to all the biros he'd bought over the past few years. 
There followed a long period of painstaking research during which he visited all the major centres of biro loss throughout the galaxy and eventually came up with a quaint little theory which quite caught the public imagination at the time. Somewhere in the cosmos, he said, along with all the planets inhabited by humanoids, reptiloids, fishoids, walking treeoids and superintelligent shades of the colour blue, there was also a planet entirely given over to biro life forms. And it was to this planet that unattended biros would make their way, slipping away quietly through wormholes in space to a world where they knew they could enjoy a uniquely biroid lifestyle, responding to highly biro-oriented stimuli, and generally leading the biro equivalent of the good life. 
And as theories go this was all very fine and pleasant until Veet Voojagig suddenly claimed to have found this planet, and to have worked there for a while driving a limousine for a family of cheap green retractables, whereupon he was taken away, locked up, wrote 
a book, and was finally sent into tax exile, which is the usual fate reserved for those who are determined to make a fool of themselves in public. 
When one day an expedition was sent to the spatial coordinates that Voojagig had claimed for this planet they discovered only a small asteroid inhabited by a solitary old man who claimed repeatedly that nothing was true, though he was later discovered to be lying. 
There did, however, remain the question of both the mysterious 60,000 Altairan dollars paid yearly into his Brantisvogan bank account, and of course Zaphod Beeblebrox's highly profitable second-hand biro business. 
Arthur read this, and put the book down. 
The robot still sat there, completely inert. 
Arthur got up and walked to the top of the crater. He walked around the crater. He watched two suns set magnificently over Magrathea. 
He went back down into the crater. He woke the robot up because even a manically depressed robot is better to talk to than nobody. 
"Night's falling," he said. "Look robot, the stars are coming out." 
From the heart of a dark nebula it is possible to see very few stars, and only very faintly, but they were there to be seen. 
The robot obediently looked at them, then looked back. 
"I know," he said. "Wretched isn't it?" 
"But that sunset! I've never seen anything like it in my wildest dreams... the two suns! It was like mountains of fire boiling into space." 
"I've seen it," said Marvin. "It's rubbish." 
"We only ever had the one sun at home," persevered Arthur, "I came from a planet called Earth you know." 
"I know," said Marvin, "you keep going on about it. It sounds awful." 
"Ah no, it was a beautiful place."â¨"Did it have oceans?"â¨"Oh yes," said Arthur with a sigh, "great wide rolling blue oceans..." "Can't bear oceans," said Marvin. 
"Tell me," inquired Arthur, "do you get on well with other robots?" "Hate them," said Marvin. "Where are you going?"â¨Arthur couldn't bear any more. He had got up again.â¨"I think I'll just take another walk," he said. 
"Don't blame you," said Marvin and counted five hundred and ninety-seven thousand million sheep before falling asleep again a second later. 
Arthur slapped his arms about himself to try and get his circulation a little more enthusiastic about its job. He trudged back up the wall of the crater. 
Because the atmosphere was so thin and because there was no moon, nightfall was very rapid and it was by now very dark. Because of this, Arthur practically walked into the old man before he noticed him. 
Chapter 22 
He was standing with his back to Arthur watching the very last glimmers of light sink into blackness behind the horizon. He was tallish, elderly and dressed in a single long grey robe. When he turned his face was thin and distinguished, careworn but not unkind, the sort of face you would happily bank with. But he didn't turn yet, not even to react to Arthur's yelp of surprise. 
Eventually the last rays of the sun had vanished completely, and he turned. His face was still illuminated from somewhere, and when Arthur looked for the source of the light he saw that a few yards away stood a small craft of some kind a small hovercraft, Arthur guessed. It shed a dim pool of light around it. 
The man looked at Arthur, sadly it seemed. 
"You choose a cold night to visit our dead planet," he said. 
"Who... who are you?" stammered Arthur. 
The man looked away. Again a kind of sadness seemed to cross his face. 
"My name is not important," he said. 
He seemed to have something on his mind. Conversation was clearly something he felt he didn't have to rush at. Arthur felt awkward. 
"I... er... you startled me..." he said, lamely. 
The man looked round to him again and slightly raised his eyebrows. 
"Hmmmm?" he said. 
"I said you startled me." 
"Do not be alarmed, I will not harm you." 
Arthur frowned at him. "But you shot at us! There were missiles..." he said. 
The man chuckled slightly. 
"An automatic system," he said and gave a small sigh. "Ancient computers ranged in the bowels of the planet tick away the dark millennia, and the ages hang heavy on their dusty data banks. I think they take the occasional pot shot to relieve the monotony." 
He looked gravely at Arthur and said, "I'm a great fan of science you know." 
"Oh... er, really?" said Arthur, who was beginning to find the man's curious, kindly manner disconcerting. 
"Oh, yes," said the old man, and simply stopped talking again. 
"Ah," said Arthur, "er..." He had an odd felling of being like a man in the act of adultery who is surprised when the woman's husband wanders into the room, changes his trousers, passes a few idle remarks about the weather and leaves again. 
"You seem ill at ease," said the old man with polite concern. 
"Er, no... well, yes. Actually you see, we weren't really expecting to find anybody about in fact. I sort of gathered that you were all dead or something..." 
"Dead?" said the old man. "Good gracious no, we have but slept." 
"Slept?" said Arthur incredulously. 
"Yes, through the economic recession you see," said the old man, apparently unconcerned about whether Arthur understood a word he was talking about or not. 
"Er, economic recession?" 
"Well you see, five million years ago the Galactic economy collapsed, and seeing that custom-made planets are something of a luxury commodity you see..." 
He paused and looked at Arthur.â¨"You know we built planets do you?" he asked solemnly. "Well yes," said Arthur, "I'd sort of gathered..." 
"Fascinating trade," said the old man, and a wistful look came into his eyes, "doing the coastlines was always my favourite. Used to have endless fun doing the little bits in fjords... so anyway," he said trying to find his thread again, "the recession came and we decided it would save us a lot of bother if we just slept through it. So we programmed the computers to revive us when it was all over." 
The man stifled a very slight yawn and continued. 
"The computers were index linked to the Galactic stock market prices you see, so that we'd all be revived when everybody else had rebuilt the economy enough to afford our rather expensive services." 
Arthur, a regular Guardian reader, was deeply shocked at this. 
"That's a pretty unpleasant way to behave isn't it?" 
"Is it?" asked the old man mildly. "I'm sorry, I'm a bit out of touch." 
He pointed down into the crater. 
"Is that robot yours?" he said. 
"No," came a thin metallic voice from the crater, "I'm mine." 
"If you'd call it a robot," muttered Arthur. "It's more a sort of electronic sulking machine." 
"Bring it," said the old man. Arthur was quite surprised to hear a note of decision suddenly present in the old man's voice. He called to Marvin who crawled up the slope making a big show of being lame, which he wasn't. 
"On second thoughts," said the old man, "leave it here. You must come with me. Great things are afoot." He turned towards his craft which, though no apparent signal had been given, now drifted quietly towards them through the dark. 
Arthur looked down at Marvin, who now made an equally big show of turning round laboriously and trudging off down into the crater again muttering sour nothings to himself. 
"Come," called the old man, "come now or you will be late." "Late?" said Arthur. "What for?"â¨"What is your name, human?"â¨"Dent. Arthur Dent," said Arthur. 
"Late, as in the late Dentarthurdent," said the old man, sternly. "It's a sort of threat you see." Another wistful look came into his tired old eyes. "I've never been very good at them myself, but I'm told they can be very effective." 
Arthur blinked at him.â¨"What an extraordinary person," he muttered to himself. "I beg your pardon?" said the old man. 
"Oh nothing, I'm sorry," said Arthur in embarrassment. "Alright, where do we go?" 
"In my aircar," said the old man motioning Arthur to get into the craft which had settled silently next to them. "We are going deep into the bowels of the planet where even now our race is being revived from its five-million-year slumber. Magrathea awakes." 
Arthur shivered involuntarily as he seated himself next to the old man. The strangeness of it, the silent bobbing movement of the craft as it soared into the night sky quite unsettled him. 
He looked at the old man, his face illuminated by the dull glow of tiny lights on the instrument panel. 
"Excuse me," he said to him, "what is your name by the way?" 
"My name?" said the old man, and the same distant sadness came into his face again. He paused. "My name," he said, "... is Slartibartfast." 
Arthur practically choked.â¨"I beg your pardon?" he spluttered. "Slartibartfast," repeated the old man quietly. "Slartibartfast?"â¨The old man looked at him gravely.â¨"I said it wasn't important," he said.â¨The aircar sailed through the night. 
Chapter 23 
It is an important and popular fact that things are not always what they seem. For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much the wheel, New York, wars and so on whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man for precisely the same reasons. 
Curiously enough, the dolphins had long known of the impending destruction of the planet Earth and had made many attempts to alert mankind of the danger; but most of their communications were misinterpreted as amusing attempts to punch footballs or whistle for tidbits, so they eventually gave up and left the Earth by their own means shortly before the Vogons arrived. 
The last ever dolphin message was misinterpreted as a surprisingly sophisticated attempt to do a double-backwards-somersault through a hoop whilst whistling the "Star Sprangled Banner", but in fact the message was this: So long and thanks for all the fish. 
In fact there was only one species on the planet more intelligent than dolphins, and they spent a lot of their time in behavioural research laboratories running round inside wheels and conducting frighteningly elegant and subtle experiments on man. The fact that once again man completely misinterpreted this relationship was entirely according to these creatures' plans. 
Chapter 24 
Silently the aircar coasted through the cold darkness, a single soft glow of light that was utterly alone in the deep Magrathean night. It sped swiftly. Arthur's companion seemed sunk in his own thoughts, and when Arthur tried on a couple of occasions to engage him in conversation again he would simply reply by asking if he was comfortable enough, and then left it at that. 
Arthur tried to gauge the speed at which they were travelling, but the blackness outside was absolute and he was denied any reference points. The sense of motion was so soft and slight he could almost believe they were hardly moving at all. 
Then a tiny glow of light appeared in the far distance and within seconds had grown so much in size that Arthur realized it was travelling towards them at a colossal speed, and he tried to make out what sort of craft it might be. He peered at it, but was unable to discern any clear shape, and suddenly gasped in alarm as the aircraft dipped sharply and headed downwards in what seemed certain to be a collision course. Their relative velocity seemed unbelievable, and Arthur had hardly time to draw breath before it was all over. The next thing he was aware of was an insane silver blur that seemed to surround him. He twisted his head sharply round and saw a small black point dwindling rapidly in the distance behind them, and it took him several seconds to realize what had happened. 
They had plunged into a tunnel in the ground. The colossal speed had been their own relative to the glow of light which was a stationary hole in the ground, the mouth of the tunnel. The insane blur of silver was the circular wall of the tunnel down which they were shooting, apparently at several hundred miles an hour. 
He closed his eyes in terror. 
After a length of time which he made no attempt to judge, he sensed a slight subsidence in their speed and some while later became aware that they were gradually gliding to a gentle halt. 
He opened his eyes again. They were still in the silver tunnel, threading and weaving their way through what appeared to be a crisscross warren of converging tunnels. When they finally stopped it was in a small chamber of curved steel. Several tunnels also had their terminus here, and at the farther end of the chamber Arthur could see a large circle of dim irritating light. It was irritating because it played tricks with the eyes, it was impossible to focus on it properly or tell how near or far it was. Arthur guessed (quite wrongly) that it might be ultra violet. 
Slartibartfast turned and regarded Arthur with his solemn old eyes. "Earthman," he said, "we are now deep in the heart of Magrathea." "How did you know I was an Earthman?" demanded Arthur. 
"These things will become clear to you," said the old man gently, "at least," he added with slight doubt in his voice, "clearer than they are at the moment." 
He continued: "I should warn you that the chamber we are about to pass into does not literally exist within our planet. It is a little too... large. We are about to pass through a gateway into a vast tract of hyperspace. It may disturb you." 
Arthur made nervous noises. 
Slartibartfast touched a button and added, not entirely reassuringly. "It scares the willies out of me. Hold tight." 
The car shot forward straight into the circle of light, and suddenly Arthur had a fairly clear idea of what infinity looked like. 
It wasn't infinity in fact. Infinity itself looks flat and uninteresting. Looking up into the night sky is looking into infinity distance is incomprehensible and therefore meaningless. The chamber into which the aircar emerged was anything but infinite, it was just very very big, so that it gave the impression of infinity far better than infinity itself. 
Arthur's senses bobbed and span, as, travelling at the immense speed he knew the aircar attained, they climbed slowly through the open air leaving the gateway through which they had passed an invisible pinprick in the shimmering wall behind them. 
The wall. 
The wall defied the imagination seduced it and defeated it. The wall was so paralysingly vast and sheer that its top, bottom and sides passed away beyond the reach of sight. The mere shock of vertigo could kill a man. 
The wall appeared perfectly flat. It would take the finest laser measuring equipment to detect that as it climbed, apparently to infinity, as it dropped dizzily away, as it planed out to either side, it also curved. It met itself again thirteen light seconds away. In other words the wall formed the inside of a hollow sphere, a sphere over three million miles across and flooded with unimaginable light. 
"Welcome," said Slartibartfast as the tiny speck that was the aircar, travelling now at three times the speed of sound, crept imperceptibly forward into the mindboggling space, "welcome," he said, "to our factory floor." 
Arthur stared about him in a kind of wonderful horror. Rangedâ¨away before them, at distances he could neither judge nor even guess at, were a series of curious suspensions, delicate traceries of metal and light hung about shadowy spherical shapes that hung in the space. 
"This," said Slartibartfast, "is where we make most of our planets you see." 
"You mean," said Arthur, trying to form the words, "you mean you're starting it all up again now?" 
"No no, good heavens no," exclaimed the old man, "no, the Galaxy isn't nearly rich enough to support us yet. No, we've been awakened to perform just one extraordinary commission for very... special clients from another dimension. It may interest you... there in the distance in front of us." 
Arthur followed the old man's finger, till he was able to pick out the floating structure he was pointing out. It was indeed the only one of the many structures that betrayed any sign of activity about it, though this was more a sublimal impression than anything one could put one's finger on. 
At the moment however a flash of light arced through the structure and revealed in stark relief the patterns that were formed on the dark sphere within. Patterns that Arthur knew, rough blobby shapes that were as familiar to him as the shapes of words, part of the furniture of his mind. For a few seconds he sat in stunned silence as the images 
rushed around his mind and tried to find somewhere to settle down and make sense. 
Part of his brain told him that he knew perfectly well what he was looking at and what the shapes represented whilst another quite sensibly refused to countenance the idea and abdicated responsibility for any further thinking in that direction. 
The flash came again, and this time there could be no doubt. 
"The Earth..." whispered Arthur. 
"Well, the Earth Mark Two in fact," said Slartibartfast cheerfully. "We're making a copy from our original blueprints." 
There was a pause. 
"Are you trying to tell me," said Arthur, slowly and with control, "that you originally... made the Earth?" 
"Oh yes," said Slartibartfast. "Did you ever go to a place... I think it was called Norway?" 
"No," said Arthur, "no, I didn't." 
"Pity," said Slartibartfast, "that was one of mine. Won an award you know. Lovely crinkly edges. I was most upset to hear about its destruction." 
"You were upset!" 
"Yes. Five minutes later and it wouldn't have mattered so much. It was a quite shocking cock-up." 
"Huh?" said Arthur. 
"The mice were furious." 
"The mice were furious?" 
"Oh yes," said the old man mildly. 
"Yes well so I expect were the dogs and cats and duckbilled platypuses, but..." 
"Ah, but they hadn't paid for it you see, had they?" 
"Look," said Arthur, "would it save you a lot of time if I just gave up and went mad now?" 
For a while the aircar flew on in awkward silence. Then the old man tried patiently to explain. 
"Earthman, the planet you lived on was commissioned, paid for, and run by mice. It was destroyed five minutes before the completion 
of the purpose for which it was built, and we've got to build another one." 
Only one word registered with Arthur. "Mice?" he said.â¨"Indeed Earthman." 
"Look, sorry are we talking about the little white furry things with the cheese fixation and women standing on tables screaming in early sixties sit coms?" 
Slartibartfast coughed politely. 
"Earthman," he said, "it is sometimes hard to follow your mode of speech. Remember I have been asleep inside this planet of Magrathea for five million years and know little of these early sixties sit coms of which you speak. These creatures you call mice, you see, they are not quite as they appear. They are merely the protrusion into our dimension of vast hyperintelligent pan-dimensional beings. The whole business with the cheese and the squeaking is just a front." 
The old man paused, and with a sympathetic frown continued. "They've been experimenting on you I'm afraid."â¨Arthur thought about this for a second, and then his face cleared. 
"Ah no," he said, "I see the source of the misunderstanding now. No, look you see, what happened was that we used to do experiments on them. They were often used in behavioural research, Pavlov and all that sort of stuff. So what happened was hat the mice would be set all sorts of tests, learning to ring bells, run around mazes and things so that the whole nature of the learning process could be examined. From our observations of their behaviour we were able to learn all sorts of things about our own..." 
Arthur's voice tailed off.â¨"Such subtlety..." said Slartibartfast, "one has to admire it." "What?" said Arthur. 
"How better to disguise their real natures, and how better to guide your thinking. Suddenly running down a maze the wrong way, eating the wrong bit of cheese, unexpectedly dropping dead of myxomatosis, if it's finely calculated the cumulative effect is enormous." 
He paused for effect. 
"You see, Earthman, they really are particularly clever hyperintelligent pan-dimensional beings. Your planet and people have formed the matrix of an organic computer running a ten-million-year research programme... 
"Let me tell you the whole story. It'll take a little time."â¨"Time," said Arthur weakly, "is not currently one of my problems." 
Chapter 25 
There are of course many problems connected with life, of which some of the most popular are Why are people born? Why do they die? Why do they want to spend so much of the intervening time wearing digital watches? 
Many many millions of years ago a race of hyperintelligent pan- dimensional beings (whose physical manifestation in their own pan- dimensional universe is not dissimilar to our own) got so fed up with the constant bickering about the meaning of life which used to interrupt their favourite pastime of Brockian Ultra Cricket (a curious game which involved suddenly hitting people for no readily apparent reason and then running away) that they decided to sit down and solve their problems once and for all. 
And to this end they built themselves a stupendous super computer which was so amazingly intelligent that even before the data banks had been connected up it had started from I think therefore I am and got as far as the existence of rice pudding and income tax before anyone managed to turn it off. 
It was the size of a small city. 
Its main console was installed in a specially designed executive office, mounted on an enormous executive desk of finest ultramahagony topped with rich ultrared leather. The dark carpeting was discreetly sumptuous, exotic pot plants and tastefully engraved prints of the principal computer programmers and their families were deployed liberally about the room, and stately windows looked out upon a tree-lined public square. 
On the day of the Great On-Turning two soberly dressed programmers with brief cases arrived and were shown discreetly into the office. They were aware that this day they would represent their entire race in its greatest moment, but they conducted themselves calmly and quietly as they seated themselves deferentially before the 
desk, opened their brief cases and took out their leather-bound notebooks. 
Their names were Lunkwill and Fook. 
For a few moments they sat in respectful silence, then, after exchanging a quiet glance with Fook, Lunkwill leaned forward and touched a small black panel. 
The subtlest of hums indicated that the massive computer was now in total active mode. After a pause it spoke to them in a voice rich resonant and deep. 
It said: "What is this great task for which I, Deep Thought, the second greatest computer in the Universe of Time and Space have been called into existence?" 
Lunkwill and Fook glanced at each other in surprise. 
"Your task, O Computer..." began Fook. 
"No, wait a minute, this isn't right," said Lunkwill, worried. "We distinctly designed this computer to be the greatest one ever and we're not making do with second best. Deep Thought," he addressed the computer, "are you not as we designed you to be, the greatest most powerful computer in all time?" 
"I described myself as the second greatest," intoned Deep Thought, "and such I am." 
Another worried look passed between the two programmers. Lunkwill cleared his throat. 
"There must be some mistake," he said, "are you not a greatest computer than the Milliard Gargantubrain which can count all the atoms in a star in a millisecond?" 
"The Milliard Gargantubrain?" said Deep Thought with unconcealed contempt. "A mere abacus mention it not." 
"And are you not," said Fook leaning anxiously forward, "a greater analyst than the Googleplex Star Thinker in the Seventh Galaxy of Light and Ingenuity which can calculate the trajectory of every single dust particle throughout a five-week Dangrabad Beta sand blizzard?" 
"A five-week sand blizzard?" said Deep Thought haughtily. "You ask this of me who have contemplated the very vectors of the atoms in the Big Bang itself? Molest me not with this pocket calculator stuff." 
The two programmers sat in uncomfortable silence for a moment. Then Lunkwill leaned forward again. 
"But are you not," he said, "a more fiendish disputant than the Great Hyperlobic Omni-Cognate Neutron Wrangler of Ciceronicus 12, the Magic and Indefatigable?" 
"The Great Hyperlobic Omni-Cognate Neutron Wrangler," said Deep Thought thoroughly rolling the r's, "could talk all four legs off an Arcturan MegaDonkey but only I could persuade it to go for a walk afterwards." 
"Then what," asked Fook, "is the problem?" 
"There is no problem," said Deep Thought with magnificent ringing tones. "I am simply the second greatest computer in the Universe of Space and Time." 
"But the second?" insisted Lunkwill. "Why do you keep saying the second? You're surely not thinking of the Multicorticoid Perspicutron Titan Muller are you? Or the Pondermatic? Or the..." 
Contemptuous lights flashed across the computer's console. 
"I spare not a single unit of thought on these cybernetic simpletons!" he boomed. "I speak of none but the computer that is to come after me!" 
Fook was losing patience. He pushed his notebook aside and muttered, "I think this is getting needlessly messianic." 
"You know nothing of future time," pronounced Deep Thought, "and yet in my teeming circuitry I can navigate the infinite delta streams of future probability and see that there must one day come a computer whose merest operational parameters I am not worthy to calculate, but which it will be my fate eventually to design." 
Fook sighed heavily and glanced across to Lunkwill. "Can we get on and ask the question?" he said. Lunkwill motioned him to wait.â¨"What computer is this of which you speak?" he asked. 
"I will speak of it no further in this present time," said Deep Thought. "Now. Ask what else of me you will that I may function. Speak." 
They shrugged at each other. Fook composed himself. 
"O Deep Thought Computer," he said, "the task we have designed you to perform is this. We want you to tell us..." he paused, "... the Answer!" 
"The answer?" said Deep Thought. "The answer to what?" "Life!" urged Fook.â¨"The Universe!" said Lunkwill.â¨"Everything!" they said in chorus. 
Deep Thought paused for a moment's reflection. "Tricky," he said finally.â¨"But can you do it?"â¨Again, a significant pause. 
"Yes," said Deep Thought, "I can do it." 
"There is an answer?" said Fook with breathless excitement." 
"A simple answer?" added Lunkwill. 
"Yes," said Deep Thought. "Life, the Universe, and Everything. There is an answer. But," he added, "I'll have to think about it." 
A sudden commotion destroyed the moment: the door flew open and two angry men wearing the coarse faded blue robes and belts of the Cruxwan University burst into the room, thrusting aside the ineffectual flunkies who tried to bar their way. 
"We demand admission!" shouted the younger of the two men elbowing a pretty young secretary in the throat. 
"Come on," shouted the older one, "you can't keep us out!" He pushed a junior programmer back through the door. 
"We demand that you can't keep us out!" bawled the younger one, though he was now firmly inside the room and no further attempts were being made to stop him. 
"Who are you?" said Lunkwill, rising angrily from his seat. "What do you want?" 
"I am Majikthise!" announced the older one. 
"And I demand that I am Vroomfondel!" shouted the younger one. 
Majikthise turned on Vroomfondel. "It's alright," he explained angrily, "you don't need to demand that." 
"Alright!" bawled Vroomfondel banging on an nearby desk. "I am Vroomfondel, and that is not a demand, that is a solid fact! What we demand is solid facts!" 
"No we don't!" exclaimed Majikthise in irritation. "That is precisely what we don't demand!" 
Scarcely pausing for breath, Vroomfondel shouted, "We don't demand solid facts! What we demand is a total absence of solid facts. I demand that I may or may not be Vroomfondel!" 
"But who the devil are you?" exclaimed an outraged Fook. 
"We," said Majikthise, "are Philosophers." 
"Though we may not be," said Vroomfondel waving a warning finger at the programmers. 
"Yes we are," insisted Majikthise. "We are quite definitely here as representatives of the Amalgamated Union of Philosophers, Sages, Luminaries and Other Thinking Persons, and we want this machine off, and we want it off now!" 
"What's the problem?" said Lunkwill. 
"I'll tell you what the problem is mate," said Majikthise, "demarcation, that's the problem!" 
"We demand," yelled Vroomfondel, "that demarcation may or may not be the problem!" 
"You just let the machines get on with the adding up," warned Majikthise, "and we'll take care of the eternal verities thank you very much. You want to check your legal position you do mate. Under law the Quest for Ultimate Truth is quite clearly the inalienable prerogative of your working thinkers. Any bloody machine goes and actually finds it and we're straight out of a job aren't we? I mean what's the use of our sitting up half the night arguing that there may or may not be a God if this machine only goes and gives us his bleeding phone number the next morning?" 
"That's right!" shouted Vroomfondel, "we demand rigidly defined areas of doubt and uncertainty!" 
Suddenly a stentorian voice boomed across the room. 
"Might I make an observation at this point?" inquired Deep Thought. 
"We'll go on strike!" yelled Vroomfondel. 
"That's right!" agreed Majikthise. "You'll have a national Philosopher's strike on your hands!" 
The hum level in the room suddenly increased as several ancillary bass driver units, mounted in sedately carved and varnished cabinet speakers around the room, cut in to give Deep Thought's voice a little more power. 
"All I wanted to say," bellowed the computer, "is that my circuits are now irrevocably committed to calculating the answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything " he paused and satisfied himself that he now had everyone's attention, before continuing more quietly, "but the programme will take me a little while to run." 
Fook glanced impatiently at his watch.â¨"How long?" he said.â¨"Seven and a half million years," said Deep Thought. Lunkwill and Fook blinked at each other.â¨"Seven and a half million years...!" they cried in chorus. 
"Yes," declaimed Deep Thought, "I said I'd have to think about it, didn't I? And it occurs to me that running a programme like this is bound to create an enormous amount of popular publicity for the whole area of philosophy in general. Everyone's going to have their own theories about what answer I'm eventually to come up with, and who better to capitalize on that media market than you yourself? So long as you can keep disagreeing with each other violently enough and slagging each other off in the popular press, you can keep yourself on the gravy train for life. How does that sound?" 
The two philosophers gaped at him. 
"Bloody hell," said Majikthise, "now that is what I call thinking. Here Vroomfondel, why do we never think of things like that?" 
"Dunno," said Vroomfondel in an awed whisper, "think our brains must be too highly trained Majikthise." 
So saying, they turned on their heels and walked out of the door and into a lifestyle beyond their wildest dreams. 
Chapter 26 
"Yes, very salutary," said Arthur, after Slartibartfast had related the salient points of the story to him, "but I don't understand what all this has got to do with the Earth and mice and things." 
"That is but the first half of the story Earthman," said the old man. "If you would care to discover what happened seven and a half millions later, on the great day of the Answer, allow me to invite you to my study where you can experience the events yourself on our Sens-O-Tape records. That is unless you would care to take a quick stroll on the surface of New Earth. It's only half completed I'm afraid we haven't even finished burying the artificial dinosaur skeletons in the crust yet, then we have the Tertiary and Quarternary Periods of the Cenozoic Era to lay down, and..." 
"No thank you," said Arthur, "it wouldn't be quite the same." 
"No," said Slartibartfast, "it won't be," and he turned the aircar round and headed back towards the mind-numbing wall. 
Chapter 27 
Slartibartfast's study was a total mess, like the results of an explosion in a public library. The old man frowned as they stepped in. 
"Terribly unfortunate," he said, "a diode blew in one of the life- support computers. When we tried to revive our cleaning staff we discovered they'd been dead for nearly thirty thousand years. Who's going to clear away the bodies, that's what I want to know. Look why don't you sit yourself down over there and let me plug you in?" 
He gestured Arthur towards a chair which looked as if it had been made out of the rib cage of a stegosaurus. 
"It was made out of the rib cage of a stegosaurus," explained the old man as he pottered about fishing bits of wire out from under tottering piles of paper and drawing instruments. "Here," he said, "hold these," and passed a couple of stripped wire end to Arthur. 
The instant he took hold of them a bird flew straight through him. 
He was suspended in mid-air and totally invisible to himself. Beneath him was a pretty treelined city square, and all around it as far as the eye could see were white concrete buildings of airy spacious design but somewhat the worse for wear many were cracked and stained with rain. Today however the sun was shining, a fresh breeze danced lightly through the trees, and the odd sensation that all the buildings were quietly humming was probably caused by the fact that the square and all the streets around it were thronged with cheerful excited people. Somewhere a band was playing, brightly coloured flags were fluttering in the breeze and the spirit of carnival was in the air. 
Arthur felt extraordinarily lonely stuck up in the air above it all without so much as a body to his name, but before he had time to reflect on this a voice rang out across the square and called for everyone's attention. 
A man standing on a brightly dressed dais before the building which clearly dominated the square was addressing the crowd over a Tannoy. 
"O people waiting in the Shadow of Deep Thought!" he cried out. "Honoured Descendants of Vroomfondel and Majikthise, the Greatest and Most Truly Interesting Pundits the Universe has ever known... The Time of Waiting is over!" 
Wild cheers broke out amongst the crowd. Flags, streamers and wolf whistles sailed through the air. The narrower streets looked rather like centipedes rolled over on their backs and frantically waving their legs in the air. 
"Seven and a half million years our race has waited for this Great and Hopefully Enlightening Day!" cried the cheer leader. "The Day of the Answer!" 
Hurrahs burst from the ecstatic crowd. 
"Never again," cried the man, "never again will we wake up in the morning and think Who am I? What is my purpose in life? Does it really, cosmically speaking, matter if I don't get up and go to work? For today we will finally learn once and for all the plain and simple answer to all these nagging little problems of Life, the Universe and Everything!" 
As the crowd erupted once again, Arthur found himself gliding through the air and down towards one of the large stately windows on the first floor of the building behind the dais from which the speaker was addressing the crowd. 
He experienced a moment's panic as he sailed straight through towards the window, which passed when a second or so later he found he had gone right through the solid glass without apparently touching it. 
No one in the room remarked on his peculiar arrival, which is hardly surprising as he wasn't there. He began to realize that the whole experience was merely a recorded projection which knocked six-track seventy-millimetre into a cocked hat. 
The room was much as Slartibartfast had described it. In seven and a half million years it had been well looked after and cleaned regularly every century or so. The ultramahagony desk was worn at the edges, the carpet a little faded now, but the large computer terminal sat in 
sparkling glory on the desk's leather top, as bright as if it had been constructed yesterday. 
Two severely dressed men sat respectfully before the terminal and waited. 
"The time is nearly upon us," said one, and Arthur was surprised to see a word suddenly materialize in thin air just by the man's neck. The word was Loonquawl, and it flashed a couple of times and the disappeared again. Before Arthur was able to assimilate this the other man spoke and the word Phouchg appeared by his neck. 
"Seventy-five thousand generations ago, our ancestors set this program in motion," the second man said, "and in all that time we will be the first to hear the computer speak." 
"An awesome prospect, Phouchg," agreed the first man, and Arthur suddenly realized that he was watching a recording with subtitles. 
"We are the ones who will hear," said Phouchg, "the answer to the great question of Life...!" 
"The Universe...!" said Loonquawl. 
"And Everything...!" 
"Shhh," said Loonquawl with a slight gesture, "I think Deep Thought is preparing to speak!" 
There was a moment's expectant pause whilst panels slowly came to life on the front of the console. Lights flashed on and off experimentally and settled down into a businesslike pattern. A soft low hum came from the communication channel. 
"Good morning," said Deep Thought at last. 
"Er... Good morning, O Deep Thought," said Loonquawl nervously, "do you have... er, that is..." 
"An answer for you?" interrupted Deep Thought majestically. "Yes. I have." 
The two men shivered with expectancy. Their waiting had not been in vain. 
"There really is one?" breathed Phouchg. 
"There really is one," confirmed Deep Thought. 
"To Everything? To the great Question of Life, the Universe and Everything?" 
"Yes." 
Both of the men had been trained for this moment, their lives had been a preparation for it, they had been selected at birth as those who would witness the answer, but even so they found themselves gasping and squirming like excited children. 
"And you're ready to give it to us?" urged Loonquawl. "I am."â¨"Now?"â¨"Now," said Deep Thought. 
They both licked their dry lips. 
"Though I don't think," added Deep Thought, "that you're going to like it." 
"Doesn't matter!" said Phouchg. "We must know it! Now!" 
"Now?" inquired Deep Thought. 
"Yes! Now..." 
"Alright," said the computer and settled into silence again. The two men fidgeted. The tension was unbearable. 
"You're really not going to like it," observed Deep Thought. 
"Tell us!" 
"Alright," said Deep Thought. "The Answer to the Great Question..." 
"Yes...!"â¨"Of Life, the Universe and Everything..." said Deep Thought. "Yes...!"â¨"Is..." said Deep Thought, and paused.â¨"Yes...!"â¨"Is..."â¨"Yes...!!!...?"â¨"Forty-two," said Deep Thought, with infinite majesty and calm. 
Chapter 28 
It was a long time before anyone spoke. 
Out of the corner of his eye Phouchg could see the sea of tense expectant faces down in the square outside. 
"We're going to get lynched aren't we?" he whispered. 
"It was a tough assignment," said Deep Thought mildly. 
"Forty-two!" yelled Loonquawl. "Is that all you've got to show for seven and a half million years' work?" 
"I checked it very thoroughly," said the computer, "and that quite definitely is the answer. I think the problem, to be quite honest with you, is that you've never actually known what the question is." 
"But it was the Great Question! The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything!" howled Loonquawl. 
"Yes," said Deep Thought with the air of one who suffers fools gladly, "but what actually is it?" 
A slow stupefied silence crept over the men as they stared at the computer and then at each other. 
"Well, you know, it's just Everything... Everything..." offered Phouchg weakly. 
"Exactly!" said Deep Thought. "So once you do know what the question actually is, you'll know what the answer means." 
"Oh terrific," muttered Phouchg flinging aside his notebook and wiping away a tiny tear. 
"Look, alright, alright," said Loonquawl, "can you just please tell us the Question?" 
"The Ultimate Question?"â¨"Yes!"â¨"Of Life, the Universe, and Everything?" "Yes!"â¨Deep Thought pondered this for a moment. 
"Tricky," he said.â¨"But can you do it?" cried Loonquawl.â¨Deep Thought pondered this for another long moment. Finally: "No," he said firmly.â¨Both men collapsed on to their chairs in despair.â¨"But I'll tell you who can," said Deep Thought.â¨They both looked up sharply.â¨"Who?" "Tell us!" 
Suddenly Arthur began to feel his apparently non-existent scalp begin to crawl as he found himself moving slowly but inexorably forward towards the console, but it was only a dramatic zoom on the part of whoever had made the recording he assumed. 
"I speak of none other than the computer that is to come after me," intoned Deep Thought, his voice regaining its accustomed declamatory tones. "A computer whose merest operational parameters I am not worthy to calculate and yet I will design it for you. A computer which can calculate the Question to the Ultimate Answer, a computer of such infinite and subtle complexity that organic life itself shall form part of its operational matrix. And you yourselves shall take on new forms and go down into the computer to navigate its ten-million-year program! Yes! I shall design this computer for you. And I shall name it also unto you. And it shall be called... The Earth." 
Phouchg gaped at Deep Thought. 
"What a dull name," he said and great incisions appeared down the length of his body. Loonquawl too suddenly sustained horrific gashed from nowhere. The Computer console blotched and cracked, the walls flickered and crumbled and the room crashed upwards into its own ceiling... 
Slartibartfast was standing in front of Arthur holding the two wires. "End of the tape," he explained. 
Chapter 29 
"Zaphod! Wake up!" 
"Mmmmmwwwwwerrrrr?" 
"Hey come on, wake up." 
"Just let me stick to what I'm good at, yeah?" muttered Zaphod and rolled away from the voice back to sleep. 
"Do you want me to kick you?" said Ford. 
"Would it give you a lot of pleasure?" said Zaphod, blearily. 
"No." 
"Nor me. So what's the point? Stop bugging me." Zaphod curled himself up. 
"He got a double dose of the gas," said Trillian looking down at him, "two windpipes." 
"And stop talking," said Zaphod, "it's hard enough trying to sleep anyway. What's the matter with the ground? It's all cold and hard." 
"It's gold," said Ford. 
With an amazingly balletic movement Zaphod was standing and scanning the horizon, because that was how far the gold ground stretched in every direction, perfectly smooth and solid. It gleamed like... it's impossible to say what it gleamed like because nothing in the Universe gleams in quite the same way that a planet of solid gold does. 
"Who put all that there?" yelped Zaphod, goggle-eyed. "Don't get excited," said Ford, "it's only a catalogue." "A who?"â¨"A catalogue," said Trillian, "an illusion." 
"How can you say that?" cried Zaphod, falling to his hands and knees and staring at the ground. He poked it and prodded it with his fingernail. It was very heavy and very slightly soft he could mark it with his fingernail. It was very yellow and very shiny, and when he 
breathed on it his breath evaporated off it in that very peculiar and special way that breath evaporates off solid gold. 
"Trillian and I came round a while ago," said Ford. "We shouted and yelled till somebody came and then carried on shouting and yelling till they got fed up and put us in their planet catalogue to keep us busy till they were ready to deal with us. This is all Sens-O-Tape." 
Zaphod stared at him bitterly. 
"Ah, shit," he said, "you wake me up from my own perfectly good dream to show me somebody else's." He sat down in a huff. 
"What's that series of valleys over there?" he said. 
"Hallmark," said Ford. "We had a look." 
"We didn't wake you earlier," said Trillian. "The last planet was knee deep in fish." 
"Fish?" 
"Some people like the oddest things." 
"And before that," said Ford, "we had platinum. Bit dull. We thought you'd like to see this one though." 
Seas of light glared at them in one solid blaze wherever they looked. 
"Very pretty," said Zaphod petulantly. 
In the sky a huge green catalogue number appeared. It flickered and changed, and when they looked around again so had the land. 
As with one voice they all went, "Yuch." 
The sea was purple. The beach they were on was composed of tiny yellow and green pebbles presumably terribly precious stones. The mountains in the distance seemed soft and undulating with red peaks. Nearby stood a solid silver beach table with a frilly mauve parasol and silver tassles. 
In the sky a huge sign appeared, replacing the catalogue number. It said, Whatever your tastes, Magrathea can cater for you. We are not proud. 
And five hundred entirely naked women dropped out of the sky on parachutes. 
In a moment the scene vanished and left them in a springtime meadow full of cows. 
"Ow!" said Zaphod. "My brains!"â¨"You want to talk about it?" said Ford. 
"Yeah, OK," said Zaphod, and all three sat down and ignored the scenes that came and went around them. 
"I figure this," said Zaphod. "Whatever happened to my mind, I did it. And I did it in such a way that it wouldn't be detected by the government screening tests. And I wasn't to know anything about it myself. Pretty crazy, right?" 
The other two nodded in agreement. 
"So I reckon, what's so secret that I can't let anybody know I know it, not the Galactic Government, not even myself? And the answer is I don't know. Obviously. But I put a few things together and I can begin to guess. When did I decide to run for President? Shortly after the death of President Yooden Vranx. You remember Yooden, Ford?" 
"Yeah," said Ford, "he was that guy we met when we were kids, the Arcturan captain. He was a gas. He gave us conkers when you bust your way into his megafreighter. Said you were the most amazing kid he'd ever met." 
"What's all this?" said Trillian. 
"Ancient history," said Ford, "when we were kids together on Betelgeuse. The Arcturan megafreighters used to carry most of the bulky trade between the Galactic Centre and the outlying regions The Betelgeuse trading scouts used to find the markets and the Arcturans would supply them. There was a lot of trouble with space pirates before they were wiped out in the Dordellis wars, and the megafreighters had to be equipped with the most fantastic defence shields known to Galactic science. They were real brutes of ships, and huge. In orbit round a planet they would eclipse the sun. 
"One day, young Zaphod here decides to raid one. On a tri-jet scooter designed for stratosphere work, a mere kid. I mean forget it, it was crazier than a mad monkey. I went along for the ride because I'd got some very safe money on him not doing it, and didn't want him coming back with fake evidence. So what happens? We got in his tri- jet which he had souped up into something totally other, crossed three parsecs in a matter of weeks, bust our way into a megafreighter I still don't know how, marched on to the bridge waving toy pistols and demanded conkers. A wilder thing I have not known. Lost me a year's pocket money. For what? Conkers." 
"The captain was this really amazing guy, Yooden Vranx," said Zaphod. "He gave us food, booze stuff from really weird parts of the 
Galaxy lots of conkers of course, and we had just the most incredible time. Then he teleported us back. Into the maximum security wing of Betelgeuse state prison. He was a cool guy. Went on to become President of the Galaxy." 
Zaphod paused. 
The scene around them was currently plunged into gloom. Dark mists swirled round them and elephantine shapes lurked indistinctly in the shadows. The air was occasionally rent with the sounds of illusory beings murdering other illusory beings. Presumably enough people must have liked this sort of thing to make it a paying proposition. 
"Ford," said Zaphod quietly. 
"Yeah?" 
"Just before Yooden died he came to see me." 
"What? You never told me." 
"No." 
"What did he say? What did he come to see you about?" 
"He told me about the Heart of Gold. It was his idea that I should steal it." 
"His idea?" 
"Yeah," said Zaphod, "and the only possible way of stealing it was to be at the launching ceremony." 
Ford gaped at him in astonishment for a moment, and then roared with laughter. 
"Are you telling me," he said, "that you set yourself up to become President of the Galaxy just to steal that ship?" 
"That's it," said Zaphod with the sort of grin that would get most people locked away in a room with soft walls. 
"But why?" said Ford. "What's so important about having it?" 
"Dunno," said Zaphod, "I think if I'd consciously known what was so important about it and what I would need it for it would have showed up on the brain screening tests and I would never have passed. I think Yooden told me a lot of things that are still locked away." 
"So you think you went and mucked about inside your own brain as a result of Yooden talking to you?" 
"He was a hell of a talker." 
"Yeah, but Zaphod old mate, you want to look after yourself you know." 
Zaphod shrugged. 
"I mean, don't you have any inkling of the reasons for all this?" asked Ford. 
Zaphod thought hard about this and doubts seemed to cross his minds. 
"No," he said at last, "I don't seem to be letting myself into any of my secrets. Still," he added on further reflection, "I can understand that. I wouldn't trust myself further than I could spit a rat." 
A moment later, the last planet in the catalogue vanished from beneath them and the solid world resolved itself again. 
They were sitting in a plush waiting room full of glass-top tables and design awards. 
A tall Magrathean man was standing in front of them. "The mice will see you now," he said. 
Chapter 30 
"So there you have it," said Slartibartfast, making a feeble and perfunctory attempt to clear away some of the appalling mess of his study. He picked up a paper from the top of a pile, but then couldn't think of anywhere else to put it, so he but it back on top of the original pile which promptly fell over. "Deep Thought designed the Earth, we built it and you lived on it." 
"And the Vogons came and destroyed it five minutes before the program was completed," added Arthur, not unbitterly. 
"Yes," said the old man, pausing to gaze hopelessly round the room. "Ten million years of planning and work gone just like that. Tenâ¨million years, Earthman... can you conceive of that kind of time span? A galactic civilization could grow from a single worm five times over in that time. Gone." He paused. 
"Well that's bureaucracy for you," he added. 
"You know," said Arthur thoughtfully, "all this explains a lot of things. All through my life I've had this strange unaccountable feeling that something was going on in the world, something big, even sinister, and no one would tell me what it was." 
"No," said the old man, "that's just perfectly normal paranoia. Everyone in the Universe has that." 
"Everyone?" said Arthur. "Well, if everyone has that perhaps it means something! Perhaps somewhere outside the Universe we know..." 
"Maybe. Who cares?" said Slartibartfast before Arthur got too excited. "Perhaps I'm old and tired," he continued, "but I always think that the chances of finding out what really is going on are so absurdly remote that the only thing to do is to say hang the sense of it and just keep yourself occupied. Look at me: I design coastlines. I got an award for Norway." 
He rummaged around in a pile of debris and pulled out a large perspex block with his name on it and a model of Norway moulded into it. 
"Where's the sense in that?" he said. "None that I've been able to make out. I've been doing fjords in all my life. For a fleeting moment they become fashionable and I get a major award." 
He turned it over in his hands with a shrug and tossed it aside carelessly, but not so carelessly that it didn't land on something soft. 
"In this replacement Earth we're building they've given me Africa to do and of course I'm doing it with all fjords again because I happen to like them, and I'm old fashioned enough to think that they give a lovely baroque feel to a continent. And they tell me it's not equatorial enough. Equatorial!" He gave a hollow laugh. "What does it matter? Science has achieved some wonderful things of course, but I'd far rather be happy than right any day." 
"And are you?" 
"No. That's where it all falls down of course." 
"Pity," said Arthur with sympathy. "It sounded like quite a good lifestyle otherwise." 
Somewhere on the wall a small white light flashed. 
"Come," said Slartibartfast, "you are to meet the mice. Your arrival on the planet has caused considerable excitement. It has already been hailed, so I gather, as the third most improbable event in the history of the Universe." 
"What were the first two?" 
"Oh, probably just coincidences," said Slartibartfast carelessly. He opened the door and stood waiting for Arthur to follow. 
Arthur glanced around him once more, and then down at himself, at the sweaty dishevelled clothes he had been lying in the mud in on Thursday morning. 
"I seem to be having tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle," he muttered to himself. 
"I beg your pardon?" said the old man mildly. "Oh nothing," said Arthur, "only joking." 
Chapter 31 
It is of course well known that careless talk costs lives, but the full scale of the problem is not always appreciated. 
For instance, at the very moment that Arthur said "I seem to be having tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle," a freak wormhole opened up in the fabric of the space-time continuum and carried his words far far back in time across almost infinite reaches of space to a distant Galaxy where strange and warlike beings were poised on the brink of frightful interstellar battle. 
The two opposing leaders were meeting for the last time. 
A dreadful silence fell across the conference table as the commander of the Vl'hurgs, resplendent in his black jewelled battle shorts, gazed levelly at the G'Gugvuntt leader squatting opposite him in a cloud of green sweet-smelling steam, and, with a million sleek and horribly beweaponed star cruisers poised to unleash electric death at his single word of command, challenged the vile creature to take back what it had said about his mother. 
The creature stirred in his sickly broiling vapour, and at that very moment the words I seem to be having tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle drifted across the conference table. 
Unfortunately, in the Vl'hurg tongue this was the most dreadful insult imaginable, and there was nothing for it but to wage terrible war for centuries. 
Eventually of course, after their Galaxy had been decimated over a few thousand years, it was realized that the whole thing had been a ghastly mistake, and so the two opposing battle fleets settled their few remaining differences in order to launch a joint attack on our own Galaxy now positively identified as the source of the offending remark. 
For thousands more years the mighty ships tore across the empty wastes of space and finally dived screaming on to the first planet they came across which happened to be the Earth where due to a 
terrible miscalculation of scale the entire battle fleet was accidentally swallowed by a small dog. 
Those who study the complex interplay of cause and effect in the history of the Universe say that this sort of thing is going on all the time, but that we are powerless to prevent it. 
"It's just life," they say. 
A short aircar trip brought Arthur and the old Magrathean to a doorway. They left the car and went through the door into a waiting room full of glass-topped tables and perspex awards. Almost immediately, a light flashed above the door at the other side of the room and they entered. 
"Arthur! You're safe!" a voice cried. 
"Am I?" said Arthur, rather startled. "Oh good." 
The lighting was rather subdued and it took him a moment or so to see Ford, Trillian and Zaphod sitting round a large table beautifully decked out with exotic dishes, strange sweetmeats and bizarre fruits. They were stuffing their faces. 
"What happened to you?" demanded Arthur. 
"Well," said Zaphod, attacking a boneful of grilled muscle, "our hosts here have been gassing us and zapping our minds and being generally weird and have now given us a rather nice meal to make it up to us. Here," he said hoiking out a lump of evil smelling meat from a bowl, "have some Vegan Rhino's cutlet. It's delicious if you happen to like that sort of thing." 
"Hosts?" said Arthur. "What hosts? I don't see any..." 
A small voice said, "Welcome to lunch, Earth creature." 
Arthur glanced around and suddenly yelped. 
"Ugh!" he said. "There are mice on the table!" 
There was an awkward silence as everyone looked pointedly at Arthur. 
He was busy staring at two white mice sitting in what looked like whisky glasses on the table. He heard the silence and glanced around at everyone. 
"Oh!" he said, with sudden realization. "Oh, I'm sorry, I wasn't quite prepared for..." 
"Let me introduce you," said Trillian. "Arthur this is Benji mouse." 
"Hi," said one of the mice. His whiskers stroked what must have been a touch sensitive panel on the inside of the whisky-glass like affair, and it moved forward slightly. 
"And this is Frankie mouse." 
The other mouse said, "Pleased to meet you," and did likewise. 
Arthur gaped. 
"But aren't they..." 
"Yes," said Trillian, "they are the mice I brought with me from the Earth." 
She looked him in the eye and Arthur thought he detected the tiniest resigned shrug. 
"Could you pass me that bowl of grated Arcturan Megadonkey?" she said. 
Slartibartfast coughed politely. 
"Er, excuse me," he said. 
"Yes, thank you Slartibartfast," said Benji mouse sharply, "you may go." 
"What? Oh... er, very well," said the old man, slightly taken aback, "I'll just go and get on with some of my fjords then." 
"Ah, well in fact that won't be necessary," said Frankie mouse. "It looks very much as if we won't be needing the new Earth any longer." He swivelled his pink little eyes. "Not now that we have found a native of the planet who was there seconds before it was destroyed." 
"What?" cried Slartibartfast, aghast. "You can't mean that! I've got a thousand glaciers poised and ready to roll over Africa!" 
"Well perhaps you can take a quick skiing holiday before you dismantle them," said Frankie, acidly. 
"Skiing holiday!" cried the old man. "Those glaciers are works of art! Elegantly sculptured contours, soaring pinnacles of ice, deep majestic ravines! It would be sacrilege to go skiing on high art!" 
"Thank you Slartibartfast," said Benji firmly. "That will be all." 
"Yes sir," said the old man coldly, "thank you very much. Well, goodbye Earthman," he said to Arthur, "hope the lifestyle comes together." 
With a brief nod to the rest of the company he turned and walked sadly out of the room. 
Arthur stared after him not knowing what to say. "Now," said Benji mouse, "to business."â¨Ford and Zaphod clinked their glasses together. "To business!" they said. 
"I beg your pardon?" said Benji.â¨Ford looked round.â¨"Sorry, I thought you were proposing a toast," he said. 
The two mice scuttled impatiently around in their glass transports. Finally they composed themselves, and Benji moved forward to address Arthur. 
"Now, Earth creature," he said, "the situation we have in effect is this. We have, as you know, been more or less running your planet for the last ten million years in order to find this wretched thing called the Ultimate Question." 
"Why?" said Arthur, sharply. 
"No we already thought of that one," said Frankie interrupting, "but it doesn't fit the answer. Why? Forty-Two... you see, it doesn't work." 
"No," said Arthur, "I mean why have you been doing it?" 
"Oh, I see," said Frankie. "Well, eventually just habit I think, to be brutally honest. And this is more or less the point we're sick to the teeth with the whole thing, and the prospect of doing it all over again on account of those whinnet-ridden Vogons quite frankly gives me the screaming heeby jeebies, you know what I mean? It was by the merest lucky chance that Benji and I finished our particular job and left the planet early for a quick holiday, and have since manipulated our way back to Magrathea by the good offices of your friends." 
"Magrathea is a gateway back to our own dimension," put in Benji. 
"Since when," continued his murine colleague, "we have had an offer of a quite enormously fat contract to do the 5D chat show and lecture circuit back in our own dimensional neck of the woods, and we're very much inclined to take it." 
"I would, wouldn't you Ford?" said Zaphod promptingly. "Oh yes," said Ford, "jump at it, like a shot." 
Arthur glanced at them, wondering what all this was leading up to. 
"But we've got to have a product you see," said Frankie, "I mean ideally we still need the Ultimate Question in some form or other." 
Zaphod leaned forward to Arthur. 
"You see," he said, "if they're just sitting there in the studio looking very relaxed and, you know, just mentioning that they happen to know the Answer to Life, the Universe and Everything, and then eventually have to admit that in fact it's Forty-two, then the show's probably quite short. No follow-up, you see." 
"We have to have something that sounds good," said Benji. 
"Something that sounds good?" exclaimed Arthur. "An Ultimate Question that sounds good? From a couple of mice?" 
The mice bristled. 
"Well, I mean, yes idealism, yes the dignity of pure research, yes the pursuit of truth in all its forms, but there comes a point I'm afraid where you begin to suspect that if there's any real truth, it's that the entire multi-dimensional infinity of the Universe is almost certainly being run by a bunch of maniacs. And if it comes to a choice between spending yet another ten million years finding that out, and on the other hand just taking the money and running, then I for one could do with the exercise," said Frankie. 
"But..." started Arthur, hopelessly. 
"Hey, will you get this, Earthman," interrupted Zaphod. "You are a last generation product of that computer matrix, right, and you were there right up to the moment your planet got the finger, yeah?" 
"Er..." 
"So your brain was an organic part of the penultimate configuration of the computer programme," said Ford, rather lucidly he thought. 
"Right?" said Zaphod. 
"Well," said Arthur doubtfully. He wasn't aware of ever having felt an organic part of anything. He had always seen this as one of his problems. 
"In other words," said Benji, steering his curious little vehicle right over to Arthur, "there's a good chance that the structure of the question is encoded in the structure of your brain so we want to buy it off you." 
"What, the question?" said Arthur.â¨"Yes," said Ford and Trillian.â¨"For lots of money," said Zaphod.â¨"No, no," said Frankie, "it's the brain we want to buy." "What!" 
"I thought you said you could just read his brain electronically," protested Ford. 
"Oh yes," said Frankie, "but we'd have to get it out first. It's got to be prepared." 
"Treated," said Benji. 
"Diced." 
"Thank you," shouted Arthur, tipping up his chair and backing away from the table in horror. 
"It could always be replaced," said Benji reasonably, "if you think it's important." 
"Yes, an electronic brain," said Frankie, "a simple one would suffice." 
"A simple one!" wailed Arthur. 
"Yeah," said Zaphod with a sudden evil grin, "you'd just have to program it to say What? and I don't understand and Where's the tea? who'd know the difference?" 
"What?" cried Arthur, backing away still further. 
"See what I mean?" said Zaphod and howled with pain because of something that Trillian did at that moment. 
"I'd notice the difference," said Arthur. 
"No you wouldn't," said Frankie mouse, "you'd be programmed not to." 
Ford made for the door. 
"Look, I'm sorry, mice old lads," he said. "I don't think we've got a deal." 
"I rather think we have to have a deal," said the mice in chorus, all the charm vanishing fro their piping little voices in an instant. With a tiny whining shriek their two glass transports lifted themselves off the table, and swung through the air towards Arthur, who stumbled further backwards into a blind corner, utterly unable to cope or think of anything. 
Trillian grabbed him desperately by the arm and tried to drag him towards the door, which Ford and Zaphod were struggling to open, but Arthur was dead weight he seemed hypnotized by the airborne rodents swooping towards him. 
She screamed at him, but he just gaped. 
With one more yank, Ford and Zaphod got the door open. On the other side of it was a small pack of rather ugly men who they could only assume were the heavy mob of Magrathea. Not only were they ugly themselves, but the medical equipment they carried with them was also far from pretty. They charged. 
So Arthur was about to have his head cut open, Trillian was unable to help him, and Ford and Zaphod were about to be set upon by several thugs a great deal heavier and more sharply armed than they were. 
All in all it was extremely fortunate that at that moment every alarm on the planet burst into an earsplitting din. 
Chapter 32 
"Emergency! Emergency!" blared the klaxons throughout Magrathea. "Hostile ship has landed on planet. Armed intruders in section 8A. Defence stations, defence stations!" 
The two mice sniffed irritably round the fragments of their glass transports where they lay shattered on the floor. 
"Damnation," muttered Frankie mouse, "all that fuss over two pounds of Earthling brain." He scuttled round and about, his pink eyes flashing, his fine white coat bristling with static. 
"The only thing we can do now," said Benji, crouching and stroking his whiskers in thought, "is to try and fake a question, invent one that will sound plausible." 
"Difficult," said Frankie. He thought. "How about What's yellow and dangerous?" 
Benji considered this for a moment. 
"No, no good," he said. "Doesn't fit the answer." 
They sank into silence for a few seconds. 
"Alright," said Benji. "What do you get if you multiply six by seven?" 
"No, no, too literal, too factual," said Frankie, "wouldn't sustain the punters' interest." 
Again they thought. 
Then Frankie said: "Here's a thought. How many roads must a man walk down?" 
"Ah," said Benji. "Aha, now that does sound promising!" He rolled the phrase around a little. "Yes," he said, "that's excellent! Sounds very significant without actually tying you down to meaning anything at all. How many roads must a man walk down? Forty-two. Excellent, excellent, that'll fox 'em. Frankie baby, we are made!" 
They performed a scampering dance in their excitement. 
Near them on the floor lay several rather ugly men who had been hit about the head with some heavy design awards. 
Half a mile away, four figures pounded up a corridor looking for a way out. They emerged into a wide open-plan computer bay. They glanced about wildly. 
"Which way do you reckon Zaphod?" said Ford. 
"At a wild guess, I'd say down here," said Zaphod, running off down to the right between a computer bank and the wall. As the others started after him he was brought up short by a Kill-O-Zap energy bolt that cracked through the air inches in front of him and fried a small section of adjacent wall. 
A voice on a loud hailer said, "OK Beeblebrox, hold it right there. We've got you covered." 
"Cops!" hissed Zaphod, and span around in a crouch. "You want to try a guess at all, Ford?" 
"OK, this way," said Ford, and the four of them ran down a gangway between two computer banks. 
At the end of the gangway appeared a heavily armoured and space-suited figure waving a vicious Kill-O-Zap gun. 
"We don't want to shoot you, Beeblebrox!" shouted the figure. 
"Suits me fine!" shouted Zaphod back and dived down a wide gap between two data process units. 
The others swerved in behind him. 
"There are two of them," said Trillian. "We're cornered." 
They squeezed themselves down in an angle between a large computer data bank and the wall. 
They held their breath and waited. 
Suddenly the air exploded with energy bolts as both the cops opened fire on them simultaneously. 
"Hey, they're shooting at us," said Arthur, crouching in a tight ball, "I thought they said they didn't want to do that." 
"Yeah, I thought they said that," agreed Ford. 
Zaphod stuck a head up for a dangerous moment. 
"Hey," he said, "I thought you said you didn't want to shoot us!" and ducked again. 
They waited. 
After a moment a voice replied, "It isn't easy being a cop!" "What did he say?" whispered Ford in astonishment.â¨"He said it isn't easy being a cop."â¨"Well surely that's his problem isn't it?" 
"I'd have thought so." 
Ford shouted out, "Hey listen! I think we've got enough problems on our own having you shooting at us, so if you could avoid laying your problems on us as well, I think we'd all find it easier to cope!" 
Another pause, and then the loud hailer again. 
"Now see here, guy," said the voice on the loud hailer, "you're not dealing with any dumb two-bit trigger-pumping morons with low hairlines, little piggy eyes and no conversation, we're a couple of intelligent caring guys that you'd probably quite like if you met us socially! I don't go around gratuitously shooting people and then bragging about it afterwards in seedy space-rangers bars, like some cops I could mention! I go around shooting people gratuitously and then I agonize about it afterwards for hours to my girlfriend!" 
"And I write novels!" chimed in the other cop. "Though I haven't had any of them published yet, so I better warn you, I'm in a meeeean mood!" 
Ford's eyes popped halfway out of their sockets. "Who are these guys?" he said. 
"Dunno," said Zaphod, "I think I preferred it when they were shooting." 
"So are you going to come quietly," shouted one of the cops again, "or are you going to let us blast you out?" 
"Which would you prefer?" shouted Ford. 
A millisecond later the air about them started to fry again, as bolt after bolt of Kill-O-Zap hurled itself into the computer bank in front of them. 
The fusillade continued for several seconds at unbearable intensity. 
When it stopped, there were a few seconds of near quietness ad the echoes died away. 
"You still there?" called one of the cops.â¨"Yes," they called back.â¨"We didn't enjoy doing that at all," shouted the other cop. 
"We could tell," shouted Ford.â¨"Now, listen to this, Beeblebrox, and you better listen good!" "Why?" shouted Back Zaphod. 
"Because," shouted the cop, "it's going to be very intelligent, and quite interesting and humane! Now either you all give yourselves up now and let us beat you up a bit, though not very much of course because we are firmly opposed to needless violence, or we blow up this entire planet and possibly one or two others we noticed on our way out here!" 
"But that's crazy!" cried Trillian. "You wouldn't do that!" 
"Oh yes we would," shouted the cop, "wouldn't we?" he asked the other one. 
"Oh yes, we'd have to, no question," the other one called back. 
"But why?" demanded Trillian. 
"Because there are some things you have to do even if you are an enlightened liberal cop who knows all about sensitivity and everything!" 
"I just don't believe these guys," muttered Ford, shaking his head. 
One cop shouted to the other, "Shall we shoot them again for a bit?" 
"Yeah, why not?" 
They let fly another electric barrage. 
The heat and noise was quite fantastic. Slowly, the computer bank was beginning to disintegrate. The front had almost all melted away, and thick rivulets of molten metal were winding their way back towards where they were squatting. They huddled further back and waited for the end. 
Chapter 33 
But the end never came, at least not then. 
Quite suddenly the barrage stopped, and the sudden silence afterwards was punctuated by a couple of strangled gurgles and thuds. 
The four stared at each other.â¨"What happened?" said Arthur.â¨"They stopped," said Zaphod with a shrug.â¨"Why?"â¨"Dunno, do you want to go and ask them?"â¨"No."â¨They waited.â¨"Hello?" called out Ford.â¨No answer.â¨"That's odd."â¨"Perhaps it's a trap."â¨"They haven't the wit."â¨"What were those thuds?"â¨"Dunno."â¨They waited for a few more seconds.â¨"Right," said Ford, "I'm going to have a look."â¨He glanced round at the others.â¨"Is no one going to say, No you can't possibly, let me go instead?" They all shook their heads.â¨"Oh well," he said, and stood up.â¨For a moment, nothing happened. 
Then, after a second or so, nothing continued to happen. Ford peered through the thick smoke that was billowing out of the burning computer. 
Cautiously he stepped out into the open. 
Still nothing happened. 
Twenty yards away he could dimly see through the smoke the space-suited figure of one of the cops. He was lying in a crumpled heap on the ground. Twenty yards in the other direction lay the second man. No one else was anywhere to be seen. 
This struck Ford as being extremely odd. 
Slowly, nervously, he walked towards the first one. The body lay reassuringly still as he approached it, and continued to lie reassuringly still as he reached it and put his foot down on the Kill-O-Zap gun that still dangled from its limp fingers. 
He reached down and picked it up, meeting no resistance. 
The cop was quite clearly dead. 
A quick examination revealed him to be from Blagulon Kappa he was a methane-breathing life form, dependent on his space suit for survival in the thin oxygen atmosphere of Magrathea. 
The tiny life-support system computer on his backpack appeared unexpectedly to have blown up. 
Ford poked around in it in considerable astonishment. These miniature suit computers usually had the full back-up of the main computer back on the ship, with which they were directly linked through the sub-etha. Such a system was fail-safe in all circumstances other than total feedback malfunction, which was unheard of. 
He hurried over to the other prone figure, and discovered that exactly the same impossible thing had happened to him, presumably simultaneously. 
He called the others over to look. They came, shared his astonishment, but not his curiosity. 
"Let's get shot out of this hole," said Zaphod. "If whatever I'm supposed to be looking for is here, I don't want it." He grabbed the second Kill-O-Zap gun, blasted a perfectly harmless accounting computer and rushed out into the corridor, followed by the others. He very nearly blasted hell out of an aircar that stood waiting for them a few yards away. 
The aircar was empty, but Arthur recognized it as belonging to Slartibartfast. 
It had a note from him pinned to part of its sparse instrument panel. The note had an arrow drawn on it, pointing at one of the controls. 
It said, This is probably the best button to press. 
Chapter 34 
The aircar rocketed them at speeds in excess of R17 through the steel tunnels that lead out onto the appalling surface of the planet which was now in the grip of yet another drear morning twilight. Ghastly grey lights congealed on the land. 
R is a velocity measure, defined as a reasonable speed of travel that is consistent with health, mental wellbeing and not being more than say five minutes late. It is therefore clearly an almost infinitely variable figure according to circumstances, since the first two factors vary not only with speed taken as an absolute, but also with awareness of the third factor. Unless handled with tranquility this equation can result in considerable stress, ulcers and even death. 
R17 is not a fixed velocity, but it is clearly far too fast. 
The aircar flung itself through the air at R17 and above, deposited them next to the Heart of Gold which stood starkly on the frozen ground like a bleached bone, and then precipitately hurled itself back in the direction whence they had come, presumably on important business of its own. 
Shivering, the four of them stood and looked at the ship. 
Beside it stood another one. 
It was the Blagulon Kappa policecraft, a bulbous sharklike affair, slate green in colour and smothered with black stencilled letters of varying degrees of size and unfriendliness. The letters informed anyone who cared to read them as to where the ship was from, what section of the police it was assigned to, and where the power feeds should be connected. 
It seemed somehow unnaturally dark and silent, even for a ship whose two-man crew was at that moment lying asphyxicated in a smoke-filled chamber several miles beneath the ground. It is one of those curious things that is impossible to explain or define, but one can sense when a ship is completely dead. 
Ford could sense it and found it most mysterious a ship and two policemen seemed to have gone spontaneously dead. In his experience the Universe simply didn't work like that. 
The other three could sense it too, but they could sense the bitter cold even more and hurried back into the Heart of Gold suffering from an acute attack of no curiosity. 
Ford stayed, and went to examine the Blagulon ship. As he walked, he nearly tripped over an inert steel figure lying face down in the cold dust. 
"Marvin!" he exclaimed. "What are you doing?" 
"Don't feel you have to take any notice of me, please," came a muffled drone. 
"But how are you, metalman?" said Ford. 
"Very depressed." 
"What's up?" 
"I don't know," said Marvin, "I've never been there." 
"Why," said Ford squatting down beside him and shivering, "are you lying face down in the dust?" 
"It's a very effective way of being wretched," said Marvin. "Don't pretend you want to talk to me, I know you hate me." 
"No I don't." 
"Yes you do, everybody does. It's part of the shape of the Universe. I only have to talk to somebody and they begin to hate me. Even robots hate me. If you just ignore me I expect I shall probably go away." 
He jacked himself up to his feet and stood resolutely facing the opposite direction. 
"That ship hated me," he said dejectedly, indicating the policecraft. 
"That ship?" said Ford in sudden excitement. "What happened to it? Do you know?" 
"It hated me because I talked to it." 
"You talked to it?" exclaimed Ford. "What do you mean you talked to it?" 
"Simple. I got very bored and depressed, so I went and plugged myself in to its external computer feed. I talked to the computer at great length and explained my view of the Universe to it," said Marvin. 
"And what happened?" pressed Ford. 
"It committed suicide," said Marvin and stalked off back to the Heart of Gold. 
Chapter 35 
That night, as the Heart of Gold was busy putting a few light years between itself and the Horsehead Nebula, Zaphod lounged under the small palm tree on the bridge trying to bang his brain into shape with massive Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters; Ford and Trillian sat in a corner discussing life and matters arising from it; and Arthur took to his bed to flip through Ford's copy of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Since he was going to live in the place, he reasoned, he'd better start finding out something about it. 
He came across this entry. 
It said: 'The History of every major Galactic Civilization tends to pass through three distinct and recognizable phases, those of Survival, Inquiry and Sophistication, otherwise known as the How, Why and Where phases." 
"For instance, the first phase is characterized by the question How can we eat? the second by the question Why do we eat? and the third by the question Where shall we have lunch?" 
He got no further before the ship's intercom buzzed into life. "Hey Earthman? You hungry kid?" said Zaphod's voice.â¨"Er, well yes, a little peckish I suppose," said Arthur. 
"OK baby, hold tight," said Zaphod. "We'll take in a quick bite at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe."

There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. 
There is another theory which states that this has already happened. 
Chapter 1 
The story so far: 
In the beginning the Universe was created. 
This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move. 
Many races believe that it was created by some sort of God, though the Jatravartid people of Viltvodle VI believe that the entire Universe was in fact sneezed out of the nose of a being called the Great Green Arkleseizure. 
The Jatravartids, who live in perpetual fear of the time they call The Coming of The Great White Handkerchief, are small blue creatures with more than fifty arms each, who are therefore unique in being the only race in history to have invented the aerosol deodorant before the wheel. 
However, the Great Green Arkleseizure Theory is not widely accepted outside Viltvodle VI and so, the Universe being the puzzling place it is, other explanations are constantly being sought. 
For instance, a race of hyperintelligent pan-dimensional beings once built themselves a gigantic supercomputer called Deep Thought to calculate once and for all the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything. 
For seven and a half million years, Deep Thought computed and calculated, and in the end announced that the answer was in fact Forty-two-and so another, even bigger, computer had to be built to find out what the actual question was. 
And this computer, which was called the Earth, was so large that it was frequently mistaken for a planet especially by the strange ape- like beings who roamed its surface, totally unaware that they were simply part of a gigantic computer program. 
And this is very odd, because without that fairly simple and obvious piece of knowledge, nothing that ever happened on the Earth could possibly make the slightest bit of sense. 
Sadly however, just before the critical moment of readout, the Earth was unexpectedly demolished by the Vogons to make way so they claimed for a new hyperspace bypass, and so all hope of discovering a meaning for life was lost for ever. 
Or so it would seem. 
Two of there strange, ape-like creatures survived. 
Arthur Dent escaped at the very last moment because an old friend of his, Ford Prefect, suddenly turned out to be from a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and not from Guildford as he had hitherto claimed; and, more to the point, he knew how to hitch rides on flying saucers. 
Tricia McMillian or Trillian had skipped the planet six months earlier with Zaphod Beeblebrox, the then President of the Galaxy. 
Two survivors. 
They are all that remains of the greatest experiment ever conducted to find the Ultimate Question and the Ultimate Answer of Life, the Universe, and Everything. 
And, less than half a million miles from where their starship is drifting lazily through the inky blackness of space, a Vogon ship is moving slowly towards them. 
Chapter 2 
Like all Vogon ships it looked as if it had been not so much designed as congealed. The unpleasant yellow lumps and edifices which protuded from it at unsightly angles would have disfigured the looks of most ships, but in this case that was sadly impossible. Uglier things have been spotted in the skies, but not by reliable witnesses. 
In fact to see anything much uglier than a Vogon ship you would have to go inside and look at a Vogon. If you are wise, however, this is precisely what you will avoid doing because the average Vogon will not think twice before doing something so pointlessly hideous to you that you will wish you had never been born or (if you are a clearer minded thinker) that the Vogon had never been born. 
In fact, the average Vogon probably wouldn't even think once. They are simple-minded, thick-willed, slug-brained creatures, and thinking is not really something they are cut out for. Anatomical analysis of the Vogon reveals that its brain was originally a badly deformed, misplaced and dyspeptic liver. The fairest thing you can say about them, then, is that they know what they like, and what they like generally involves hurting people and, wherever possible, getting very angry. 
One thing they don't like is leaving a job unfinished particularly this Vogon, and particularly for various reasons this job. 
This Vogon was Captain Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic Hyperspace Planning Council, and he was it who had had the job of demolishing the so-called "planet" Earth. 
He heaved his monumentally vile body round in his ill-fitting, slimy seat and stared at the monitor screen on which the starship Heart of Gold was being systematically scanned. 
It mattered little to him that the Heart of Gold, with its Infinite Improbability Drive, was the most beautiful and revolutionary ship ever built. Aesthetics and technology were closed books to him and, had he had his way, burnt and buried books as well. 
It mattered even less to him that Zaphod Beeblebrox was aboard. Zaphod Beeblebrox was now the ex-President of the Galaxy, and though every police force in the Galaxy was currently pursuing both him and this ship he had stolen, the Vogon was not interested. 
He had other fish to fry. 
It has been said that Vogons are not above a little bribery and corruption in the same way that the sea is not above the clouds, and this was certainly true in his case. When he heard the words "integrity" or "moral rectitude", he reached for his dictionary, and when he heard the chink of ready money in large quantities he reached for the rule book and threw it away. 
In seeking so implacably the destruction of the Earth and all that therein lay he was moving somewhat above and beyond the call of his professional duty. There was even some doubt as to whether the said bypass was actually going to be built, but the matter had been glossed over. 
He grunted a repellent grunt of satisfaction. 
"Computer," he croaked, "get me my brain care specialist on the line." 
Within a few seconds the face of Gag Halfrunt appeared on the screen, smiling the smile of a man who knew he was ten light years away from the Vogon face he was looking at. Mixed up somewhere in the smile was a glint of irony too. Though the Vogon persistently referred to him as "my private brain care specialist" there was not a lot of brain to take care of, and it was in fact Halfrunt who was employing the Vogon. He was paying him an awful lot of money to do some very dirty work. As one of the Galaxy's most prominent and successful psychiatrists, he and a consortium of his colleagues were quite prepared to spend an awful lot of money when it seemed that the entire future of psychiatry might be at stake. 
"Well," he said, "hello my Captain of Vogons Prostetnic, and how are we feeling today?" 
The Vogon captain told him that in the last few hours he had wiped out nearly half his crew in a disciplinary exercise. 
Halfrunt's smile did not flicker for an instant. 
"Well," he said, "I think this is perfectly normal behaviour for a Vogon, you know? The natural and healthy channelling of the aggressive instincts into acts of senseless violence." 
"That," rumbled the Vogon, "is what you always say." 
"Well again," said Halfrunt, "I think that this is perfectly normal behaviour for a psychiatrist. Good. We are clearly both very well adjusted in our mental attitudes today. Now tell me, what news of the mission?" 
"We have located the ship." 
"Wonderful," said Halfrunt, "wonderful! and the occupants?" 
"The Earthman is there." 
"Excellent! And...?" 
"A female from the same planet. They are the last." 
"Good, good," beamed Halfrunt, "Who else?" 
"The man Prefect." 
"Yes?" 
"And Zaphod Beeblebrox." 
For an instant Halfrunt's smile flickered. 
"Ah yes," he said, "I had been expecting this. It is most regrettable." 
"A personal friend?" inquired the Vogon, who had heard the expression somewhere once and decided to try it out. 
"Ah, no," said Halfrunt, "in my profession you know, we do not make personal friends." 
"Ah," grunted the Vogon, "professional detachment." 
"No," said Halfrunt cheerfully, "we just don't have the knack." 
He paused. His mouth continued to smile, but his eyes frowned slightly. 
"But Beeblebrox, you know," he said, "he is one of my most profitable clients. He had personality problems beyond the dreams of analysts." 
He toyed with this thought a little before reluctantly dismissing it. "Still," he said, "you are ready for your task?"â¨"Yes."â¨"Good. Destroy the ship immediately." 
"What about Beeblebrox?" 
"Well," said Halfrunt brightly, "Zaphod's just this guy, you know?" 
He vanished from the screen. 
The Vogon Captain pressed a communicator button which connected him with the remains of his crew. 
"Attack," he said. 
At that precise moment Zaphod Beeblebrox was in his cabin swearing very loudly. Two hours ago, he had said that they would go for a quick bite at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, whereupon he had had a blazing row with the ship's computer and stormed off to his cabin shouting that he would work out the Improbability factors with a pencil. 
The Heart of Gold's Improbability Drive made it the most powerful and unpredictable ship in existence. There was nothing it couldn't do, provided you knew exactly how improbable it was that the thing you wanted it to do would ever happen. 
He had stolen it when, as President, he was meant to be launching it. He didn't know exactly why he had stolen it, except that he liked it. 
He didn't know why he had become President of the Galaxy, except that it seemed a fun thing to be. 
He did know that there were better reasons than these, but that they were buried in a dark, locked off section of his two brains. He wished the dark, locked off section of his two brains would go away because they occasionally surfaced momentarily and put strange thoughts into the light, fun sections of his mind and tried to deflect him from what he saw as being the basic business of his life, which was to have a wonderfully good time. 
At the moment he was not having a wonderfully good time. He had run out of patience and pencils and was feeling very hungry. 
"Starpox!" he shouted. 
At that same precise moment, Ford Prefect was in mid air. This was not because of anything wrong with the ship's artificial gravity field, but because he was leaping down the stair-well which led to the ship's personal cabins. It was a very high jump to do in one bound and he landed awkwardly, stumbled, recovered, raced down the corridor 
sending a couple of miniature service robots flying, skidded round the corner, burst into Zaphod's door and explained what was on his mind. 
"Vogons," he said. 
A short while before this, Arthur Dent had set out from his cabin in search of a cup of tea. It was not a quest he embarked upon with a great deal of optimism., because he knew that the only source of hot drinks on the entire ship was a benighted piece of equipment produced by the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation. It was called a Nutri- Matic Drinks Synthesizer, and he had encountered it before. 
It claimed to produce the widest possible range of drinks personally matched to the tastes and metabolism of whoever cared to use it. When put to the test, however, it invariably produced a plastic cup filled with a liquid that was almost, but nit quite, entirely unlike tea. 
He attempted to reason with the thing. 
"Tea," he said. 
"Share and Enjoy," the machine replied and provided him with yet another cup of the sickly liquid. 
He threw it away. 
"Share and enjoy," the machine repeated and provided him with another one. 
"Share and Enjoy" is the company motto of the hugely successful Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Complaints division, which now covers the major land masses of three medium sized planets and is the only part of the Corporation to have shown a consistent profit in recent years. 
The motto stands or rather stood in three mile high illuminated letters near the Complaints Department spaceport on Eadrax. Unfortunately its weight was such that shortly after it was erected, the ground beneath the letters caved in and they dropped for nearly half their length through the offices of many talented young complaints executives now deceased. 
The protruding upper halves of the letters now appear, in the local language, to read "Go stick your head in a pig", and are no longer illuminated, except at times of special celebration. 
Arthur threw away a sixth cup of the liquid. 
"Listen, you machine," he said, "you claim you can synthesize any drink in existence, so why do you keep giving me the same undrinkable stuff?" 
"Nutrition and pleasurable sense data," burbled the machine. "Share and Enjoy." 
"It tastes filthy!" 
"If you have enjoyed the experience of this drink," continued the machine, "why not share it with your friends?" 
"Because," said Arthur tartly, "I want to keep them. Will you try to comprehend what I'm telling you? That drink..." 
"That drink," said the machine sweetly, "was individually tailored to meet your personal requirements for nutrition and pleasure." 
"Ah," said Arthur, "so I'm a masochist on diet am I?" "Share and Enjoy."â¨"Oh shut up."â¨"Will that be all?" 
Arthur decided to give up. 
"Yes," he said. 
Then he decided he'd be dammed if he'd give up. 
"No," he said, "look, it's very, very simple... all I want... is a cup of tea. You are going to make one for me. Keep quiet and listen." 
And he sat. He told the Nutri-Matic about India, he told it about China, he told it about Ceylon. He told it about broad leaves drying in the sun. He told it about silver teapots. He told it about summer afternoons on the lawn. He told it about putting in the milk before the tea so it wouldn't get scalded. He even told it (briefly) about the history of the East India Company. 
"So that's it, is it?" said the Nutri-Matic when he had finished. "Yes," said Arthur, "that is what I want."â¨"You want the taste of dried leaves boiled in water?"â¨"Er, yes. With milk." 
"Squirted out of a cow?"â¨"Well, in a manner of speaking I suppose..." 
"I'm going to need some help with this one," said the machine tersely. All the cheerful burbling had dropped out of its voice and it now meant business. 
"Well, anything I can do," said Arthur.â¨"You've done quite enough," the Nutri-Matic informed him. It summoned up the ship's computer.â¨"Hi there!" said the ship's computer. 
The Nutri-Matic explained about tea to the ship's computer. The computer boggled, linked logic circuits with the Nutri-Matic and together they lapsed into a grim silence. 
Arthur watched and waited for a while, but nothing further happened. 
He thumped it, but still nothing happened.â¨Eventually he gave up and wandered up to the bridge. 
In the empty wastes of space, the Heart of Gold hung still. Around it blazed the billion pinpricks of the Galaxy. Towards it crept the ugly yellow lump of the Vogon ship. 
Chapter 3 
"Does anyone have a kettle?" Arthur asked as he walked on to the bridge, and instantly began to wonder why Trillian was yelling at the computer to talk to her, Ford was thumping it and Zaphod was kicking it, and also why there was a nasty yellow lump on the vision screen. 
He put down the empty cup he was carrying and walked over to them. 
"Hello?" he said. 
At that moment Zaphod flung himself over to the polished marble surfaces that contained the instruments that controlled the conventional photon drive. They materialized beneath his hands and he flipped over to manual control. He pushed, he pulled, he pressed and he swore. The photon drive gave a sickly judder and cut out again. 
"Something up?" said Arthur. 
"Hey, didja hear that?" muttered Zaphod as he leapt now for the manual controls of the Infinite Improbability Drive, "the monkey spoke!" 
The Improbability Drive gave two small whines and then also cut out. 
"Pure history, man," said Zaphod, kicking the Improbability Drive, "a talking monkey!" 
"If you're upset about something..." said Arthur. "Vogons!" snapped Ford, "we're under attack!" Arthur gibbered.â¨"Well what are you doing? Let's get out of here!" "Can't. Computer's jammed." 
"Jammed?" 
"It says all its circuits are occupied. There's no power anywhere in the ship." 
Ford moved away from the computer terminal, wiped a sleeve across his forehead and slumped back against the wall. 
"Nothing we can do," he said. He glared at nothing and bit his lip. 
When Arthur had been a boy at school, long before the Earth had been demolished, he had used to play football. He had not been at all good at it, and his particular speciality had been scoring own goals in important matches. Whenever this happened he used to experience a peculiar tingling round the back of his neck that would slowly creep up across his cheeks and heat his brow. The image of mud and grass and lots of little jeering boys flinging it at him suddenly came vividly to his mind at this moment. 
A peculiar tingling sensation at the back of his neck was creeping up across his cheeks and heating his brow. 
He started to speak, and stopped.â¨He started to speak again and stopped again. Finally he managed to speak.â¨"Er," he said. He cleared his throat. 
"Tell me," he continued, and said it so nervously that the others all turned to stare at him. He glanced at the approaching yellow blob on the vision screen. 
"Tell me," he said again, "did the computer say what was occupying it? I just ask out of interest..." 
Their eyes were riveted on him. 
"And, er... well that's it really, just asking." 
Zaphod put out a hand and held Arthur by the scruff of the neck. 
"What have you done to it, Monkeyman?" he breathed. 
"Well," said Arthur, "nothing in fact. It's just that I think a short while ago it was trying to work out how to..." 
"Yes?" 
"Make me some tea." 
"That's right guys," the computer sang out suddenly, "just coping with that problem right now, and wow, it's a biggy. Be with you in a while." It lapsed back into a silence that was only matched for sheer intensity by the silence of the three people staring at Arthur Dent. 
As if to relieve the tension, the Vogons chose that moment to start firing. 
The ship shook, the ship thundered. Outside, the inch thick force- shield around it blistered, crackled and spat under the barrage of a dozen 30-Megahurt Definit-Kil Photrazon Cannon, and looked as if it wouldn't be around for long. Four minutes is how long Ford Prefect gave it."Three minutes and fifty seconds," he said a short while later. 
"Forty-five seconds," he added at the appropriate time. He flicked idly at some useless switches, then gave Arthur an unfriendly look. 
"Dying for a cup of tea, eh?" he said. "Three minutes and forty seconds." 
"Will you stop counting!" snarled Zaphod.â¨"Yes," said Ford Prefect, "in three minutes and thirty-five seconds." 
Aboard the Vogon ship, Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was puzzled. He had expected a chase, he had expected an exciting grapple with tractor beams, he had expected to have to use the specially installed Sub- Cyclic Normality Assert-i-Tron to counter the Heart of Gold's Infinite Improbability Drive, but the Sub-Cyclic Normality Assert-i-Tron lay idle as the Heart of Gold just sat there and took it. 
A dozen 30-Megahurt Definit-Kil Photrazon Cannon continued to blaze away at the Heart of Gold, and still it just sat there and took it. 
He tested every sensor at his disposal to see if there was any subtle trickery afoot, but no subtle trickery was to be found. 
He didn't know about the tea of course. 
Nor did he know exactly how the occupants of the Heart of Gold were spending the last three minutes and thirty seconds of life they had left to spend. 
Quite how Zaphod Beeblebrox arrived at the idea of holding a seance at this point is something he was never quite clear on. 
Obviously the subject of death was in the air, but more as something to be avoided than harped upon. 
Possibly the horror that Zaphod experienced at the prospect of being reunited with his deceased relatives led on to the thought that they might just feel the same way about him and, what's more, be able to do something about helping to postpone this reunion. 
Or again it might just have been one of the strange promptings that occasionally surfaced from that dark area of his mind that he had inexplicably locked off prior to becoming President of the Galaxy. 
"You want to talk to your great grandfather?" boggled Ford. "Yeah."â¨"Does it have to be now?" 
The ship continued to shake and thunder. The temperature was rising. The light was getting dimmer all the energy the computer didn't require for thinking about tea was being pumped into the rapidly fading force-field. 
"Yeah!" insisted Zaphod. "Listen Ford, I think he may be able to help us." 
"Are you sure you mean think? Pick your words with care." 
"Suggest something else we can do." 
"Er, well..." 
"OK, round the central console. Now. Come on! Trillian, Monkeyman, move." 
They clustered round the central console in confusion, sat down and, feeling exceptionally foolish, held hands. With his third hand Zaphod turned off the lights. 
Darkness gripped the ship. 
Outside, the thunderous roar of the Definit-Kil cannon continued to rip at the force-field. 
"Concentrate," hissed Zaphod, "on his name." "What is it?" asked Arthur.â¨"Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth."â¨"What?" 
"Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth. Concentrate!" 
"The Fourth?" 
"Yeah. Listen, I'm Zaphod Beeblebrox, my father was Zaphod Beeblebrox the Second, my grandfather Zaphod Beeblebrox the Third..." 
"What?" 
"There was an accident with a contraceptive and a time machine. Now concentrate!" 
"Three minutes," said Ford Prefect.â¨"Why," said Arthur Dent, "are we doing this?"â¨"Shut up," suggested Zaphod Beeblebrox.â¨Trillian said nothing. What, she thought, was there to say? 
The only light on the bridge came from two dim red triangles in a far corner where Marvin the Paranoid Android sat slumped, ignoring all and ignored by all, in a private and rather unpleasant world of his own. 
Round the central console four figures hunched in tight concentration trying to blot from their minds the terrifying shuddering of the ship and the fearful roar that echoed through it. 
They concentrated. 
Still they concentrated. 
And still they concentrated. 
The seconds ticked by. 
On Zaphod's brow stood beads of sweat, first of concentration, then of frustration and finally of embarrassment. 
At last he let out a cry of anger, snatched back his hands from Trillian and Ford and stabbed at the light switch. 
"Ah, I was beginning to think you'd never turn the lights on," said a voice. "No, not too bright please, my eyes aren't what they once were." 
Four figures jolted upright in their seats. Slowly they turned their heads to look, though their scalps showed a distinct propensity to try and stay in the same place. 
"Now. Who disturbs me at this time?" said the small, bent, gaunt figure standing by the sprays of fern at the far end of the bridge. His two small wispy-haired heads looked so ancient that it seemed they might hold dim memories of the birth of the galaxies themselves. One lolled in sleep, but the other squinted sharply at them. If his eyes weren't what they once were, they must once have been diamond cutters. 
Zaphod stuttered nervously for a moment. He gave the intricate little double nod which is the traditional Betelgeusian gesture of familial respect. 
"Oh... er, hi Great Granddad..." he breathed. 
The little old figure moved closer towards them. He peered through the dim light. He thrust out a bony finger at his great grandson. 
"Ah," he snapped. "Zaphod Beeblebrox. The last of our great line. Zaphod Beeblebrox the Nothingth." 
"The First." 
"The Nothingth," spat the figure. Zaphod hated his voice. It always seemed to him to screech like fingernails across the blackboard of what he liked to think of as his soul. 
He shifted awkwardly in his seat. 
"Er, yeah," he muttered, "Er, look, I'm really sorry about the flowers, I meant to send them along, but you know, the shop was fresh out of wreaths and..." 
"You forget!" snapped Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth. 
"Well..." 
"Too busy. Never think of other people. The living are all the same." 
"Two minutes, Zaphod," whispered Ford in an awed whisper. 
Zaphod fidgeted nervously. 
"Yeah, but I did mean to send them," he said. "And I'll write to my great grandmother as well, just as soon as we get out of this..." 
"Your great grandmother," mused the gaunt little figure to himself. 
"Yeah," said Zaphod, "Er, how is she? Tell you what, I'll go and see her. But first we've just got to..." 
"Your late great grandmother and I are very well," rasped Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth. 
"Ah. Oh." 
"But very disappointed in you, young Zaphod..." 
"Yeah well..." Zaphod felt strangely powerless to take charge of this conversation, and Ford's heavy breathing at his side told him that the seconds were ticking away fast. The noise and the shaking had reached terrifying proportions. He saw Trillian and Arthur's faces white and unblinking in the gloom. 
"Er, Great Grandfather..." 
"We've been following your progress with considerable despondency..." 
"Yeah, look, just at the moment you see..."â¨"Not to say contempt!"â¨"Could you sort of listen for a moment..."â¨"I mean what exactly are you doing with your life?" 
"I'm being attacked by a Vogon fleet!" cried Zaphod. It was an exaggeration, but it was his only opportunity so far of getting the basic point of the exercise across. 
"Doesn't surprise me in the least," said the little old figure with a shrug. 
"Only it's happening right now you see," insisted Zaphod feverishly. 
The spectral ancestor nodded, picked up the cup Arthur Dent had brought in and looked at it with interest. 
"Er... Great Granddad..." 
"Did you know," interrupting the ghostly figure, fixing Zaphod with a stern look, "that Betelgeuse Five has developed a very slight eccentricy in its orbit?" 
Zaphod didn't and found the information hard to concentrate on what with all the noise and the imminence of death and so on. 
"Er, no... look," he said. 
"Me spinning in my grave!" barked the ancestor. He slammed the cup down and pointed a quivering, stick-like see-through finger at Zaphod. 
"Your fault!" he screeched. 
"One minute thirty," muttered Ford, his head in his hands. 
"Yeah, look Great Granddad, can you actually help because..." 
"Help?" exclaimed the old man as if he'd been asked for a stoat. 
"Yeah, help, and like, now, because otherwise..." 
"Help!" repeated the old man as if he'd been asked for a lightly grilled stoat in a bun with French fries. He stood amazed. 
"You go swanning your way round the Galaxy with your..." the ancestor waved a contemptuous hand, "with your disreputable friends, too busy to put flowers on my grave, plastic ones would have done, would have been quite appropriate from you, but no. Too busy. Too modern. Too sceptical till you suddenly find yourself in a bit of a fix and come over suddenly all astrally-minded!" 
He shook his head carefully, so as not to disturb the slumber of the other one, which was already becoming restive. 
"Well, I don't know, young Zaphod," he continued, "I think I'll have to think about this one." 
"One minute ten," said Ford hollowly. 
Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth peered at him curiously. 
"Why does that man keep talking in numbers?" he said. 
"Those numbers," said Zaphod tersely, "are the time we've got left to live." 
"Oh," said his great grandfather. He grunted to himself. "Doesn't apply to me, of course," he said and moved off to a dimmer recess of the bridge in search of something else to poke around at. 
Zaphod felt he was teetering on the edge of madness and wondered if he shouldn't just jump over and have done with it. 
"Great Grandfather," he said, "It applies to us! We are still alive, and we are about to lose our lives." 
"Good job too." 
"What?" 
"What use is your life to anyone? When I think of what you've made of it the phrase 'pig's ear' comes irresistibly to my mind." 
"But I was President of the Galaxy, man!" 
"Huh," muttered his ancestor, "And what kind of a job is that for a Beeblebrox?" 
"Hey, what? Only President you know! Of the whole Galaxy!" "Conceited little megapuppy."â¨Zaphod blinked in bewilderment.â¨"Hey, er, what are you at, man? I mean Great Grandfather." 
The hunched up little figure stalked up to his great grandson and tapped him sternly on the knee. This had the effect of reminding Zaphod that he was talking to a ghost because he didn't feel a thing. 
"You know and I know what being President means, young Zaphod. You know because you've been it, and I know because I'm dead and it gives one such a wonderfully uncluttered perspective. We have a saying up here. 'Life is wasted on the living.'" 
"Yeah," said Zaphod bitterly, "very good. Very deep. Right now I need aphorisms like I need holes in my heads." 
"Fifty seconds," grunted Ford Prefect. 
"Where was I?" said Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth. 
"Pontificating," said Zaphod Beeblebrox. 
"Oh yes." 
"Can this guy," muttered Ford quietly to Zaphod, "actually in fact help us?" 
"Nobody else can," whispered Zaphod. 
Ford nodded despondently. 
"Zaphod!" the ghost was saying, "you became President of the Galaxy for a reason. Have you forgotten?" 
"Could we go into this later?" 
"Have you forgotten!" insisted the ghost. 
"Yeah! Of course I forgot! I had to forget. They screen your brain when you get the job you know. If they'd found my head full of tricksy ideas I'd have been right out on the streets again with nothing but a fat pension, secretarial staff, a fleet of ships and a couple of slit throats." 
"Ah," nodded the ghost in satisfaction, "then you do remember!" 
He paused for a moment. 
"Good," he said and the noise stopped. 
"Forty-eight seconds," said Ford. He looked again at his watch and tapped it. He looked up. 
"Hey, the noise has stopped," he said. 
A mischievous twinkle gleamed in the ghost's hard little eyes. 
"I've slowed down time for a moment," he said, "just for a moment you understand. I would hate you to miss all I have to say." 
"No, you listen to me, you see-through old bat," said Zaphod leaping out of his chair, "A thanks for stopping time and all that, great, terrific, wonderful, but B no thanks for the homily, right? I don't know what this great think I'm meant to be doing is, and it looks to me as if I was supposed not to know. And I resent that, right? 
"The old me knew. The old me cared. Fine, so far so hoopy. Except that the old me cared so much that he actually got inside his own brain my own brain and locked off the bits that knew and cared, because if I knew and cared I wouldn't be able to do it. I wouldn't be 
able to go and be President, and I wouldn't be able to steal this ship, which must be the important thing. 
"But this former self of mine killed himself off, didn't he, by changing my brain? OK, that was his choice. This new me has its own choices to make, and by a strange coincidence those choices involve not knowing and not caring about this big number, whatever it is. That's what he wanted, that's what he got. 
"Except this old self of mine tried to leave himself in control, leaving orders for me in the bit of my brain he locked off. Well, I don't want to know, and I don't want to hear them. That's my choice. I'm not going to be anybody's puppet, particularly not my own." 
Zaphod banged the console in fury, oblivious to the dumbfolded looks he was attracting. 
"The old me is dead!" he raved, "Killed himself! The dead shouldn't hang about trying to interfere with the living!" 
"And yet you summon me up to help you out of a scrape," said the ghost. 
"Ah," said Zaphod, sitting down again, "well that's different isn't it?" 
He grinned at Trillian, weakly. 
"Zaphod," rasped the apparition, "I think the only reason I waste my breath on you is that being dead I don't have any other use for it." 
"OK," said Zaphod, "why don't you tell me what the big secret is. Try me." 
"Zaphod, you knew when you were President of the Galaxy, as did Yooden Vranx before you, that the President is nothing. A cipher. Somewhere in the shadows behind is another man, being, something, with ultimate power. That man, or being, or something, you must find the man who controls this Galaxy, and we suspect others. Possibly the entire Universe." 
"Why?" 
"Why?" exclaimed an astonished ghost, "Why? Look around you lad, does it look to you as if it's in very good hands?" 
"It's alright."â¨The old ghost glowered at him. 
"I will not argue with you. You will simply take this ship, this Improbability Drive ship to where it is needed. You will do it. Don't think you can escape your purpose. The Improbability Field controls you, you are in its grip. What's this?" 
He was standing tapping at one of the terminals of Eddie the Shipboard Computer. Zaphod told him. 
"What's it doing?" 
"It is trying," said Zaphod with wonderful restraint, "to make tea." 
"Good," said his great grandfather, "I approve of that. Now Zaphod, "he said, turning and wagging a finger at him, "I don't know if you are really capable of succeeding in your job. I think you will not be able to avoid it. However, I am too long dead and too tired to care as much as I did. The principal reason I am helping you now is that I couldn't bear the thought of you and your modern friends slouching about up here. Understood?" 
"Yeah, thanks a bundle." 
"Oh, and Zaphod?" 
"Er, yeah?" 
"If you ever find you need help again, you know, if you're in trouble, need a hand out of a tight corner..." 
"Yeah?" 
"Please don't hesitate to get lost." 
Within the space of one second, a bolt of light flashed from the wizened old ghost's hands to the computer, the ghost vanished, the bridge filled with billowing smoke and the Heart of Gold leapt an unknown distance through the dimensions of time and space. 
Chapter 4 
Ten light years away, Gag Halfrunt jacked up his smile by several notches. As he watched the picture on his vision screen, relayed across the sub-ether from the bridge of the Vogon ship, he saw the final shreds of the Heart of Gold's force-shield ripped away, and the ship itself vanish in a puff of smoke. 
Good, he thought. 
The end of the last stray survivors of the demolition he had ordered on the planet Earth, he thought. 
The final end of this dangerous (to the psychiatric profession) and subversive (also to the psychiatric profession) experiment to find the Question to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything, he thought. 
There would be some celebration with his fellows tonight, and in the morning they would meet again their unhappy, bewildered and highly profitable patients, secure in the knowledge that the Meaning of Life would not now be, once and for all, well and truly sorted out, he thought. 
"Family's always embarrassing isn't it?" said Ford to Zaphod as the smoke began to clear. 
He paused, then looked about. 
"Where's Zaphod?" he said. 
Arthur and Trillian looked about blankly. They were pale and shaken and didn't know where Zaphod was. 
"Marvin?" said Ford, "Where's Zaphod?" A moment later he said:â¨"Where's Marvin?"â¨The robot's corner was empty. 
The ship was utterly silent. It lay in thick black space. Occasionally it rocked and swayed. Every instrument was dead, every vision screen was dead. They consulted the computer. It said: 
"I regret that I have been temporarily closed to all communication. Meanwhile, here is some light music." 
They turned off the light music. 
They searched every corner of the ship in increasing bewilderment and alarm. Everywhere was dead and silent. Nowhere was there any trace of Zaphod or of Marvin. 
One of the last areas they checked was the small bay in which the Nutri-Matic machine was located. 
On the delivery plate of the Nutri-Matic Drink Synthesizer was a small tray, on which sat three bone china cups and saucers, a bone china jug of milk, a silver teapot full of the best tea Arthur had ever tasted, and a small printed note saying "Wait". 
Chapter 5 
Ursa Minor Beta is, some say, one of the most appalling places in the known Universe. 
Although it is excruciatingly rich, horrifyingly sunny and more full of wonderfully exciting people than a pomegranate is of pips, it can hardly be insignificant that when a recent edition of Playbeing magazine headlined an article with the words "When you are tired of Ursa Minor Beta you are tired of life", the suicide rate quadrupled overnight. 
Not that there are any nights on Ursa Minor Beta. 
It is a West Zone planet which by an inexplicable and somewhat suspicious freak of topography consists almost entirely of sub-tropical coastline. By an equally suspicious freak of temporal relastatics, it is nearly always Saturday afternoon just before the beach bars close. 
No adequate explanation for this has been forthcoming from the dominant lifeforms on Ursa Minor Beta, who spend most of their time attempting to achieve spiritual enlightenment by running round swimming pools, and inviting Investigation Officials form the Galactic Geo-Temporal Control Board to "have a nice diurnal anomaly". 
There is only one city on Ursa Minor Beta, and that is only called a city because the swimming pools are slightly thicker on the ground there than elsewhere. 
If you approach Light City by air and there is no other way of approaching it, no roads, no port facilities if you don't fly they don't want to see you in Light City you will see why it has this name. Here the sun shines brightest of all, glittering on the swimming pools, shimmering on the white, palm-lined boulevards, glistening on the healthy bronzed specks moving up and down them, gleaming off the villas, the hazy airpads, the beach bars and so on. 
Most particularly it shines on a building, a tall beautiful building consisting of two thirty-storey white towers connected by a bridge half-way up their length. 
The building is the home of a book, and was built here on the proceeds of an extraordinary copyright law suit fought between the book's editors and a breakfast cereal company. 
The book is a guide book, a travel book. 
It is one of the most remarkable, certainly the most successful, books ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of Ursa Minor more popular than Life Begins at Five Hundred and Fifty, better selling than The Big Bang Theory A Personal View by Eccentrica Gallumbits (the triple breasted whore of Eroticon Six) and more controversial than Oolon Colluphid's latest blockbusting title Everything You Never Wanted To Know About Sex But Have Been Forced To Find Out. 
(And in many of the more relaxed civilizations on the Outer Eastern Rim of the Galaxy, it has long surplanted the great Encyclopaedia Galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom, for though it has many omissions and contains much that is apocryphal, or at least wildly inaccurate, it scores over the older and more pedestrian work in two important respects. First, it is slightly cheaper, and secondly it has the words DON'T PANIC printed in large friendly letters on its cover.) 
It is of course that invaluable companion for all those who want to see the marvels of the known Universe for less than thirty Altairan Dollars a day The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. 
If you stood with your back to the main entrance lobby of the Guide offices (assuming you had landed by now and freshened up with a quick dip and shower) and then walked east, you would pass along the leafy shade of Life Boulevard, be amazed by the pale golden colour of the beaches stretching away to your left, astounded by the mind-surfers floating carelessly along two feet above the waves as if it was nothing special, surprised and eventually slightly irritated by the giant palm trees that hum toneless nothings throughout the daylight hours, in other words continuously. 
If you then walked to the end of Life Boulevard you would enter the Lalamatine district of shops, bolonut trees and pavement cafes where the UM-Betans come to relax after a hard afternoon's relaxation on the beach. The Lalamatine district is one of those very few areas which doesn't enjoy a perpetual Saturday afternoon it 
enjoys instead the cool of a perpetual early Saturday evening. Behind it lie the night clubs. 
If, on this particular day, afternoon, stretch of eveningtime call it what you will you had approached the second pavement cafe on the right you would have seen the usual crowd of UM-Betans chatting, drinking, looking very relaxed, and casually glancing at each other's watches to see how expensive they were. 
You would also have seen a couple of rather dishevelled looking hitch-hikers from Algol who had recently arrived on an Arcturan Megafreighter aboard which they had been roughing it for a few days. They were angry and bewildered to discover that here, within sight of the Hitchhiker's Guide building itself, a simple glass of fruit juice cost the equivalent of over sixty Altairan dollars. 
"Sell out," one of them said, bitterly. 
If at that moment you had then looked at the next table but one you would have seen Zaphod Beeblebrox sitting and looking very startled and confused. 
The reason for his confusion was that five seconds earlier he had been sitting on the bridge of the starship Heart of Gold. 
"Absolute sell out," said the voice again. 
Zaphod looked nervously out of the corners of his eyes at the two dishevelled hitch-hikers at the next table. Where the hell was he? How had he got there? Where was his ship? His hand felt the arm of the chair on which he was sitting, and then the table in front of him. They seemed solid enough. He sat very still. 
"How can they sit and write a guide for hitch-hikers in a place like this?" continued the voice. "I mean look at it. Look at it!" 
Zaphod was looking at it. Nice place, he thought. But where? And why? 
He fished in his pocket for his two pairs of sunglasses. In the same pocket he felt a hard smooth, unidentified lump of very heavy metal. He pulled it out and looked at it. He blinked at it in surprise. Where had he got that? He returned it to his pocket and put on the sunglasses, annoyed to discover that the metal object had scratched one of the lenses. Nevertheless, he felt much more comfortable with them on. They were a double pair of Joo Janta 200 Super-Chromatic Peril Sensitive Sunglasses, which had been specially designed to help 
people develop a relaxed attitude to danger. At the first hint of trouble they turn totally black and thus prevent you from seeing anything that might alarm you. 
Apart from the scratch the lenses were clear. He relaxed, but only a little bit. 
The angry hitch-hiker continued to glare at his monstrously expensive fruit juice. 
"Worst thing that ever happened to the Guide, moving to Ursa Minor Beta," he grumbled, "they've all gone soft. You know, I've even heard that they've created a whole electronically synthesized Universe in one of their offices so they can go and research stories during the day and still go to parties in the evening. Not that day and evening mean much in this place." 
Ursa Minor Beta, thought Zaphod. At least he knew where he was now. He assumed that this must be his great grandfather's doing, but why? 
Much to his annoyance, a thought popped into his mind. It was very clear and very distinct, and he had now come to recognize these thoughts for what they were. His instinct was to resist them. They were the pre-ordained promptings from the dark and locked off parts of his mind. 
He sat still and ignored the thought furiously. It nagged at him. He ignored it. It nagged at him. He ignored it. It nagged at him. He gave in to it. 
What the hell, he thought, go with the flow. He was too tired, confused and hungry to resist. He didn't even know what the thought meant. 
Chapter 6 
"Hello? Yes? Megadodo Publications, home of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the most totally remarkable book in the whole of the known Universe, can I help you?" said the large pink-winged insect into one of the seventy phones lined up along the vast chrome expanse of the reception desk in the foyer of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy offices. It fluttered its wings and rolled its eyes. It glared at all the grubby people cluttering up the foyer, soiling the carpets and leaving dirty handmarks on the upholstery. It adored working for the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, it just wished there was some way of keeping all the hitch-hikers away. Weren't they meant to be hanging round dirty spaceports or something? It was certain that it had read something somewhere in the book about the importance of hanging round dirty spaceports. Unfortunately most of them seemed to come and hang around in this nice clean shiny foyer after hanging around in extremely dirty spaceports. And all they ever did was complain. It shivered its wings. 
"What?" it said into the phone. "Yes, I passed on your message to Mr. Zarniwoop, but I'm afraid he's too cool to see you right now. He's on an intergalactic cruise." 
It waved a petulant tentacle at one of the grubby people who was angrily trying to engage its attention. The petulant tentacle directed the angry person to look at the notice on the wall to its left and not to interrupt an important phone call. 
"Yes," said the insect, "he is in his office, but he's on an intergalactic cruise. Thank you so much for calling." It slammed down the phone. 
"Read the notice," it said to the angry man who was trying to complain about one of the more ludicrous and dangerous pieces of misinformation contained in the book. 
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is an indispensable companion to all those who are keen to make sense of life in an infinitely complex 
and confusing Universe, for though it cannot hope to be useful or informative on all matters, it does at least make the reassuring claim, that where it is inaccurate it is at least definitely inaccurate. In cases of major discrepancy it's always reality that's got it wrong. 
This was the gist of the notice. It said "The Guide is definitive. Reality is frequently inaccurate." 
This has led to some interesting consequences. For instance, when the Editors of the Guide were sued by the families of those who had died as a result of taking the entry on the planet Traal literally (it said "Ravenous Bugblatter beasts often make a very good meal for visiting tourists" instead of "Ravenous Bugblatter beasts often make a very good meal of visiting tourists") they claimed that the first version of the sentence was the more aesthetically pleasing, summoned a qualified poet to testify under oath that beauty was truth, truth beauty and hoped thereby to prove that the guilty party was Life itself for failing to be either beautiful or true. The judges concurred, and in a moving speech held that Life itself was in contempt of court, and duly confiscated it from all those there present before going off to enjoy a pleasant evening's ultragolf. 
Zaphod Beeblebrox entered the foyer. He strode up to the insect receptionist. 
"OK," he said, "Where's Zarniwoop? Get me Zarniwoop." 
"Excuse me, sir?" said the insect icily. It did not care to be addressed in this manner. 
"Zarniwoop. Get him, right? Get him now." 
"Well, sir," snapped the fragile little creature, "if you could be a little cool about it..." 
Look," said Zaphod, "I'm up to here with cool, OK? I'm so amazingly cool you could keep a side of meat inside me for a month. I am so hip I have difficulty seeing over my pelvis. Now will you move before you blow it?" 
"Well, if you'd let me explain, sir," said the insect tapping the most petulant of all the tentacles at its disposal, "I'm afraid that isn't possible right now as Mr. Zarniwoop is on an intergalactic cruise." 
Hell, thought Zaphod.â¨"When he's going to be back?" he said. "Back sir? He's in his office." 
Zaphod paused while he tried to sort this particular thought out in his mind. He didn't succeed. 
"This cat's on an intergalactic cruise... in his office?" He leaned forward and gripped the tapping tentacle. 
"Listen, three eyes," he said, "don't you try to outweird me. I get stranger things than you free with my breakfast cereal." 
"Well, just who do you think you are, honey?" flounced the insect quivering its wings in rage, "Zaphod Beeblebrox or something?" 
"Count the heads," said Zaphod in a low rasp. 
The insect blinked at him. It blinked at him again. 
"You are Zaphod Beeblebrox?" it squeaked. 
"Yeah," said Zaphod, "but don't shout it out or they'll all want one." 
"The Zaphod Beeblebrox?" 
"No, just a Zaphod Beeblebrox, didn't you hear I come in six packs?" 
The insect rattled its tentacles together in agitation. 
"But sir," it squealed, "I just heard on the sub-ether radio report. It said that you were dead..." 
"Yeah, that's right," said Zaphod, "I just haven't stopped moving yet. Now. Where do I find Zarniwoop?" 
"Well, sir, his office is on the fifteenth floor, but..." 
"But he's on an intergalactic cruise, yeah, yeah, how do I get to him." 
"The newly installed Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Vertical People Transporters are in the far corner sir. But sir..." 
Zaphod was turning to go. He turned back. 
"Yeah?" he said. 
"Can I ask you why you want to see Mr. Zarniwoop?" 
"Yeah," said Zaphod, who was unclear on this point himself, "I told myself I had to." 
"Come again sir?" 
Zaphod leaned forward, conspirationally. 
"I just materialized out of thin air in one of your cafes," he said, "as a result of an argument with the ghost of my great grandfather. No sooner had I got there that my former self, the one that operated on 
my brain, popped into my head and said 'Go see Zarniwoop'. I have never heard of the cat. That is all I know. That and the fact that I've got to find the man who rules the Universe." 
He winked. 
"Mr. Beeblebrox, sir," said the insect in awed wonder, "you're so weird you should be in movies." 
"Yeah," said Zaphod patting the thing on a glittering pink wing, "and you, baby, should be in real life." 
The insect paused for a moment to recover from its agitation and then reached out a tentacle to answer a ringing phone. 
A metal hand restrained it. 
"Excuse me," said the owner of the metal hand in a voice that would have made an insect of a more sentimental disposition collapse in tears. 
This was not such an insect, and it couldn't stand robots. 
"Yes, sir," it snapped, "can I help you?" 
"I doubt it," said Marvin. 
"Well in that case, if you'll just excuse me..." Six of the phones were now ringing. A million things awaited the insect's attention. 
"No one can help me," intoned Marvin. 
"Yes, sir, well..." 
"Not that anyone tried of course." The restraining metal hand fell limply by Marvin's side. His head hung forward very slightly. 
"Is that so," said the insect tartly. 
"Hardly worth anyone's while to help a menial robot is it?" 
"I'm sorry, sir, if..." 
"I mean where's the percentage in being kind or helpful to a robot if it doesn't have any gratitude circuits?" 
"And you don't have any?" said the insect, who didn't seem to be able to drag itself out of this conversation. 
"I've never had occasion to find out," Marvin informed it. "Listen, you miserable heap of maladjusted metal..." "Aren't you going to ask me what I want?" 
The insect paused. Its long thin tongue darted out and licked its eyes and darted back again. 
"Is it worth it?" it asked.â¨"Is anything?" said Marvin immediately.â¨"What... do... you... want?"â¨"I'm looking for someone."â¨"Who?" hissed the insect.â¨"Zaphod Beeblebrox," said Marvin, "he's over there." The insect shook with rage. It could hardly speak. "Then why did you ask me?" it screamed.â¨"I just wanted something to talk to," said Marvin. "What!"â¨"Pathetic isn't it?" 
With a grinding of gears Marvin turned and trundled off. He caught up with Zaphod approaching the elevators. Zaphod span round in astonishment. 
"Hey... Marvin!" he said, "Marvin! How did you get here?"â¨Marvin was forced to say something which came very hard to him. "I don't know," he said.â¨"But..." 
"One moment I was sitting in your ship feeling very depressed, and the next moment I was standing here feeling utterly miserable. An Improbability Field I expect." 
"Yeah," said Zaphod, "I expect my great grandfather sent you along to keep me company." 
"Thanks a bundle grandad," he added to himself under his breath. 
"So, how are you?" he said aloud. 
"Oh, fine," said Marvin, "if you happen to like being me which personally I don't." 
"Yeah, yeah," said Zaphod as the elevator doors opened. 
"Hello," said the elevator sweetly, "I am to be your elevator for this trip to the floor of your choice. I have been designed by the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation to take you, the visitor to the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, into these their offices. If you enjoy your ride, which will be swift and pleasurable, then you may care to experience some of the other elevators which have recently been installed in the offices of the Galactic tax department, Boobiloo Baby Foods and the 
Sirian State Mental Hospital, where many ex-Sirius Cybernetics Corporation executives will be delighted to welcome your visits, sympathy, and happy tales of the outside world." 
"Yeah," said Zaphod, stepping into it, "what else do you do besides talk?" 
"I go up," said the elevator, "or down." "Good," said Zaphod, "We're going up." "Or down," the elevator reminded him. "Yeah, OK, up please." 
There was a moment of silence.â¨"Down's very nice," suggested the elevator hopefully. "Oh yeah?"â¨"Super."â¨"Good," said Zaphod, "Now will you take us up?" 
"May I ask you," inquired the elevator in its sweetest, most reasonable voice, "if you've considered all the possibilities that down might offer you?" 
Zaphod knocked one of his heads against the inside wall. He didn't need this, he thought to himself, this of all things he had no need of. He hadn't asked to be here. If he was asked at this moment where he would like to be he would probably have said he would like to be lying on the beach with at least fifty beautiful women and a small team of experts working out new ways they could be nice to him, which was his usual reply. To this he would probably have added something passionate on the subject of food. 
One thing he didn't want to be doing was chasing after the man who ruled the Universe, who was only doing a job which he might as well keep at, because if it wasn't him it would only be someone else. Most of all he didn't want to be standing in an office block arguing with an elevator. 
"Like what other possibilities?" he asked wearily. 
"Well," the voice trickled on like honey on biscuits, "there's the basement, the microfiles, the heating system... er..." 
It paused. 
"Nothing particularly exciting," it admitted, "but they are alternatives." 
"Holy Zarquon," muttered Zaphod, "did I ask for an existentialist elevator?" he beat his fists against the wall. 
"What's the matter with the thing?" he spat. 
"It doesn't want to go up," said Marvin simply, "I think it's afraid." 
"Afraid?" cried Zaphod, "Of what? Heights? An elevator that's afraid of heights?" 
"No," said the elevator miserably, "of the future..." 
"The future?" exclaimed Zaphod, "What does the wretched thing want, a pension scheme?" 
At that moment a commotion broke out in the reception hall behind them. From the walls around them came the sound of suddenly active machinery. 
"We can all see into the future," whispered the elevator in what sounded like terror, "it's part of our programming." 
Zaphod looked out of the elevator an agitated crowd had gathered round the elevator area, pointing and shouting. 
Every elevator in the building was coming down, very fast. 
He ducked back in. 
"Marvin," he said, "just get this elevator go up will you? We've got to get to Zarniwoop." 
"Why?" asked Marvin dolefully. 
"I don't know," said Zaphod, "but when I find him, he'd better have a very good reason for me wanting to see him." 
Modern elevators are strange and complex entities. The ancient electric winch and "maximum-capacity-eight-persons" jobs bear as much relation to a Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Happy Vertical People Transporter as a packet of mixed nuts does to the entire west wing of the Sirian State Mental Hospital. 
This is because they operate on the curios principle of "defocused temporal perception". In other words they have the capacity to see dimly into the immediate future, which enables the elevator to be on the right floor to pick you up even before you knew you wanted it, thus eliminating all the tedious chatting, relaxing, and making friends that people were previously forced to do whist waiting for elevators. 
Not unnaturally, many elevators imbued with intelligence and precognition became terribly frustrated with the mindless business of going up and down, up and down, experimented briefly with the notion of going sideways, as a sort of existential protest, demanded participation in the decision-making process and finally took to squatting in basements sulking. 
An impoverished hitch-hiker visiting any planets in the Sirius star system these days can pick up easy money working as a counsellor for neurotic elevators. 
At the fifteenth floor the elevator doors opened quickly. 
"Fifteenth," said the elevator, "and remember, I'm only doing this because I like your robot." 
Zaphod and Marvin bundled out of the elevator which instantly snapped its doors shut and dropped as fast as its mechanism would take it. 
Zaphod looked around warily. The corridor was deserted and silent and gave no clue as to where Zarniwoop might be found. All the doors that led off the corridor were closed and unmarked. 
They were standing close to the bridge which led across from one tower of the building to the other. Through a large window the brilliant sun of Ursa Minor Beta threw blocks of light in which danced small specks of dust. A shadow flitted past momentarily. 
"Left in the lurch by a lift," muttered Zaphod, who was feeling at his least jaunty. 
They both stood and looked in both directions.â¨"You know something?" said Zaphod to Marvin.â¨"More that you can possibly imagine."â¨"I'm dead certain this building shouldn't be shaking," Zaphod said. 
It was just a light tremor through the soles of his feet and another one. In the sunbeams the flecks of dust danced more vigorously. Another shadow flitted past. 
Zaphod looked at the floor. 
"Either," he said, not very confidently, "they've got some vibro system for toning up your muscles while you work, or..." 
He walked across to the window and suddenly stumbled because at that moment his Joo Janta 200 Super-Chromatic Peril Sensitive sunglasses had turned utterly black. A large shadow flitted past the window with a sharp buzz. 
Zaphod ripped off his sunglasses, and as he did so the building shook with a thunderous roar. He leapt to the window. 
"Or," he said, "this building's being bombed!" 
Another roar cracked through the building. 
"Who in the Galaxy would want to bomb a publishing company?" asked Zaphod, but never heard Marvin's reply because at that moment the building shook with another bomb attack. He tried to stagger back to the elevator a pointless manoeuvre he realized, but the only one he could think of. 
Suddenly, at the end of the corridor leading at right angles from this one, he caught sight of a figure as it lunged into view, a man. The man saw him. 
"Beeblebrox, over here!" he shouted. 
Zaphod eyed him with distrust as another bomb blast rocked the building. 
"No," called Zaphod, "Beeblebrox over here! Who are you?" 
"A friend!" shouted back the man. He ran towards Zaphod. 
"Oh yeah?" said Zaphod, "Anyone's friend in particular, or just generally well disposed of people?" 
The man raced along the corridor, the floor bucking beneath his feet like an excited blanket. He was short, stocky and weatherbeaten and his clothes looked as if they'd been twice round the Galaxy and back with him in them. 
"Do you know," Zaphod shouted in his ear when he arrived, "your building's being bombed?" 
The man indicated his awareness. 
It suddenly stopped being light. Glancing round at the window to see why, Zaphod gaped as a huge sluglike, gunmetal-green spacecraft crept through the air past the building. Two more followed it. 
"The government you deserted is out to get you, Zaphod," hissed the man, "they've sent a squadron of Frogstar Fighters." 
"Frogstar Fighters!" muttered Zaphod, "Zarquon!" 
"You get the picture?" 
"What are Frogstar Fighters?" Zaphod was sure he'd heard someone talk about them when he was President, but he never paid much attention to official matters. 
The man was pulling him back through a door. He went with him. With a searing whine a small black spider-like object shot through the air and disappeared down the corridor. 
"What was that?" hissed Zaphod. 
"Frogstar Scout robot class A out looking for you," said the man. 
"Hey yeah?" 
"Get down!" 
From the opposite direction came a larger black spider-like object. It zapped past them. 
"And that was...?"â¨"A Frogstar Scout robot class B out looking for you."â¨"And that?" said Zaphod, as a third one seared through the air. "A Frogstar Scout robot class C out looking for you."â¨"Hey," chuckled Zaphod to himself, "pretty stupid robots eh?" 
From over the bridge came a massive rumbling hum. A gigantic black shape was moving over it from the opposite tower, the size and shape of a tank. 
"Holy photon, what's that?" 
"A tank," said the man, "Frogstar Scout robot class D come to get you." 
"Should we leave?" 
"I think we should." 
"Marvin!" called Zaphod. 
"What do you want?" 
Marvin rose from a pile of rubble further down the corridor and looked at them. 
"You see that robot coming towards us?" 
Marvin looked at the gigantic black shape edging forward towards them over the bridge. He looked down at his own small metal body. He looked back up at the tank. 
"I suppose you want me to stop it," he said. 
"Yeah." 
"Whilst you save your skins." 
"Yeah," said Zaphod, "get in there!" 
"Just so long," said Marvin, "as I know where I stand." 
The man tugged at Zaphod's arm, and Zaphod followed him off down the corridor. 
A point occurred to him about this. "Where are we going?" he said. "Zarniwoop's office."â¨"Is this any time to keep an appointment?" "Come on." 
Chapter 7 
Marvin stood at the end of the bridge corridor. He was not in fact a particularly small robot. His silver body gleamed in the dusty sunbeams and shook with the continual barrage which the building was still undergoing. 
He did, however, look pitifully small as the gigantic black tank rolled to a halt in front of him. The tank examined him with a probe. The probe withdrew. 
Marvin stood there.â¨"Out of my way little robot," growled the tank.â¨"I'm afraid," said Marvin, "that I've been left here to stop you." The probe extended again for a quick recheck. It withdrew again. "You? Stop me?" roared the tank. "Go on!"â¨"No, really I have," said Marvin simply.â¨"What are you armed with?" roared the tank in disbelief. "Guess," said Marvin. 
The tank's engines rumbled, its gears ground. Molecule-sized electronic relays deep in its micro-brain flipped backwards and forwards in consternation. 
"Guess?" said the tank. 
Zaphod and the as yet unnamed man lurched up one corridor, down a second and along a third. The building continued to rock and judder and this puzzled Zaphod. If they wanted to blow the building up, why was it taking so long? 
With difficulty they reached one of a number of totally anonymous unmarked doors and heaved at it. With a sudden jolt it opened and they fell inside. 
All this way, thought Zaphod, all this trouble, all this not-lying-on- the-beach-having-a-wonderful-time, and for what? A single chair, a single desk and a single dirty ashtray in an undecorated office. The 
desk, apart from a bit of dancing dust and single, revolutionary form of paper clip, was empty. 
"Where," said Zaphod, "is Zarniwoop?" feeling that his already tenuous grasp of the point of this whole exercise was beginning to slip. 
"He's on an intergalactic cruise," said the man. 
Zaphod tried to size the man up. Earnest type, he thought, not a barrel of laughs. He probably apportioned a fair whack of his time to running up and down heaving corridors, breaking down doors and making cryptic remarks in empty offices. 
"Let me introduce myself," the man said, "My name is Roosta, and this is my towel." 
"Hello Roosta," said Zaphod. 
"Hello, towel," he added as Roosta held out to him a rather nasty old flowery towel. Not knowing what to do with it, he shook it by the corner. 
Outside the window, one of the huge slug-like, gunmetal-green spaceships growled past. 
"Yes, go on," said Marvin to the huge battle machine, "you'll never guess." 
"Errmmm..." said the machine, vibrating with unaccustomed thought, "laser beams?" 
Marvin shook his head solemnly. 
"No," muttered the machine in its deep guttural rumble, "Too obvious. Anti-matter ray?" it hazarded. 
"Far too obvious," admonished Marvin. 
"Yes," grumbled the machine, somewhat abashed, "Er... how about an electron ram?" 
This was new to Marvin.â¨"What's that?" he said.â¨"One of these," said the machine with enthusiasm. 
From its turret emerged a sharp prong which spat a single lethal blaze of light. Behind Marvin a wall roared and collapsed as a heap of dust. The dust billowed briefly, then settled. 
"No," said Marvin, "not one of those." "Good though, isn't it?" 
"Very good," agreed Marvin. 
"I know," said the Frogstar battle machine, after another moment's consideration, "you must have one of those new Xanthic Re-Structron Destabilized Zenon Emitters!" 
"Nice, aren't they?" said Marvin.â¨"That's what you've got?" said the machine in considerable awe. "No," said Marvin.â¨"Oh," said the machine, disappointed, "then it must be..." 
"You're thinking along the wrong lines," said Marvin, "You're failing to take into account something fairly basic in the relationship between men and robots." 
"Er, I know," said the battle machine, "is it..." it tailed off into thought again. 
"Just think," urged Marvin, "they left me, an ordinary, menial robot, to stop you, a gigantic heavy-duty battle machine, whilst they ran off to save themselves. What do you think they would leave me with?" 
"Oooh, er," muttered the machine in alarm, "something pretty damn devastating I should expect." 
"Expect!" said Marvin, "oh yes, expect. I'll tell you what they gave me to protect myself with shall I." 
"Yes, alright," said the battle machine, bracing itself. "Nothing," said Marvin.â¨There was a dangerous pause.â¨"Nothing?" roared the battle machine. 
"Nothing at all," intoned Marvin dismally, "not an electronic sausage." 
The machine heaved about with fury. 
"Well, doesn't that just take the biscuit!" it roared, "Nothing, eh? Just don't think, do they?" 
"And me," said Marvin in a soft low voice, "with this terrible pain in all the diodes down my left side." 
"Makes you spit, doesn't it?" 
"Yes," agreed Marvin with feeling. 
"Hell that makes me angry," bellowed the machine, "think I'll smash that wall down!" 
The electron ram stabbed out another searing blaze of light and took out the wall next to the machine. 
"How do you think I feel?" said Marvin bitterly. 
"Just ran off and left you, did they?" the machine thundered. 
"Yes," said Marvin. 
"I think I'll shoot down their bloody ceiling as well!" raged the tank. 
It took out the ceiling of the bridge. 
"That's very impressive," murmured Marvin. 
"You ain't seeing nothing yet," promised the machine, "I can take out this floor too, no trouble!" 
It took out the floor, too. 
"Hell's bells!" the machine roared as it plummeted fifteen storeys and smashed itself to bits on the ground below. 
"What a depressingly stupid machine," said Marvin and trudged away. 
Chapter 8 
"So, do we just sit here, or what?" said Zaphod angrily, "what do these guys out here want?" 
"You, Beeblebrox," said Roosta, "they're going to take you to the Frogstar the most totally evil world in the Galaxy." 
"Oh, yeah?" said Zaphod. "They'll have to come and get me first." 
"They have come and got you," said Roosta, "look out of the window." 
Zaphod looked, and gaped. 
"The ground's going away!" he gasped, "where are they taking the ground?" 
"They're taking the building," said Roosta, "we're airborne." 
Clouds streaked past the office window. 
Out in the open air again Zaphod could see the ring of dark green Frogstar Fighters round the uprooted tower of the building. A network of force beams radiated in from them and held the tower in a firm grip. 
Zaphod shook his head in perplexity. 
"What have I done to deserve this?" he said, "I walk into a building, they take it away." 
"It's not what you've done they're worried about," said Roosta, "it's what you're going to do." 
"Well don't I get a say in that?" 
"You did, years ago. You'd better hold on, we're in for a fast and bumpy journey." 
"If I ever meet myself," said Zaphod, "I'll hit myself so hard I won't know what's hit me." 
Marvin trudged in through the door, looked at Zaphod accusingly, slumped in a corner and switched himself off. 
On the bridge of the Heart of Gold, all was silent. Arthur stared at the rack in front of him and thought. He caught Trillian's eyes as she looked at him inquiringly. He looked back at the rack. 
Finally he saw it. 
He picked up five small plastic squares and laid them on the board that lay just in front of the rack. 
The five squares had on them the five letters E, X, Q, U and I. He laid them next to the letters S, I, T, E. 
"Exquisite," he said, "on a triple word score. Scores rather a lot I'm afraid." 
The ship bumped and scattered some of the letters for the 'n'th time. 
Trillian sighed and started to sort them out again. 
Up and down the silent corridors echoed Ford Prefect's feet as he stalked the ship thumping dead instruments. 
Why did the ship keep shaking? he thought. Why did it rock and sway?â¨Why could he not find out where they were? Where, basically, were they? 
The left-hand tower of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy offices streaked through interstellar space at a speed never equalled either before or since by any other office block in the Universe. 
In a room halfway up it, Zaphod Beeblebrox strode angrily. 
Roosta sat on the edge of the desk doing some routine towel maintenance. 
"Hey, where did you say this building was flying to?" demanded Zaphod. 
"The Frogstar," said Roosta, "the most totally evil place in the Universe." 
"Do they have food there?" said Zaphod. 
"Food? You're going to the Frogstar and you're worried about whether they got food?" 
"Without food I may not make it to the Frogstar." 
Out of the window, they could see nothing but the flickering light of the force beams, and vague green streaks which were presumably the distorted shapes of the Frogstar Fighters. At this speed, space itself was invisible, and indeed unreal. 
"Here, suck this," said Roosta, offering Zaphod his towel. 
Zaphod stared at him as if he expected a cuckoo to leap out of his forehead on a small spring. 
"It's soaked in nutrients," explained Roosta. 
"What are you, a messy eater or something?" said Zaphod. 
"The yellow stripes are high in protein, the green ones have vitamin B and C complexes, the little pink flowers contain wheatgerm extracts." 
Zaphod took and looked at it in amazement. 
"What are the brown stains?" he asked. 
"Bar-B-Q sauce," said Roosta, "for when I get sick of wheatgerm." 
Zaphod sniffed it doubtfully. 
Even more doubtfully, he sucked a corner. He spat it out again. 
"Ugh," he stated. 
"Yes," said Roosta, "when I've had to suck that end I usually need to suck the other end a bit too." 
"Why," asked Zaphod suspiciously, "what's in that?" 
"Anti-depressants," said Roosta. 
"I've gone right off this towel, you know," said Zaphod handing it back. 
Roosta took it back from him, swung himself off the desk, walked round it, sat in the chair and put his feet up. 
"Beeblebrox," he said, sticking his hands behind his head, "have you any idea what's going to happen to you on the Frogstar?" 
"They're going to feed me?" hazarded Zaphod hopefully. 
"They're going to feed you," said Roosta, "into the Total Perspective Vortex!" 
Zaphod had never heard of this. He believed that he had heard of all the fun things in the Galaxy, so he assumed that the Total Perspective Vortex was not fun. He asked what it was. 
"Only," said Roosta, "the most savage psychic torture a sentinent being can undergo." 
Zaphod nodded a resigned nod. 
"So," he said, "no food, huh?" 
"Listen!" said Roosta urgently, "you can kill a man, destroy his body, break his spirit, but only the Total Perspective Vortex can annihilate a man's soul! The treatment lasts seconds, but the effect lasts the rest of your life!" 
"You ever had a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster?" asked Zaphod sharply. "This is worse."â¨"Phreeow!" admitted Zaphod, much impressed.â¨"Any idea why these guys might want to do this to me?" he added 
a moment later. 
"They believe it will be the best way of destroying you for ever. They know what you're after." 
"Could they drop me a note and let me know as well?" 
"You know," said Roosta, "you know, Beeblebrox. You want to meet the man who rules the Universe." 
"Can he cook?" said Zaphod. On reflection he added: 
"I doubt if he can. If he could cook a good meal he wouldn't worry about the rest of the Universe. I want to meet a cook." 
Roosta sighed heavily. 
"What are you doing here anyway?" demanded Zaphod, "what's all this got to so with you?" 
"I'm just one of those who planned this thing, along with Zarniwoop, along with Yooden Vranx, along with your great grandfather, along with you, Beeblebrox." 
"Me?"â¨"Yes, you. I was told you had changed, I didn't realize how much." "But..."â¨"I am here to do one job. I will do it before I leave you."â¨"What job, man, what are you talking about?"â¨"I will do it before I leave you." 
Roosta lapsed into an impenetrable silence. Zaphod was terribly glad. 
Chapter 9 
The air around the second planet of the Frogstar system was stale and unwholesome. 
The dank winds that swept continually over its surface swept over salt flats, dried up marshland, tangled and rotting vegetation and the crumbling remains of ruined cities. No life moved across its surface. The ground, like that of many planets in this part of the Galaxy, had long been deserted. 
The howl of the wind was desolate enough as it gusted through the old decaying houses of the cities; it was more desolate as it whipped about the bottoms of the tall black towers that swayed uneasily here and there about the surface of this world. At the top of these towers lived colonies of large, scraggy, evil smelling birds, the sole survivors of the civilization that once lived here. 
The howl of the wind was at its most desolate, however, when it passed over a pimple of a place set in the middle of a wide grey plain on the outskirts of the largest of the abandoned cities. 
This pimple of a place was the thing that had earned this world the reputation of being the most totally evil place in the Galaxy. From without it was simply a steel dome about thirty feet across. From within it was something more monstrous than the mind can comprehend. 
About a hundred yards or so away, and separated from it by a pockmarked and blasted stretch of the most barren land imaginable was what would probably have to be described as a landing pad of sorts. That is to say that scattered over a largish area were the ungainly hulks of two or three dozen crash-landed buildings. 
Flitting over and around these buildings was a mind, a mind that was waiting for something. 
The mind directed its attention into the air, and before very long a distant speck appeared, surrounded by a ring of smaller specks. 
The larger speck was the left-hand tower of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy office building, descending through the stratosphere of Frogstar World B. 
As it descended, Roosta suddenly broke the long uncomfortable silence that had grown up between the two men. 
He stood up and gathered his towel into a bag. He said: 
"Beeblebrox, I will now do the job I was sent here to do." 
Zaphod looked up at him from where he was sitting in a corner sharing unspoken thoughts with Marvin. 
"Yeah?" he said. 
"The building will shortly be landing. When you leave the building, do not go out of the door," said Roosta, "go out of the window." 
"Good luck," he added, and walked out of the door, disappearing from Zaphod's life as mysteriously as he had entered it. 
Zaphod leapt up and tried the door, but Roosta had already locked it. He shrugged and returned to the corner. 
Two minutes later, the building crashlanded amongst the other wreckage. Its escort of Frogstar Fighters deactivated their force beams and soared off into the air again, bound for Frogstar World A, an altogether more congenial spot. They never landed on Frogstar World B. No one did. No one ever walked on its surface other than the intended victims of the Total Perspective Vortex. 
Zaphod was badly shaken by the crash. He lay for a while in the silent dusty rubble to which most of the room had been reduced. He felt that he was at the lowest ebb he had ever reached in his life. He felt bewildered, he felt lonely, he felt unloved. Eventually he felt he ought to get whatever it was over with. 
He looked around the cracked and broken room. The wall had split round the door frame, and the door hung open. The window, by some miracle was closed and unbroken. For a while he hesitated, then he thought that if his strange and recent companion had been through all that he had been through just to tell him what he had told him, then there must be a good reason for it. With Marvin's help he got the window open. Outside it, the cloud of dust aroused by the crash, and the hulks of the other buildings with which this one was surrounded, effectively prevented Zaphod from seeing anything of the world outside. 
Not that this concerned him unduly. His main concern was what he saw when he looked down. Zarniwoop's office was on the fifteenth floor. The building had landed at a tilt of about forty-five degrees, but still the descent looked heart-stopping. 
Eventually, stung by the continuous series of contemptuous looks that Marvin appeared to be giving him, he took a deep breath and clambered out on to the steeply inclined side of the building. Marvin followed him, and together they began to crawl slowly and painfully down the fifteen floors that separated them from the ground. 
As he crawled, the dank air and dust choked his lungs, his eyes smarted and the terrifying distance down made his heads spin. 
The occasional remark from Marvin of the order of "This is the sort of thing you lifeforms enjoy is it? I ask merely for information," did little to improve his state of mind. 
About half-way down the side of the shattered building they stopped to rest. It seemed to Zaphod as he lay there panting with fear and exhaustion that Marvin seemed a mite more cheerful than usual. Eventually he realized this wasn't so. The robot just seemed cheerful in comparison with his own mood. 
A large, scraggy black bird came flapping through the slowly settling clouds of dust and, stretching down its scrawny legs, landed on an inclined window ledge a couple of yards from Zaphod. It folded its ungainly wings and teetered awkwardly on its perch. 
Its wingspan must have been something like six feet, and its head and neck seemed curiously large for a bird. Its face was flat, the beak underdeveloped, and half-way along the underside of its wings the vestiges of something handlike could be clearly seen. 
In fact, it looked almost human. 
It turned its heavy eyes on Zaphod and clicked its beak in a desultory fashion. 
"Go away," said Zaphod. 
"OK," muttered the bird morosely and flapped off into the dust again. 
Zaphod watched its departure in bewilderment. 
"Did that bird just talk to me?" he asked Marvin nervously. He was quite prepared to believe the alternative explanation, that he was in fact hallucinating. 
"Yes," confirmed Marvin. 
"Poor souls," said a deep, ethereal voice in Zaphod's ear. 
Twisting round violently to find the source of the voice nearly caused Zaphod to fall off the building. He grabbed savagely at a protruding window fitting and cut his hand on it. He hung on, breathing heavily. 
The voice had no visible source whatever there was no one there. Nevertheless, it spoke again. 
"A tragic history behind them, you know. A terrible blight." 
Zaphod looked wildly about. The voice was deep and quiet. In other circumstances it would even be described as soothing. There is, however, nothing soothing about being addressed by a disembodied voice out of nowhere, particularly if you are, like Zaphod Beeblebrox, not at your best and hanging from a ledge eight storeys up a crashed building. 
"Hey, er..." he stammered. 
"Shall I tell you their story?" inquired the voice quietly. 
"Hey, who are you?" panted Zaphod. "Where are you?" 
"Later then, perhaps," murmured the voice. "I am Gargravarr. I am the Custodian of the Total Perspective Vortex." 
"Why can't I see..." 
"You will find your progress down the building greatly facilitated," the voice lifted, "if you move about two yards to your left. Why don't you try it?" 
Zaphod looked and saw a series of short horizontal grooves leading all the way down the side of the building. Gratefully he shifted himself across to them. 
"Why don't I see you again at the bottom?" said the voice in his ear, and as it spoke it faded. 
"Hey," called out Zaphod, "Where are you..." 
"It'll only take a couple of minutes..." said the voice very faintly. 
"Marvin," said Zaphod earnestly to the robot squatting dejectedly next to him, "Did a... did a voice just..." 
"Yes," Marvin replied tersely. 
Zaphod nodded. He took out his Peril Sensitive Sunglasses again. They were completely black, and by now quite badly scratched by the 
unexpected metal object in his pocket. He put them on. He would find his way down the building more comfortably if he didn't actually have to look at what he was doing. 
Minutes later he clambered over the ripped and mangled foundations of the building and, once more removing his sunglasses, he dropped to the ground. 
Marvin joined him a moment or so later and lay face down in the dust and rubble, from which position he seemed too disinclined to move. 
"Ah, there you are," said the voice suddenly in Zaphod's ear, "excuse me leaving you like that, it's just that I have a terrible head for heights. At least," it added wistfully, "I did have a terrible head for heights." 
Zaphod looked around slowly and carefully, just to see if he had missed something which might be the source of the voice. All he saw, however, was the dust, the rubble and the towering hulks of the encircling buildings. 
"Hey, er, why can't I see you?" he said, "why aren't you here?" 
"I am here," said the voice slowly, "my body wanted to come but it's a bit busy at the moment. Things to do, people to see." After what seemed like a sort of ethereal sigh it added, "You know how it is with bodies." 
Zaphod wasn't sure about this. 
"I thought I did," he said. 
"I only hope it's gone for a rest cure," continued the voice, "the way it's been living recently it must be on its last elbows." 
"Elbows?" said Zaphod, "don't you mean last legs?" 
The voice said nothing for a while. Zaphod looked around uneasily. He didn't know if it was gone or was still there or what it was doing. Then the voice spoke again. 
"So, you are to be put into the Vortex, yes?" 
"Er, well," said Zaphod with a very poor attempt at nonchalance, "this cat's in no hurry, you know. I can just slouch about and take in a look at the local scenery, you know?" 
"Have you seen the local scenery?" asked the voice of Gargravarr. "Er, no." 
Zaphod clambered over the rubble, and rounded the corner of one of the wrecked buildings that was obscuring his view. 
He looked out at the landscape of Frogstar World B. 
"Ah, OK," he said, "I'll just sort of slouch about then." 
"No," said Gargravarr, "the Vortex is ready for you now. You must come. Follow me." 
"Er, yeah?" said Zaphod, "and how am I meant to do that?" 
"I'll hum for you," said Gargravarr, "follow the humming." 
A soft keening sound drifted through the air, a pale, sad sound that seemed to be without any kind of focus. It was only by listening very carefully that Zaphod was able to detect the direction from which it was coming. Slowly, dazedly, he stumbled off in its wake. What else was there to do? 
Chapter 10 
The Universe, as has been observed before, is an unsettlingly big place, a fact which for the sake of a quiet life most people tend to ignore. 
Many would happily move to somewhere rather smaller of their own devising, and this is what most beings in fact do. 
For instance, in one corner of the Eastern Galactic Arm lies the large forest planet Oglaroon, the entire "intelligent" population of which lives permanently in one fairly small and crowded nut tree. In which tree they are born, live, fall in love, carve tiny speculative articles in the bark on the meaning of life, the futility of death and the importance of birth control, fight a few extremely minor wars, and eventually die strapped to the underside of some of the less accessible outer branches. 
In fact the only Oglaroonians who ever leave their tree are those who are hurled out of it for the heinous crime of wondering whether any of the other trees might be capable of supporting life at all, or indeed whether the other trees are anything other than illusions brought on by eating too many Oglanuts. 
Exotic though this behaviour may seem, there is no life form in the Galaxy which is not in some way guilty of the same thing, which is why the Total Perspective Vortex is as horrific as it is. 
For when you are put into the Vortex you are given just one momentary glimpse of the entire unimaginable infinity of creation, and somewhere in it a tiny little marker, a microscopic dot on a microscopic dot, which says "You are here." 
The grey plain stretched before Zaphod, a ruined, shattered plain. The wind whipped wildly over it. 
Visible in the middle was the steel pimple of the dome. This, gathered Zaphod, was where he was going. This was the Total Perspective Vortex. 
As he stood and gazed bleakly at it, a sudden inhuman wail of terror emanated from it as of a man having his soul burnt from his body. It screamed above the wind and died away. 
Zaphod started with fear and his blood seemed to turn to liquid helium. 
"Hey, what was that?" he muttered voicelessly. 
"A recording," said Gargravarr, "of the last man who was put in the Vortex. It is always played to the next victim. A sort of prelude." 
"Hey, it really sounds bad..." stammered Zaphod, "couldn't we maybe slope off to a party or something for a while, think it over?" 
"For all I know," said Gargravarr's ethereal voice, "I'm probably at one. My body that is. It goes to a lot of parties without me. Says I only get in the way. Hey ho." 
"What is all this with your body?" said Zaphod, anxious to delay whatever it was that was going to happen to him. 
"Well, it's... it's busy you know," said Gargravarr hesitantly. 
"You mean it's got a mind of its own?" said Zaphod. 
There was a long and slightly chilly pause before Gargravarr spoke again. 
"I have to say," he replied eventually, "that I find that remark in rather poor taste." 
Zaphod muttered a bewildered and embarrassed apology. "No matter," said Gargravarr, "you weren't to know."â¨The voice fluttered unhappily. 
"The truth is," it continued in tones which suggested he was trying very hard to keep it under control, "the truth is that we are currently undergoing a period of legal trial separation. I suspect it will end in divorce." 
The voice was still again, leaving Zaphod with no idea of what to say. He mumbled uncertainly. 
"I think we are probably not very well suited," said Gargravarrâ¨again at length, "we never seemed to be happy doing the same things. We always had the greatest arguments over sex and fishing.â¨Eventually we tried to combine the two, but that only led to disaster, as you can probably imagine. And now my body refuses to let me in. It won't even see me..." 
He paused again, tragically. The wind whipped across the plain. 
"It says I only inhibit it. I pointed out that in fact I was meant to inhibit it, and it said that that was exactly the sort of smart alec remark that got right up a body's left nostril, and so we left it. It will probably get custody of my forename." 
"Oh..." said Zaphod faintly, "and what's that?" 
"Pizpot," said the voice, "My name is Pizpot Gargravarr. Says it all really doesn't it?" 
"Errr..." said Zaphod sympathetically. 
"And that is why I, as a disembodied mind, have this job, Custodian of the Total Perspective Vortex. No one will ever walk on the ground of this planet. Except the victims of the Vortex they don't really count I'm afraid." 
"Ah..."â¨"I'll tell you the story. Would you like to hear it?" "Er..." 
"Many years ago this was a thriving, happy planet people, cities shops, a normal world. Except that on the high streets of these cities there were slightly more shoe shops than one might have thought necessary. And slowly, insidiously, the numbers of these shoe shops were increasing. It's a well known economic phenomenon but tragic to see it in operation, for the more shoe shops there were, the more shoes they had to make and the worse and more unwearable they became. And the worse they were to wear, the more people had to buy to keep themselves shod, and the more the shops proliferated, until the whole economy of the place passed what I believe is termed the Shoe Event Horizon, and it became no longer economically possible to build anything other than shoe shops. Result collapse, ruin and famine. Most of the population died out. Those few who had the right kind of genetic instability mutated into birds you've seen one of them who cursed their feet, cursed the ground, and vowed that none should walk on it again. Unhappy lot. Come, I must take you to the Vortex." 
Zaphod shook his head in bemusement and stumbled forward across the plain. 
"And you," he said, "you come from this hellhole pit do you?" 
"No no," said Gargravarr, taken aback, "I come from the Frogstar World C. Beautiful place. Wonderful fishing. I flit back there in the evenings. Though all I can do now is watch. The Total Perspective Vortex is the only thing on this planet with any function. It was built here because no one else wanted it on their doorstep." 
At that moment another dismal scream rent the air and Zaphod shuddered. 
"What can do that to a guy?" he breathed. 
"The Universe," said Gargravarr simply, "the whole infinite Universe. The infinite suns, the infinite distances between them, and yourself an invisible dot on an invisible dot, infinitely small." 
"Hey, I'm Zaphod Beeblebrox, man, you know," muttered Zaphod trying to flap the last remnants of his ego. 
Gargravarr made no reply, but merely resumed his mournful humming till they reached the tarnished steel dome in the middle of the plain. 
As they reached it, a door hummed open in the side, revealing a small darkened chamber within. 
"Enter," said Gargravarr. Zaphod started with fear. "Hey, what, now?" he said. "Now." 
Zaphod peered nervously inside. The chamber was very small. It was steel-lined and there was hardly space in it for more than one man. 
"It... er... it doesn't look like any kind of Vortex to me," said Zaphod. 
"It isn't," said Gargravarr, "it's just the elevator. Enter." 
With infinite trepidation Zaphod stepped into it. He was aware of Gargravarr being in the elevator with him, though the disembodied man was not for the moment speaking. 
The elevator began its descent. 
"I must get myself into the right frame of mind for this," muttered Zaphod. 
"There is no right frame of mind," said Gargravarr sternly. "You really know how to make a guy feel inadequate."â¨"I don't. The Vortex does." 
At the bottom of the shaft, the rear of the elevator opened up and Zaphod stumbled out into a smallish, functional, steel-lined chamber. 
At the far side of it stood a single upright steel box, just large enough for a man to stand in. 
It was that simple. 
It connected to a small pile of components and instruments via a single thick wire. 
"Is that it?" said Zaphod in surprise. 
"That is it." 
Didn't look too bad, thought Zaphod. 
"And I get in there do I?" said Zaphod. 
"You get in there," said Gargravarr, "and I'm afraid you must do it now." 
"OK, OK," said Zaphod.â¨He opened the door of the box and stepped in. Inside the box he waited. 
After five seconds there was a click, and the entire Universe was there in the box with him. 
Chapter 11 
The Total Perspective Vortex derives its picture of the whole Universe on the principle of extrapolated matter analyses. 
To explain since every piece of matter in the Universe is in some way affected by every other piece of matter in the Universe, it is in theory possible to extrapolate the whole of creation every sun, every planet, their orbits, their composition and their economic and social history from, say, one small piece of fairy cake. 
The man who invented the Total Perspective Vortex did so basically in order to annoy his wife. 
Trin Tragula for that was his name was a dreamer, a thinker, a speculative philosopher or, as his wife would have it, an idiot. 
And she would nag him incessantly about the utterly inordinate amount of time he spent staring out into space, or mulling over the mechanics of safety pins, or doing spectrographic analyses of pieces of fairy cake. 
"Have some sense of proportion!" she would say, sometimes as often as thirty-eight times in a single day. 
And so he built the Total Perspective Vortex just to show her. 
And into one end he plugged the whole of reality as extrapolated from a piece of fairy cake, and into the other end he plugged his wife: so that when he turned it on she saw in one instant the whole infinity of creation and herself in relation to it. 
To Trin Tragula's horror, the shock completely annihilated her brain; but to his satisfaction he realized that he had proved conclusively that if life is going to exist in a Universe of this size, then the one thing it cannot afford to have is a sense of proportion. 
The door of the Vortex swung open. 
From his disembodied mind Gargravarr watched dejectedly. He had rather liked Zaphod Beeblebrox in a strange sort of way. He was clearly a man of many qualities, even if they were mostly bad ones. 
He waited for him to flop forwards out of the box, as they all did. Instead, he stepped out.â¨"Hi!" he said.â¨"Beeblebrox..." gasped Gargravarr's mind in amazement. 
"Could I have a drink please?" said Zaphod. 
"You... you... have been in the Vortex?" stammered Gargravarr. 
"You saw me, kid." 
"And it was working?" 
"Sure was." 
"And you saw the whole infinity of creation?" 
"Sure. Really neat place, you know that?" 
Gargravarr's mind was reeling in astonishment. Had his body been with him it would have sat down heavily with its mouth hanging open. 
"And you saw yourself," said Gargravarr, "in relation to it all?" "Oh, yeah, yeah."â¨"But... what did you experience?"â¨Zaphod shrugged smugly. 
"It just told me what I knew all the time. I'm a really terrific and great guy. Didn't I tell you, baby, I'm Zaphod Beeblebrox!" 
His gaze passed over the machinery which powered the vortex and suddenly stopped, startled. 
He breathed heavily. 
"Hey," he said, "is that really a piece of fairy cake?" 
He ripped the small piece of confectionery from the sensors with which it was surrounded. 
"If I told you how much I needed this," he said ravenously, "I wouldn't have time to eat it." 
He ate it. 
Chapter 12 
A short while later he was running across the plain in the direction of the ruined city. 
The dank air wheezed heavily in his lungs and he frequently stumbled with the exhaustion he was still feeling. Night was beginning to fall too, and the rough ground was treacherous. 
The elation of his recent experience was still with him though. The whole Universe. He had seen the whole Universe stretching to infinity around him everything. And with it had come the clear and extraordinary knowledge that he was the most important thing in it. Having a conceited ego is one thing. Actually being told by a machine is another. 
He didn't have time to reflect on this matter. 
Gargravarr had told him that he would have to alert his masters as to what had happened, but that he was prepared to leave a decent interval before doing so. Enough time for Zaphod to make a break and find somewhere to hide. 
What he was going to do he didn't know, but feeling that he was the most important person in the Universe gave him the confidence to believe that something would turn up. 
Nothing else on this blighted planet could give him much grounds for optimism. 
He ran on, and soon reached the outskirts of the abandoned city. 
He walked along cracked and gaping roads riddled with scrawny weeds, the holes filled with rotting shoes. The buildings he passed were so crumbled and decrepit he thought it unsafe to enter any of them. Where could he hide? He hurried on. 
After a while the remains of a wide sweeping road led off from the one down which he was walking, and at its end lay a vast low building, surrounded with sundry smaller ones, the whole surrounded by the remains of a perimeter barrier. The large main building still seemed 
reasonably solid, and Zaphod turned off to see if it might provide him with... well with anything. 
He approached the building. Along one side of it the front it would seem since it faced a wide concreted apron area were three gigantic doors, maybe sixty feet high. The far one of these was open, and towards this, Zaphod ran. 
Inside, all was gloom, dust and confusion. Giant cobwebs lay over everything. Part of the infrastructure of the building had collapsed, part of the rear wall had caved in, and a thick choking dust lay inches over the floor. 
Through the heavy gloom huge shapes loomed, covered with debris. 
The shapes were sometimes cylindrical, sometimes bulbous, sometimes like eggs, or rather cracked eggs. Most of them were split open or falling apart, some were mere skeletons. 
They were all spacecraft, all derelict. 
Zaphod wandered in frustration among the hulks. There was nothing here that remotely approached the serviceable. Even the mere vibration of his footsteps caused one precarious wreck to collapse further into itself. 
Towards the rear of the building lay one old ship, slightly larger than the others, and buried beneath even deeper piles of dust and cobwebs. Its outline, however, seemed unbroken. Zaphod approached it with interest, and as he did so, he tripped over an old feedline. 
He tried to toss the feedline aside, and to his surprise discovered that it was still connected to the ship. 
To his utter astonishment he realized that the feedline was also humming slightly. 
He stared at the ship in disbelief, and then back down at the feedline in his hands. 
He tore off his jacket and threw it aside. Crawling along on his hands and knees he followed the feedline to the point where it connected with the ship. The connection was sound, and the slight humming vibration was more distinct. 
His heart was beating fast. He wiped away some grime and laid an ear against the ship's side. He could only hear a faint, indeterminate noise. 
He rummaged feverishly amongst the debris lying on the floor all about him and found a short length of tubing, and a non- biodegradable plastic cup. Out of this he fashioned a crude stethoscope and placed it against the side of the ship. 
What he heard made his brains turn somersaults. 
The voice said: 
"Transtellar Cruise Lines would like to apologize to passengers for the continuing delay to this flight. We are currently awaiting the loading of our complement of small lemon-soaked paper napkins for your comfort, refreshment and hygiene during the journey. Meanwhile we thank you for your patience. The cabin crew will shortly be serving coffee and biscuits again." 
Zaphod staggered backwards, staring wildly at the ship. 
He walked around for a few moments in a daze. In so doing he suddenly caught sight of a giant departure board still hanging, but by only one support, from the ceiling above him. It was covered with grime, but some of the figures were still discernible. 
Zaphod's eyes searched amongst the figures, then made some brief calculations. His eyes widened. 
"Nine hundred years..." he breathed to himself. That was how late the ship was. 
Two minutes later he was on board. 
As he stepped out of the airlock, the air that greeted him was cool and fresh the air conditioning was still working. 
The lights were still on. 
He moved out of the small entrance chamber into a short narrow corridor and stepped nervously down it. 
Suddenly a door opened and a figure stepped out in front of him. 
"Please return to your seat sir," said the android stewardess and, turning her back on him, she walked on down the corridor in front of him. 
When his heart had started beating again he followed her. She opened the door at the end of the corridor and walked through. 
He followed her through the door. 
They were now in the passenger compartment and Zaphod's heart stopped still again for a moment. 
In every seat sat a passenger, strapped into his or her seat. 
The passengers' hair was long and unkempt, their fingernails were long, the men wore beards. 
All of them were quite clearly alive but sleeping. 
Zaphod had the creeping horrors. 
He walked slowly down the aisle as in a dream. By the time he was half-way down the aisle, the stewardess had reached the other end. She turned and spoke. 
"Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen," she said sweetly, "Thank you for bearing with us during this slight delay. We will be taking off as soon as we possibly can. If you would like to wake up now I will serve you coffee and biscuits." 
There was a slight hum. 
At that moment, all the passengers awoke. 
They awoke screaming and clawing at their straps and life support systems that held them tightly in their seats. They screamed and bawled and hollered till Zaphod thought his ears would shatter. 
They struggled and writhed as the stewardess patiently moved up the aisle placing a small cup of coffee and a packet of biscuits in front of each one of them. 
Then one of them rose from his seat. 
He turned and looked at Zaphod. 
Zaphod's skin was crawling all over his body as if it was trying to get off. He turned and ran from the bedlam. 
He plunged through the door and back into the corridor. 
The man pursued him. 
He raced in a frenzy to the end of the corridor, through the entrance chamber and beyond. He arrived on the flight deck, slammed and bolted the door behind him. He leant back against the door breathing hard. 
Within seconds, a hand started beating on the door.â¨From somewhere on the flight deck a metallic voice addressed him. 
"Passengers are not allowed on the flight deck. Please return to your seat, and wait for the ship to take off. Coffee and biscuits are being served. This is your autopilot speaking. Please return to your seat." 
Zaphod said nothing. He breathed hard, behind him, the hand continued to knock on the door. 
"Please return to your seat," repeated the autopilot. "Passengers are not allowed on the flight deck." 
"I'm not a passenger," panted Zaphod.â¨"Please return to your seat."â¨"I am not a passenger!" shouted Zaphod again. "Please return to your seat."â¨"I am not a... hello, can you hear me?"â¨"Please return to your seat."â¨You're the autopilot?" said Zaphod.â¨"Yes," said the voice from the flight console. "You're in charge of this ship?" 
"Yes," said the voice again, "there has been a delay. Passengers are to be kept temporarily in suspended animation, for their comfort and convenience. Coffee and biscuits are being served every year, after which passengers are returned to suspended animation for their continued comfort and convenience. Departure will take place when the flight stores are complete. We apologize for the delay." 
Zaphod moved away from the door, on which the pounding had now ceased. He approached the flight console. 
"Delay?" he cried, "Have you seen the world outside this ship? It's a wasteland, a desert. Civilization's been and gone, man. There are no lemon-soaked paper napkins on the way from anywhere!" 
"The statistical likelihood," continued the autopilot primly, "is that other civilizations will arise. There will one day be lemon-soaked paper napkins. Till then there will be a short delay. Please return to your seat." 
"But..." 
But at that moment the door opened. Zaphod span round to see the man who had pursued him standing there. He carried a large 
briefcase. He was smartly dressed, and his hair was short. He had no beard and no long fingernails. 
"Zaphod Beeblebrox," he said, "My name is Zarniwoop. I believe you wanted to see me." 
Zaphod Beeblebrox wittered. His mouths said foolish things. He dropped into a chair. 
"Oh man, oh man, where did you spring from?" he said.â¨"I've been waiting here for you," he said in a businesslike tone. He put the briefcase down and sat in another chair. 
"I am glad you followed instructions," he said, "I was a bit nervous that you might have left my office by the door rather than the window. Then you would have been in trouble." 
Zaphod shook his heads at him and burbled. 
"When you entered the door of my office, you entered my electronically synthesized Universe," he explained, "if you had left by the door you would have been back in the real one. The artificial one works from here." 
He patted the briefcase smugly. 
Zaphod glared at him with resentment and loathing. 
"What's the difference?" he muttered. 
"Nothing," said Zarniwoop, "they are identical. Oh except that I think the Frogstar Fighters are grey in the real Universe." 
"What's going on?" spat Zaphod. 
"Simple," said Zarniwoop. His self assurance and smugness made Zaphod seethe. 
"Very simple," repeated Zarniwoop, "I discovered the coordinated at which this man could be found the man who rules the Universe, and discovered that his world was protected by an Unprobability field. To protect my secret and myself I retreated to the safety of this totally artificial Universe and hid myself away in a forgotten cruise liner. I was secure. Meanwhile, you and I..." 
"You and I?" said Zaphod angrily, "you mean I knew you?" "Yes," said Zarniwoop, "we knew each other well."â¨"I had no taste," said Zaphod and resumed a sullen silence. 
"Meanwhile, you and I arranged that you would steal the Improbability Drive ship the only one which could reach the ruler's 
world and bring it to me here. This you have now done I trust, and I congratulate you." He smiled a tight little smile which Zaphod wanted to hit with a brick. 
"Oh, and in case you were wondering," added Zarniwoop, "this Universe was created specifically for you to come to. You are therefore the most important person in this Universe. You would never," he said with an even more brickable smile, "have survived the Total Perspective Vortex in the real one. Shall we go?" 
"Where?" said Zaphod sullenly. He felt collapsed. 
"To your ship. The Heart of Gold. You did bring it I trust?" 
"No." 
"Where is your jacket?" 
Zaphod looked at him in mystification. 
"My jacket? I took it off. It's outside." 
"Good, we will go and find it." 
Zarniwoop stood up and gestured to Zaphod to follow him. 
Out in the entrance chamber again, they could hear the screams of the passengers being fed coffee and biscuits. 
"It has not been a pleasant experience waiting for you," said Zarniwoop. 
"Not pleasant for you!" bawled Zaphod, "How do you think..." 
Zarniwoop held up a silencing finger as the hatchway swung open. A few feet away from them they could see Zaphod's jacket lying in the debris. 
"A very remarkable and very powerful ship," said Zarniwoop, "watch." 
As they watched, the pocket on the jacket suddenly bulged. It split, it ripped. The small metal model of the Heart of Gold that Zaphod had been bewildered to discover in his pocket was growing. 
It grew, it continued to grow. It reached, after two minutes, its full size. 
"At an Improbability Level," said Zarniwoop, "of... oh I don't know, but something very large." 
Zaphod swayed.â¨"You mean I had it with me all the time?"â¨"Zarniwoop smiled. He lifted up his briefcase and opened it. 
He twisted a single switch inside it. 
"Goodbye artificial Universe," he said, "hello real one!" 
The scene before them shimmered briefly and reappeared exactly as before. 
"You see?" said Zarniwoop, "exactly the same." 
"You mean," repeated Zaphod tautly, "that I had it with me all the time?" 
"Oh yes," said Zarniwoop, "of course. That was the whole point." 
"That's it," said Zaphod, "you can count me out, from hereon in you can count me out. I've had all I want of this. You play your own games." 
"I'm afraid you cannot leave," said Zarniwoop, "you are entwined in the Improbability field. You cannot escape." 
He smiled the smile that Zaphod had wanted to hit and this time Zaphod hit it. 
Chapter 13 
Ford Prefect bounded up to the bridge of the Heart of Gold. 
"Trillian! Arthur!" he shouted, "it's working! The ship's reactivated!" 
Trillian and Arthur were asleep on the floor. 
"Come on you guys, we're going off, we're off," he said kicking them awake. 
"Hi there guys!" twittered the computer, "it's really great to be back with you again, I can tell you, and I just want to say that..." 
"Shut up," said Ford, "tell us where the hell we are." 
"Frogstar World B, and man it's a dump," said Zaphod running on to the bridge, "hi, guys, you must be so amazingly glad to see me you don't even find words to tell me what a cool frood I am." 
"What a what?" said Arthur blearily, picking himself up from the floor and not taking any of this in. 
"I know how you feel," said Zaphod, "I'm so great even I get tongue-tied talking to myself. Hey it's good to see you Trillian, Ford, Monkeyman. Hey, er, computer...?" 
"Hi there, Mr. Beeblebrox sir, sure is a great honor to..." 
"Shut up and get us out of here, fast fast fast." 
"Sure thing, fella, where do you want to go?" 
"Anywhere, doesn't matter," shouted Zaphod, "yes it does!" he said again, "we want to go to the nearest place to eat!" 
"Sure thing," said the computer happily and a massive explosion rocket the bridge. 
When Zarniwoop entered a minute or so later with a black eye, he regarded the four wisps of smoke with interest. 
Chapter 14 
Four inert bodies sank through spinning blackness. Consciousness had died, cold oblivion pulled the bodies down and down into the pit of unbeing. The roar of silence echoed dismally around them and they sank at last into a dark and bitter sea of heaving red that slowly engulfed them, seemingly for ever. 
After what seemed an eternity the sea receded and left them lying on a cold hard shore, the flotsam and jetsam of the stream of Life, the Universe, and Everything. 
Cold spasms shook them, lights danced sickeningly around them. The cold hard shore tipped and span and then stood still. It shone darkly it was a very highly polished cold hard shore. 
A green blur watched them disapprovingly. 
It coughed. 
"Good evening, madam, gentlemen," it said, "do you have a reservation?" 
Ford Prefect's consciousness snapped back like elastic, making his brain smart. He looked up woozily at the green blur. 
"Reservation?" he said weakly. 
"Yes, sir," said the green blur. 
"Do you need a reservation for the afterlife?" 
In so far as it is possible for a green blur to arch its eyebrows disdainfully, this is what the green blur now did. 
"Afterlife, sir?" it said. 
Arthur Dent was grappling with his consciousness the way one grapples with a lost bar of soap in the bath. 
"Is this the afterlife?" he stammered. 
"Well I assume so," said Ford Prefect trying to work out which way was up. He tested the theory that it must lie in the opposite direction from the cold hard shore on which he was lying, and staggered to what he hoped were his feet. 
"I mean," he said, swaying gently, "there's no way we could have survived that blast is there?" 
"No," muttered Arthur. He had raised himself on to his elbows but it didn't seem to improve things. He slumped down again. 
"No," said Trillian, standing up, "no way at all." 
A dull hoarse gurgling sound came from the floor. It was Zaphod Beeblebrox attempting to speak. "I certainly didn't survive," he gurgled, "I was a total goner. Wham bang and that was it." 
"Yeah, thanks to you," said Ford, "We didn't stand a chance. We must have been blown to bits. Arms, legs everywhere." 
"Yeah," said Zaphod struggling noisily to his feet. 
"If the lady and gentlemen would like to order drinks..." said the green blur, hovering impatiently beside them. 
"Kerpow, splat," continued Zaphod, "instantaneously zonked into our component molecules. Hey, Ford," he said, identifying one of the slowly solidifying blurs around him, "did you get that thing of your whole life flashing before you?" 
"You got that too?" said Ford, "your whole life?" 
"Yeah," said Zaphod, "at least I assume it was mine. I spent a lot of time out of my skulls you know." 
He looked at around him at the various shapes that were at last becoming proper shapes instead of vague and wobbling shapeless shapes. 
"So..." he said.â¨"So what?" said Ford.â¨"So here we are," said Zaphod hesitantly, "lying dead..." "Standing," Trillian corrected him.â¨"Er, standing dead," continued Zaphod, "in this desolate..." 
"Restaurant," said Arthur Dent who had got to his feet and could now, much to his surprise, see clearly. That is to say, the thing that surprised him was not that he could see, but what he could see. 
"Here we are," continued Zaphod doggedly, "standing dead in this desolate..." 
"Five star..." said Trillian. "Restaurant," concluded Zaphod. "Odd isn't it?" said Ford. 
"Er, yeah." 
"Nice chandeliers though," said Trillian. 
They looked about themselves in bemusement. 
"It's not so much an afterlife," said Arthur, "more a sort of aprÃ¨s vie." 
The chandeliers were in fact a little on the flashy side and the low vaulted ceiling from which they hung would not, in an ideal Universe, have been painted in that particular shade of deep turquoise, and even if it had been it wouldn't have been highlighted by concealed moodlighting. This is not, however, an ideal Universe, as was further evidenced by the eye-crossing patterns of the inlaid marble floor, and the way in which the fronting for the eighty-yard long marble-topped bar had been made. The fronting for the eighty-yard long marble- topped bar had been made by stitching together nearly twenty thousand Antarean Mosaic Lizard skins, despite the fact that the twenty thousand lizards concerned had needed them to keep their insides in. 
A few smartly dressed creatures were lounging casually at the bar or relaxing in the richly coloured body-hugging seats that were deployed here and there about the bar area. A young Vl'Hurg officer and his green steaming young lady passed through the large smoked glass doors at the far end of the bar into the dazzling light of the main body of the Restaurant beyond. 
Behind Arthur was a large curtained bay window. He pulled aside the corner of the curtain and looked out at a landscape which under normal circumstances would have given Arthur the creeping horrors. These were not, however, normal circumstances, for the thing that froze his blood and made his skin try to crawl up his back and off the top of his head was the sky. The sky was... 
An attendant flunkey politely drew the curtain back into place. "All in good time, sir," he said.â¨Zaphod's eyes flashed. 
"Hey, hang about you dead guys," he said, "I think we're missing some ultra-important thing here you know. Something somebody said and we missed it." 
Arthur was profoundly relieved to turn his attention from what he had just seen. 
He said, "I said it was a sort of aprÃ¨s..."â¨"Yeah, and don't you wish you hadn't?" said Zaphod, "Ford?" "I said it was odd."â¨"Yeah, shrewd but dull, perhaps it was..." 
"Perhaps," interrupted the green blur who had by this time resolved into the shape of a small wizened dark-suited green waiter, "perhaps you would care to discuss the matter over drinks..." 
"Drinks!" cried Zaphod, "that was it! See what you miss if you don't stay alert." 
"Indeed sir," said the waiter patiently. "If the lady and gentlemen would care to order drinks before dinner..." 
"Dinner!" Zaphod exclaimed with passion, "Listen, little green person, my stomach could take you home and cuddle you all night for the mere idea." 
"... and the Universe," concluded the waiter, determined not to be deflected on his home stretch, "will explode later for your pleasure." 
Ford's head swivelled towards him. He spoke with feeling. 
"Wow," he said, "What sort of drinks do you serve in this place?" 
The waiter laughed a polite little waiter's laugh. 
"Ah," he said, "I think sir has perhaps misunderstood me." 
"Oh, I hope not," breathed Ford. 
The waiter coughed a polite little waiter's cough. 
"It is not unusual for our customers to be a little disoriented by the time journey," he said, "so if I might suggest..." 
"Time journey?" said Zaphod.â¨"Time journey?" said Ford.â¨"Time journey?" said Trillian.â¨"You mean this isn't the afterlife?" said Arthur. 
The waiter smiled a polite little waiter's smile. He had almost exhausted his polite little waiter repertoire and would soon be slipping into his role of a rather tight lipped and sarcastic little waiter. 
"Afterlife sir?" he said, "No sir." "And we're not dead?" said Arthur. The waiter tightened his lips. 
"Aha, ha," he said, "Sir is most evidently alive, otherwise I would not attempt to serve sir." 
In an extraordinary gesture which is pointless attempting to describe, Zaphod Beeblebrox slapped both his foreheads with two of his arms and one of his thighs with the other. 
"Hey guys," he said, "This is crazy. We finally did it. We finally got to where we were going. This is Milliways!" 
"Yes sir," said the waiter, laying on the patience with a trowel, "this is Milliways the Restaurant at the End of the Universe." 
"End of what?" said Arthur. 
"The Universe," repeated the waiter, very clearly and unnecessarily distinctly. 
"When did that end?" said Arthur. 
"In just a few minutes, sir," said the waiter. He took a deep breath. He didn't need to do this since his body was supplied with the peculiar assortment of gases it required for survival from a small intravenous device strapped to his leg. There are times, however, when whatever your metabolism you have to take a deep breath. 
"Now, if you would care to order drinks at last," he said, "I will then show you to your table." 
Zaphod grinned two manic grins, sauntered over to the bar and bought most of it. 
Chapter 15 
The Restaurant at the End of the Universe is one of the most extraordinary ventures in the entire history of catering. It has been built on the fragmented remains of... it will be built on the fragmented... that is to say it will have been built by this time, and indeed has been 
One of the major problems encountered in time travel is not that of accidentally becoming your own father or mother. There is no problem involved in becoming your own father or mother that a broadminded and well-adjusted family can't cope with. There is also no problem about changing the course of history the course of history does not change because it all fits together like a jigsaw. All the important changes have happened before the things they were supposed to change and it all sorts itself out in the end. 
The major problem is quite simply one of grammar, and the main work to consult in this matter is Dr. Dan Streetmentioner's Time Traveller's Handbook of 1001 Tense Formations. It will tell you for instance how to describe something that was about to happen to you in the past before you avoided it by time jumping forward two days in order to avoid it. The event will be described differently according to whether you are talking about it from the standpoint of your own natural time, from a time in the further future, or a time in the further past and is further complicated by the possibility of conducting conversations whilst you are actually travelling from one time to another with the intention of becoming your own father or mother. 
Most readers get as far as the Future Semi-Conditionally Modified Subinverted Plagal Past Subjunctive Intentional before giving up: and in fact in later editions of the book all the pages beyond this point have been left blank to save on printing costs. 
The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy skips lightly over this tangle of academic abstraction, pausing only to note that the term "Future Perfect" has been abandoned since it was discovered not to be. 
To resume: 
The Restaurant at the End of the Universe is one of the most extraordinary ventures in the entire history of catering. 
It is built on the fragmented remains of an eventually ruined planet which is (wioll haven be) enclosed in a vast time bubble and projected forward in time to the precise moment of the End of the Universe. 
This is, many would say, impossible. 
In it, guests take (willan on-take) their places at table and eat (willan on-eat) sumptuous meals whilst watching (willing watchen) the whole of creation explode around them. 
This is, many would say, equally impossible. 
You can arrive (mayan arivan on-when) for any sitting you like without prior (late fore-when) reservation because you can book retrospectively, as it were when you return to your own time. (you can have on-book haventa forewhen presooning returningwenta retrohome.) 
This is, many would now insist, absolutely impossible. 
At the Restaurant you can meet and dine with (mayan meetan con with dinan on when) a fascinating cross-section of the entire population of space and time. 
This, it can be explained patiently, is also impossible. 
You can visit it as many times as you like (mayan on-visit re- onvisiting... and so on-for further tense-corrections consult Dr. Streetmentioner's book) and be sure of never meeting yourself, because of the embarrassment this usually causes. 
This, even if the rest were true, which it isn't, is patently impossible, say the doubters. 
All you have to do is deposit one penny in a savings account in your own era, and when you arrive at the End of Time the operation of compound interest means that the fabulous cost of your meal has been paid for. 
This, many claim, is not merely impossible but clearly insane, which is why the advertising executives of the star system of Bastablon came up with this slogan: "If you've done six impossible things this morning, why not round it off with breakfast at Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe?" 
Chapter 16 
At the bar, Zaphod was rapidly becoming as tired as a newt. His heads knocked together and his smiles were coming out of synch. He was miserably happy. 
"Zaphod," said Ford, "whilst you're still capable of speech, would you care to tell me what the photon happened? Where have you been? Where have we been? Small matter, but I'd like it cleared up." 
Zaphod's left head sobered up, leaving his right to sink further into the obscurity of drink. 
"Yeah," he said, "I've been around. They want me to find the man who rules the Universe, but I don't care to meet him. I believe the man can't cook." 
His left head watched his right head saying this and then nodded. 
"True," it said, "have another drink." 
Ford had another Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, the drink which has been described as the alcoholic equivalent of a mugging-expensive and bad for the head. Whatever had happened, Ford decided, he didn't really care too much. 
"Listen Ford," said Zaphod, "everything's cool and froody." 
"You mean everything's under control." 
"No," said Zaphod, "I do not mean everything's under control. That would not be cool and froody. If you want to know what happened let's just say I had the whole situation in my pocket. OK?" 
Ford shrugged. 
Zaphod giggled into his drink. It frothed up over the side of the glass and started to eat its way into the marble bar top. 
A wild-skinned sky-gypsy approached them and played electric violin at them until Zaphod gave him a lot of money and he agreed to go away again. 
The gypsy approached Arthur and Trillian sitting in another part of the bar. 
"I don't know what this place is," said Arthur, "but I think it gives me the creeps." 
"Have another drink," said Trillian, "Enjoy yourself." 
"Which?" said Arthur, "the two are mutually exclusive." 
"Poor Arthur, you're not really cut out for this life are you?" 
"You call this life?" 
"You're beginning to sound like Marvin." 
"Marvin's the clearest thinker I know. How do you think we make this violinist go away?" 
The waiter approached. 
"Your table is ready," he said. 
Seen from the outside, which it never is, the Restaurant resembles a giant glittering starfish beached on a forgotten rock. Each of its arms houses the bars, the kitchens, the forcefield generators which protect the entire structure and the decayed planet on which it sits, and the Time Turbines which slowly rock the whole affair backwards and forwards across the crucial moment. 
In the centre sits the gigantic golden dome, almost a complete globe, and it was into this area that Zaphod, Ford, Arthur and Trillian now passed. 
At least five tons of glitter alone had gone into it before them, and covered every available surface. The other surfaces were not available because they were already encrusted with jewels, precious sea shells from Santraginus, gold leaf, mosaic tiles, lizard skins and a million unidentifiable embellishments and decorations. Glass glittered, silver shone, gold gleamed, Arthur Dent goggled. 
"Wowee," said Zaphod, "Zappo."â¨"Incredible!" breathed Arthur, "the people...! The things...!" "The things," said Ford Prefect quietly, "are also people." "The people..." resumed Arthur, "the... other people..." "The lights...!" said Trillian.â¨"The tables..." said Arthur.â¨"The clothes...!" said Trillian.â¨The waiter thought they sounded like a couple of bailiffs. 
"The End of the Universe is very popular," said Zaphod threading his way unsteadily through the throng of tables, some made of 
marble, some of rich ultra-mahagony, some even of platinum, and at each a party of exotic creatures chatting amongst themselves and studying menus. 
"People like to dress up for it," continued Zaphod, "Gives it a sense of occasion." 
The tables were fanned out in a large circle around a central stage area where a small band were playing light music, at least a thousand tables was Arthur's guess, and interspersed amongst them were swaying palms, hissing fountains, grotesque statuary, in short all the paraphernalia common to all Restaurants where little expense has been spared to give the impression that no expense has been spared. Arthur glanced around, half expecting to see someone making an American Express commercial. 
Zaphod lurched into Ford, who lurched back into Zaphod. "Wowee," said Zaphod.â¨"Zappo," said Ford. 
"My great granddaddy must have really screwed up the computer's works, you know," said Zaphod, "I told it to take us to the nearest place to eat and it sends us to the End of the Universe. Remind me to be nice to it one day." 
He paused.â¨"Hey, everybody's here you know. Everybody who was anybody." "Was?" said Arthur. 
"At the End of the Universe you have to use the past tense a lot," said Zaphod, "'cos everything's been done you know. Hi, guys," he called out to a nearby party of giant iguana lifeforms, "How did you do?" 
"Is that Zaphod Beeblebrox?" asked one iguana of another iguana. "I think so," replied the second iguana.â¨"Well doesn't that just take the biscuit," said the first iguana. "Funny old thing, life," said the second iguana. 
"It's what you make of it," said the first and they lapsed back into silence. They were waiting for the greatest show in the Universe. 
"Hey, Zaphod," said Ford, grabbing for his arm and, on account of the third Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, missing. He pointed a swaying finger. 
"There's an old mate of mine," he said, "Hotblack Desiato! See the man at the platinum table with the platinum suit on?" 
Zaphod tried to follow Ford's finger with his eyes but it made him feel dizzy. Finally he saw. 
"Oh yeah," he said, then recognition came a moment later. "Hey," he said, "did that guy ever make it megabig! Wow, bigger than the biggest thing ever. Other than me." 
"Who's he supposed to be?" asked Trillian. 
"Hotblack Desiato?" said Zaphod in astonishment, "you don't know? You never heard of Disaster Area?" 
"No," said Trillian, who hadn't. 
"The biggest," said Ford, "loudest..." 
"Richest..." suggested Zaphod. 
"... rock band in the history of..." he searched for the word. 
"... history itself," said Zaphod. 
"No," said Trillian. 
"Zowee," said Zaphod, "here we are at the End of the Universe and you haven't even lived yet. Did you miss out." 
He led her off to where the waiter had been waiting all this time at the table. Arthur followed them feeling very lost and alone. 
Ford waded off through the throng to renew an old acquaintance. 
"Hey, er, Hotblack," he called out, "how you doing? Great to see you big boy, how's the noise? You're looking great, really very, very fat and unwell. Amazing." He slapped the man on the back and was mildly surprised that it seemed to elict no response. The Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters swirling round inside him told him to plunge on regardless. 
"Remember the old days?" he said, "We used to hang out, right? The Bistro Illegal, remember? Slim's Throat Emporium? The Evildrome Boozarama, great days eh?" 
Hotblack Desiato offered no opinion as to whether they were great days or not. Ford was not perturbed. 
"And when we were hungry we'd pose as public health inspectors, you remember that? And go around confiscating meals and drinks right? Till we got food poisoning. Oh, and then there were the long nights of talking and drinking in those smelly rooms above the Cafe 
Lou in Gretchen Town, New Betel, and you were always in the next room trying to write songs on your ajuitar and we all hated them. And you said you didn't care, and we said we did because we hated them so much." Ford's eyes were beginning to mist over. 
"And you said you didn't want to be a star," he continued, wallowing in nostalgia, "because you despised the star system. And we said, Hadra and Sulijoo and me, that we didn't think you had the option. And what do you do now? You buy star systems!" 
He turned and solicited the attention of those at nearby tables. 
"Here," he said, "is a man who buys star systems!" 
Hotblack Desiato made no attempt either to confirm or deny this fact, and the attention of the temporary audience waned rapidly. 
"I think someone's drunk," muttered a purple bush-like being into his wine glass. 
Ford staggered slightly, and sat down heavily on the chair facing Hotblack Desiato. 
"What's that number you do?" he said, unwisely grabbing at a bottle for support and tipping it over into a nearby glass as it happened. Not to waste a happy accident, he drained the glass. 
"That really huge number," he continued, "how does it go? 'Bwarm! Bwarm! Baderr!!' something, and in the stage act you do it ends up with this ship crashing right into the sun, and you actually do it!" 
Ford crashed his fist into his other hand to illustrate this feat graphically. He knocked the bottle over again. 
"Ship! Sun! Wham bang!" he cried. "I mean forget lasers and stuff, you guys are into solar flares and real sunburn! Oh, and terrible songs." 
His eyes followed the stream of liquid glugging out of the bottle on to the table. Something ought to be done about it, he thought. 
"Hey, you want a drink?" he said. It began to sink into his squelching mind that something was missing from this reunion, and that the missing something was in some way connected with the fact that the fat man sitting opposite him in the platinum suit and the silvery trilby had not yet said "Hi, Ford" or "Great to see you after all this time," or in fact anything at all. More to the point he had not yet even moved. 
"Hotblack?" said Ford. 
A large meaty hand landed on his shoulder from behind and pushed him aside. He slid gracelessly off his seat and peered upwards to see if he could spot the owner of this discourteous hand. The owner was not hard to spot, on account of his being something of the order of seven feet tall and not slightly built with it. In fact he was built the way one builds leather sofas, shiny, lumpy and with lots of solid stuffing. The suit into which the man's body had been stuffed looked as if it's only purpose in life was to demonstrate how difficult it was to get this sort of body into a suit. The face had the texture of an orange and the colour of an apple, but there the resemblance to anything sweet ended. 
"Kid..." said a voice which emerged from the man's mouth as if it had been having a really rough time down in his chest. 
"Er, yeah?" said Ford conversationally. He staggered back to his feet again and was disappointed that the top of his head didn't come further up the man's body. 
"Beat it," said the man. 
"Oh yeah?" said Ford, wondering how wise he was being, "and who are you?" 
The man considered this for a moment. He wasn't used to being asked this sort of question. Nevertheless, after a while he came up with an answer. 
"I'm the guy who's telling you to beat it," he said, "before you get it beaten for you." 
"Now listen," said Ford nervously he wished his head would stop spinning, settle down and get to grips with the situation "Now listen," he continued, "I am one of Hotblack's oldest friends and..." 
He glanced at Hotblack Desiato, who still hadn't moved so much as an eyelash. 
"... and..." said Ford again, wondering what would be a good word to say after "and". 
The large man came up with a whole sentence to go after "and". He said it. 
"And I am Mr. Desiato's bodyguard," it went, "and I am responsible for his body, and I am not responsible for yours, so take it away before it gets damaged." 
"Now wait a minute," said Ford. 
"No minutes!" boomed the bodyguard, "no waiting! Mr. Desiato speaks to no one!" 
"Well perhaps you'd let him say what he thinks about the matter himself," said Ford. 
"He speaks to no one!" bellowed the bodyguard. 
Ford glanced anxiously at Hotblack again and was forced to admit to himself that the bodyguard seemed to have the facts on his side. There was still not the slightest sign of movement, let alone keen interest in Ford's welfare. 
"Why?" said Ford, "What's the matter with him?" The bodyguard told him. 
Chapter 17 
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy notes that Disaster Area, a plutonium rock band from the Gagrakacka Mind Zones, are generally held to be not only the loudest rock band in the Galaxy, but in fact the loudest noise of any kind at all. Regular concert goers judge that the best sound balance is usually to be heard from within large concrete bunkers some thirty-seven miles from the stage, whilst the musicians themselves play their instruments by remote control from within a heavily insulated spaceship which stays in orbit around the planet or more frequently around a completely different planet. 
Their songs are on the whole very simple and mostly follow the familiar theme of boy-being meets girl-being beneath a silvery moon, which then explodes for no adequately explored reason. 
Many worlds have now banned their act altogether, sometimes for artistic reasons, but most commonly because the band's public address system contravenes local strategic arms limitations treaties. 
This has not, however, stopped their earnings from pushing back the boundaries of pure hypermathematics, and their chief research accountant has recently been appointed Professor ofâ¨Neomathematics at the University of Maximegalon, in recognition of both his General and his Special Theories of Disaster Area Tax Returns, in which he proves that the whole fabric of the space-time continuum is not merely curved, it is in fact totally bent. 
Ford staggered back to the table where Zaphod, Arthur and Trillian were sitting waiting for the fun to begin. 
"Gotta have some food," said Ford.â¨"Hi, Ford," said Zaphod, "you speak to the big noise boy?" Ford waggled his head noncommittally.â¨"Hotblack? I sort of spoke to him, yeah."â¨"What'd he say?" 
"Well, not a lot really. He's... er..." 
"Yeah?" 
"He's spending a year dead for tax reasons. I've got to sit down." 
He sat down. 
The waiter approached. 
"Would you like to see the menu?" he said, "or would you like to meet the Dish of the Day?" 
"Huh?" said Ford.â¨"Huh?" said Arthur.â¨"Huh?" said Trillian.â¨"That's cool," said Zaphod, "we'll meet the meat." 
In a small room in one of the arms of the Restaurant complex a tall, thin, gangling figure pulled aside a curtain and oblivion looked him in the face. 
It was not a pretty face, perhaps because oblivion had looked him in it so many times. It was too long for a start, the eyes too sunken and too hooded, the cheeks too hollow, his lips were too thin and too long, and when they parted his teeth looked too much like a recently polished bay window. The hands that held the curtain were long and thin too: they were also cold. They lay lightly along the folds of the curtain and gave the impression that if he didn't watch them like a hawk they would crawl away of their own accord and do something unspeakable in a corner. 
He let the curtain drop and the terrible light that had played on his features went off to play somewhere more healthy. He prowled around his small chamber like a mantis contemplating an evening's preying, finally settling on a rickety chair by a trestle table, where he leafed through a few sheets of jokes. 
A bell rang. 
He pushed the thin sheaf of papers aside and stood up. His hands brushed limply over some of the one million rainbow-coloured sequins with which his jacket was festooned, and he was gone through the door. 
In the Restaurant the lights dimmed, the band quickened its pace, a single spotlight stabbed down into the darkness of the stairway that led up to the centre of the stage. 
Up the stairs bounded a tall brilliantly coloured figure. He burst on to the stage, tripped lightly up to the microphone, removed it from its stand with one swoop of his long thin hand and stood for a moment bowing left and right to the audience acknowledging their applause and displaying to them his bay window. He waved to his particular friends in the audience even though there weren't any there, and waited for the applause to die down. 
He held up his hand and smiled a smile that stretched not merely from ear to ear, but seemed to extend some way beyond the mere confines of his face. 
"Thank you ladies and gentlemen!" he cried, "thank you very much. Thank you so much." 
He eyed them with a twinkling eye. 
"Ladies and gentlemen," he said, "The Universe as we know it has now been in existence for over one hundred and seventy thousand million billion years and will be ending in a little over half an hour. So, welcome one and all to Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe!" 
With a gesture he deftly conjured another round of spontaneous applause. With another gesture he cut it. 
"I am your host for tonight," he said, "my name is Max Quordlepleen..." (Everybody knew this, his act was famous throughout the known Galaxy, but he said it for the fresh applause it generated, which he acknowledged with a disclaiming smile and wave.) "... and I've just come straight from the very very other end of time, where I've been hosting a show at the Big Bang Burger Bar where I can tell you we had a very exciting evening ladies and gentlemen and I will be with you right through this historic occasion, the End of History itself!" 
Another burst of applause died away quickly as the lights dimmed down further. On every table candles ignited themselves spontaneously, eliciting a slight gasp from all the diners and wreathing them in a thousand tiny flickering lights and a million intimate shadows. A tremor of excitement thrilled through the 
darkened Restaurant as the vast golden dome above them began very very slowly to dim, to darken, to fade. 
Max's voice was hushed as he continued. 
"So, ladies and gentlemen," he breathed, "the candles are lit, the band plays softly, and as the force-shielded dome above us fades into transparency, revealing a dark and sullen sky hung heavy with the ancient light of livid swollen stars, I can see we're all in for a fabulous evening's apocalypse!" 
Even the soft tootling of the band faded away as stunned shock descended on all those who had not seen this sight before. 
A monstrous, grisly light poured in on them, a hideous light,â¨a boiling, pestilential light,â¨a light that would have disfigured hell. 
The Universe was coming to an end. 
For a few interminable seconds the Restaurant span silently through the raging void. Then Max spoke again. 
"For those of you who ever hoped to see the light at the end of the tunnel," he said, "this is it." 
The band struck up again. 
"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen," cried Max, "I'll be back with you again in just a moment, and meanwhile I leave you in the very capable hands of Mr. Reg Nullify and his cataclysmic Combo. Big hand please ladies and gentlemen for Reg and the boys!" 
The baleful turmoil of the skies continued. 
Hesitantly the audience began to clap and after a moment or so normal conversation resumed. Max began his round of the tables, swapping jokes, shouting with laughter, earning his living. 
A large dairy animal approached Zaphod Beeblebrox's table, a large fat meaty quadruped of the bovine type with large watery eyes, small horns and what might almost have been an ingratiating smile on its lips. 
"Good evening," it lowed and sat back heavily on its haunches, "I am the main Dish of the Day. May I interest you in parts of my body?" It harrumphed and gurgled a bit, wriggled its hind quarters into a more comfortable position and gazed peacefully at them. 
Its gaze was met by looks of startled bewilderment from Arthur and Trillian, a resigned shrug from Ford Prefect and naked hunger from Zaphod Beeblebrox. 
"Something off the shoulder perhaps?" suggested the animal, "Braised in a white wine sauce?" 
"Er, your shoulder?" said Arthur in a horrified whisper. 
"But naturally my shoulder, sir," mooed the animal contentedly, "nobody else's is mine to offer." 
Zaphod leapt to his feet and started prodding and feeling the animal's shoulder appreciatively. 
"Or the rump is very good," murmured the animal. "I've been exercising it and eating plenty of grain, so there's a lot of good meat there." It gave a mellow grunt, gurgled again and started to chew the cud. It swallowed the cud again. 
"Or a casserole of me perhaps?" it added. 
"You mean this animal actually wants us to eat it?" whispered Trillian to Ford. 
"Me?" said Ford, with a glazed look in his eyes, "I don't mean anything." 
"That's absolutely horrible," exclaimed Arthur, "the most revolting thing I've ever heard." 
"What's the problem Earthman?" said Zaphod, now transferring his attention to the animal's enormous rump. 
"I just don't want to eat an animal that's standing here inviting me to," said Arthur, "it's heartless." 
"Better than eating an animal that doesn't want to be eaten," said Zaphod. 
"That's not the point," Arthur protested. Then he thought about it for a moment. "Alright," he said, "maybe it is the point. I don't care, I'm not going to think about it now. I'll just... er..." 
The Universe raged about him in its death throes. 
"I think I'll just have a green salad," he muttered. 
"May I urge you to consider my liver?" asked the animal, "it must be very rich and tender by now, I've been force-feeding myself for months." 
"A green salad," said Arthur emphatically. 
"A green salad?" said the animal, rolling his eyes disapprovingly at Arthur. 
"Are you going to tell me," said Arthur, "that I shouldn't have green salad?" 
"Well," said the animal, "I know many vegetables that are veryâ¨clear on that point. Which is why it was eventually decided to cut through the whole tangled problem and breed an animal that actually wanted to be eaten and was capable of saying so clearly and distinctly. And here I am." 
It managed a very slight bow. 
"Glass of water please," said Arthur. 
"Look," said Zaphod, "we want to eat, we don't want to make a meal of the issues. Four rare steaks please, and hurry. We haven't eaten in five hundred and seventy-six thousand million years." 
The animal staggered to its feet. It gave a mellow gurgle. 
"A very wise choice, sir, if I may say so. Very good," it said, "I'll just nip off and shoot myself." 
He turned and gave a friendly wink to Arthur. "Don't worry, sir," he said, "I'll be very humane." It waddled unhurriedly off into the kitchen. 
A matter of minutes later the waiter arrived with four huge steaming steaks. Zaphod and Ford wolfed straight into them without a second's hesitation. Trillian paused, then shrugged and started into hers. 
Arthur stared at his feeling slightly ill. 
"Hey, Earthman," said Zaphod with a malicious grin on the face that wasn't stuffing itself, "what's eating you?" 
And the band played on. 
All around the Restaurant people and things relaxed and chatted. The air was filled with talk of this and that, and with the mingled scents of exotic plants, extravagant foods and insidious wines. For an infinite number of miles in every direction the universal cataclysm was gathering to a stupefying climax. Glancing at his watch, Max returned to the stage with a flourish. 
"And now, ladies and gentlemen," he beamed, "is everyone having one last wonderful time?" 
"Yes," called out the sort of people who call out "yes" when comedians ask them if they're having a wonderful time. 
"That's wonderful," enthused Max, "absolutely wonderful. And as the photon storms gather in swirling crowds around us, preparing to tear apart the last of the red hot suns, I know you're all going to settle back and enjoy with me what I know we will find all an immensely exciting and terminal experience." 
He paused. He caught the audience with a glittering eye. 
"Believe me, ladies and gentlemen," he said, "there's nothing penultimate about this one." 
He paused again. Tonight his timing was immaculate. Time after time he had done this show, night after night. Not that the word night had any meaning here at the extremity of time. All there was the endless repetition of the final moment, as the Restaurant rocked slowly forward over the brink of time's furthest edge and back again. This "night" was good though, the audience was writhing in the palm of his sickly hand. His voice dropped. They had to strain to hear him. 
"This," he said, "really is the absolute end, the final chilling desolation, in which the whole majestic sweep of creation becomes extinct. This ladies and gentlemen is the proverbial 'it'." 
He dropped his voice still lower. In the stillness, a fly would not have dared clear its throat. 
"After this," he said, "there is nothing. Void. Emptiness. Oblivion. Absolute nothing..." 
His eyes glittered again or did they twinkle?" 
"Nothing... except of course for the sweet trolley, and a fine selection of Aldebaran liqueurs!" 
The band gave him a musical sting. He wished they wouldn't, he didn't need it, not an artist of his calibre. He could play the audience like his own musical instrument. They were laughing with relief. He followed on. 
"And for once," he cried cheerily, "you don't need to worry about having a hangover in the morning because there won't be any more mornings!" 
He beamed at his happy, laughing audience. He glanced up at the sky, going through the same dead routine every night, but his glance 
was only for a fraction of a second. He trusted it to do its job, as one professional trusts another. 
"And now," he said, strutting about the stage, "at the risk of putting a damper on the wonderful sense of doom and futility here this evening, I would like to welcome a few parties." 
He pulled a card from his pocket. 
"Do we have..." he put up a hand to hold back the cheers, "Do we have a party here from the Zansellquasure Flamarion Bridge Club from beyond the Vortvoid of Qvarne? Are they here?" 
A rousing cheer came from the back, but he pretended not to hear. He peered around trying to find them. 
"Are they here?" he asked again, to elict a louder cheer. 
He got it, as he always did. 
"Ah, there they are. Well, last bids lads and no cheating, remember this is a very solemn moment." 
He lapped up the laughter. 
"And do we also have, do we have... a party of minor deities from the Halls of Asgard?" 
Away to his right came a rumble of thunder. Lightning arced across the stage. A small group of hairy men with helmets sat looking very pleased with themselves, and raised their glasses to him. 
Hasbeens, he thought to himself. 
"Careful with that hammer, sir," he said. 
They did their trick with the lightning again. Max gave them a very thin lipped smile. 
"And thirdly," he said, "thirdly a party of Young Conservatives from Sirius B, are they here?" 
A party of smartly dressed young dogs stopped throwing rolls at each other and started throwing rolls at the stage. They yapped and barked unintelligibly. 
"Yes," said Max, "well this is all your fault, you realize that?" 
"And finally," said Max, quieting the audience down and putting on his solemn face, "finally I believe we have with us here tonight, a party of believers, very devout believers, from the Church of the Second Coming of the Great Prophet Zarquon." 
There were about twenty of them, sitting right out on the edge of the floor, ascetically dressed, sipping mineral water nervously, and staying apart from the festivities. They blinked resentfully as the spotlight was turned on them. 
"There they are," said Max, "sitting there, patiently. He said he'd come again, and he's kept you waiting a long time, so let's hope he's hurrying fellas, because he's only got eight minutes left!" 
The party of Zarquon's followers sat rigid, refusing to be buffeted by the waves of uncharitable laughter which swept over them. 
Max restrained his audience. 
"No, but seriously though folks, seriously though, no offence meant. No, I know we shouldn't make fun of deeply held beliefs, so I think a big hand please for the Great Prophet Zarquon..." 
The audience clapped respectfully. 
"... wherever he's got to!" 
He blew a kiss to the stony-faced party and returned to the centre of the stage. 
He grabbed a tall stool and sat on it. 
"It's marvellous though," he rattled on, "to see so many of you here tonight no isn't it though? Yes, absolutely marvellous. Because I know that so many of you come here time and time again, which I think is really wonderful, to come and watch this final end of everything, and then return home to your own eras... and raise families, strive for new and better societies, fight terrible wars for what you know to be right... it really gives one hope for the future of all lifekind. Except of course," he waved at the blitzing turmoil above and around them, "that we know it hasn't got one..." 
Arthur turned to Ford he hadn't quite got this place worked out in his mind. 
"Look, surely," he said, "if the Universe is about to end... don't we go with it?" 
Ford gave him a three-Pan-Galactic-Gargle-Blaster look, in other words a rather unsteady one. 
"No," he said, "look," he said, "as soon as you come into this dive you get held in this sort of amazing force-shielded temporal warp thing. I think." 
"Oh," said Arthur. He turned his attention back to a bowl of soup he'd managed to get from the waiter to replace his steak. 
"Look," said Ford, "I'll show you." 
He grabbed at a napkin off the table and fumbled hopelessly with it. 
"Look," he said again, "imagine this napkin, right, as the temporal Universe, right? And this spoon as a transductional mode in the matter curve..." 
It took him a while to say this last part, and Arthur hated to interrupt him. 
"That's the spoon I was eating with," he said. 
"Alright," said Ford, "imagine this spoon..." he found a small wooden spoon on a tray of relishes, "this spoon..." but found it rather tricky to pick up, "no, better still this fork..." 
"Hey would you let go of my fork?" snapped Zaphod. 
"Alright," said Ford, "alright, alright. Why don't we say... why don't we say that this wine glass is the temporal Universe..." 
"What, the one you've just knocked on the floor?" 
"Did I do that?" 
"Yes." 
"Alright," said Ford, "forget that. I mean... I mean, look, do you know do you know how the Universe actually began for a kick off?" 
"Probably not," said Arthur, who wished he'd never embarked on any of this. 
"Alright," said Ford, "imagine this. Right. You get this bath. Right. A large round bath. And it's made of ebony." 
"Where from?" said Arthur, "Harrods was destroyed by the Vogons." 
"Doesn't matter." 
"So you keep saying." 
"Listen." 
"Alright." 
"You get this bath, see? Imagine you've got this bath. And it's ebony. And it's conical." 
"Conical?" said Arthur, "What sort of..." 
"Shhh!" said Ford. "It's conical. So what you do is, you see, you fill it with fine white sand, alright? Or sugar. Fine white sand, and/or sugar. Anything. Doesn't matter. Sugar's fine. And when it's full, you pull the plug out... are you listening?" 
"I'm listening." 
"You pull the plug out, and it all just twirls away, twirls away you see, out of the plughole." 
"I see." 
"You don't see. You don't see at all. I haven't got to the clever bit yet. You want to hear the clever bit?" 
"Tell me the clever bit." 
"I'll tell you the clever bit." 
Ford thought for a moment, trying to remember what the clever bit was. 
"The clever bit," he said, "is this. You film it happening." 
"Clever." 
"That's not the clever bit. This is the clever bit, I remember now that this is the clever bit. The clever bit is that you then thread the film in the projector... backwards!" 
"Backwards?" 
"Yes. Threading it backwards is definitely the clever bit. So then, you just sit and watch it, and everything just appears to spiral upwards out of the plughole and fill the bath. See?" 
"And that's how the Universe began is it?" said Arthur. "No," said Ford, "but it's a marvellous way to relax." He reached for his wine glass.â¨"Where's my wine glass?" he said. 
"It's on the floor." 
"Ah." 
Tipping back his chair to look for it, Ford collided with the small green waiter who was approaching the table carrying a portable telephone. 
Ford excused himself to the waiter explaining that it was because he was extremely drunk. 
The waiter said that that was quite alright and that he perfectly understood. 
Ford thanked the waiter for his kind indulgence, attempted to tug his forelock, missed by six inches and slid under the table. 
"Mr. Zaphod Beeblebrox?" inquired the waiter. 
"Er, yeah?" said Zaphod, glancing up from his third steak. 
"There is a phone call for you." 
"Hey, what?" 
"A phone call, sir." 
"For me? Here? Hey, but who knows where I am?" 
One of his minds raced. The other dawdled lovingly over the food it was still shovelling in. 
"Excuse me if I carry on, won't you?" said his eating head and carried on. 
There were now so many people after him he'd lost count. He shouldn't have made such a conspicuous entrance. Hell, why not though, he thought. How do you know you're having fun if there's no one watching you have it? 
"Maybe someone here tipped off the Galactic Police," said Trillian. "Everyone saw you come in." 
"You mean they want to arrest me over the phone?" said Zaphod, "Could be. I'm a pretty dangerous dude when I'm concerned." 
"Yeah," said a voice from under the table, "you go to pieces so fast people get hit by the shrapnel." 
"Hey, what is this, Judgment Day?" snapped Zaphod. 
"Do we get to see that as well?" asked Arthur nervously. 
"I'm in no hurry," muttered Zaphod, "OK, so who's the cat on the phone?" He kicked Ford. "Hey get up there, kid," he said to him, "I may need you." 
"I am not," said the waiter, "personally acquainted with the metal gentlemen in question, sir..." 
"Metal?"â¨"Yes, sir."â¨"Did you say metal?" 
"Yes, sir. I said that I am not personally acquainted with the metal gentleman in question..." 
"OK, carry on." 
"But I am informed that he has been awaiting your return for a considerable number of millennia. It seems you left here somewhat precipitately." 
"Left here?" said Zaphod, "are you being strange? We only just arrived here." 
"Indeed, sir," persisted the waiter doggedly, "but before you arrived here, sir, I understand that you left here." 
Zaphod tried this in one brain, then in the other. 
"You're saying," he said, "that before we arrived here, we left here?" 
This is going to be a long night, thought the waiter. 
"Precisely, sir," he said. 
"Put your analyst on danger money, baby," advised Zaphod. 
"No, wait a minute," said Ford, emerging above table level again, "where exactly is here?" 
"To be absolutely exact sir, it is Frogstar World B." 
"But we just left there," protested Zaphod, "we left there and came to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe." 
"Yes, sir," said the waiter, feeling that he was now into the home stretch and running well, "the one was constructed on the ruins of the other." 
"Oh," said Arthur brightly, "you mean we've travelled in time but not in space." 
"Listen you semi-evolved simian," cut in Zaphod, "go climb a tree will you?" 
Arthur bristled. 
"Go bang your heads together four-eyes," he advised Zaphod. 
"No, no," the waiter said to Zaphod, "your monkey has got it right, sir." 
Arthur stuttered in fury and said nothing apposite, or indeed coherent. 
"You jumped forward... I believe five hundred and seventy-six thousand million years whilst staying in exactly the same place," 
explained the waiter. He smiled. He had a wonderful feeling that he had finally won through against what had seemed to be insuperable odds. 
"That's it!" said Zaphod, "I got it. I told the computer to send us to the nearest place to eat, that's exactly what it did. Give or take five hundred and seventy-six thousand million years, we never moved. Neat." 
They all agreed this was very neat. 
"But who," said Zaphod, "is the cat on the phone?" 
"Whatever happened to Marvin?" said Trillian. 
Zaphod clapped his hands to his heads. 
"The Paranoid Android! I left him moping about on Frogstar B." 
"When was this?" 
"Well, er, five hundred and seventy-six thousand million years ago I suppose," said Zaphod, "Hey, er, hand me the rap-rod, Plate Captain." 
The little waiter's eyebrows wandered about his forehead in confusion. 
"I beg your pardon, sir?" he said. 
"The phone, waiter," said Zaphod, grabbing it off him. "Shee, you guys are so unhip it's a wonder your bums don't fall off." 
"Indeed, sir." 
"Hey, Marvin, is that you?" said Zaphod into the phone, "How you doing, kid?" 
There was a long pause before a thin low voice came up the line. "I think you ought to know I'm feeling very depressed," it said. Zaphod cupped his hands over the phone.â¨"It's Marvin," he said. 
"Hey, Marvin," he said into the phone again, "we're having a great time. Food, wine, a little personal abuse and the Universe going foom. Where can we find you?" 
Again the pause. 
"You don't have to pretend to be interested in me you know," said Marvin at last, "I know perfectly well I'm only a menial robot." 
"OK, OK," said Zaphod, "but where are you?" 
"'Reverse primary thrust, Marvin,' that's what they say to me, 'open airlock number three, Marvin. Marvin, can you pick up that piece of paper?' Can I pick up that piece of paper! Here I am, brain the size of a planet and they ask me to..." 
"Yeah, yeah," sympathized Zaphod hardly at all. 
"But I'm quite used to being humiliated," droned Marvin, "I can even go and stick my head in a bucket of water if you like. Would you like me to go and stick my head in a bucket of water? I've got one ready. Wait a minute." 
"Er, hey, Marvin..." interrupted Zaphod, but it was too late. Sad little clunks and gurgles came up the line. 
"What's he saying?" asked Trillian. 
"Nothing," said Zaphod, "he just phoned up to wash his head at us." 
"There," said Marvin, coming back on the line and bubbling a bit, "I hope that gave satisfaction..." 
"Yeah, yeah," said Zaphod, "now will you please tell us where you are?" 
"I'm in the car park," said Marvin. 
"The car park?" said Zaphod, "what are you doing there?" 
"Parking cars, what else does one do in a car park?" 
"OK, hang in there, we'll be right down." 
In one movement Zaphod leapt to his feet, threw down the phone and wrote "Hotblack Desiato" on the bill. 
"Come on guys," he said, "Marvin's in the car park. Let's get on down." 
"What's he doing in the car park?" asked Arthur. 
"Parking cars, what else? Dum dum." 
"But what about the End of the Universe? We'll miss the big moment." 
"I've seen it. It's rubbish," said Zaphod, "nothing but a gnab gib." "A what?"â¨"Opposite of a big bang. Come on, let's get zappy." 
Few of the other diners paid them any attention as they weaved their way through the Restaurant to the exit. Their eyes were riveted on the horror of the skies. 
"An interesting effect to watch for," Max was telling them, "is in the upper left-hand quadrant of the sky, where if you look very carefully you can see the star system Hastromil boiling away into the ultra-violet. Anyone here from Hastromil?" 
There were one or two slightly hesitant cheers from somewhere at the back. 
"Well," said Max beaming cheerfully at them, "it's too late to worry about whether you left the gas on now." 
Chapter 18 
The main reception foyer was almost empty but Ford nevertheless weaved his way through it. 
Zaphod grasped him firmly by the arm and manoeuvred him into a cubicle standing to one side of the entrance hall. 
"What are you doing to him?" asked Arthur. 
"Sobering him up," said Zaphod and pushed a coin into a slot. Lights flashed, gases swirled. 
"Hi," said Ford stepping out a moment later, "where are we going?" 
"Down to the car park, come on." 
"What about the personnel Time Teleports?" said Ford, "Get us straight back to the Heart of Gold." 
"Yeah, but I've cooled on that ship. Zarniwoop can have it. I don't want to play his games. Let's see what we can find." 
A Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Happy Vertical People Transporter took them down deep into the substrata beneath the Restaurant. They were glad to see it had been vandalized and didn't try to make them happy as well as take them down. 
At the bottom of the shaft the lift doors opened and a blast of cold stale air hit them. 
The first thing they saw on leaving the lift was a long concrete wall with over fifty doors in it offering lavatory facilities for all of fifty major lifeforms. Nevertheless, like every car park in the Galaxy throughout the entire history of car parks, this car park smelt predominantly of impatience. 
They turned a corner and found themselves on a moving catwalk that traversed a vast cavernous space that stretched off into the dim distance. 
It was divided off into bays each of which contained a space ship belonging to one of the diners upstairs, some smallish and utilitarian 
mass production models, others vast shining limoships, the playthings of the very rich. 
Zaphod's eyes sparkled with something that may or may not have been avarice as he passed over them. In fact it's best to be clear on this point-avarice is definitely what it was. 
"There he is," said Trillian, "Marvin, down there." 
They looked where she was pointing. Dimly they could see a small metal figure listlessly rubbing a small rag on one remote corner of a giant silver suncruiser. 
At short intervals along the moving catwalk, wide transparent tubes led down to floor level. Zaphod stepped off the catwalk into one and floated gently downwards. The others followed. Thinking back to this later, Arthur Dent thought it was the single most enjoyable experience of his travels in the Galaxy. 
"Hey, Marvin," said Zaphod striding over towards to him, "Hey, kid, are we pleased to see you." 
Marvin turned, and in so far as it is possible for a totally inert metal face to look reproachfully, this is what it did. 
"No you're not," he said, "no one ever is." 
"Suit yourself," said Zaphod and turned away to ogle the ships. Ford went with him. 
Only Trillian and Arthur actually went up to Marvin. 
"No, really we are," said Trillian and patted him in a way that he disliked intensely, "hanging around waiting for us all this time." 
"Five hundred and seventy-six thousand million, three thousand five hundred and seventy-nine years," said Marvin, "I counted them." 
"Well, here we are now," said Trillian, feeling quite correctly in Marvin's view that it was a slightly foolish thing to say. 
"The first ten million years were the worst," said Marvin, "and the second ten million years, they were the worst too. The third million years I didn't enjoy at all. After that I went into a bit of decline." 
He paused just long enough to make them feel they ought to say something, and then interrupted. 
"It's the people you meet in this job that really get you down," he said and paused again. 
Trillian cleared her throat. 
"Is that..." 
"The best conversation I had was over forty million years ago," continued Marvin. 
Again the pause. 
"Oh d..." 
"And that was with a coffee machine." 
He waited. 
"That's a..." 
"You don't like talking to me do you?" said Marvin in a low desolate tone. 
Trillian talked to Arthur instead. 
Further down the chamber Ford Prefect had found something of which he very much liked the look, several such things in fact. 
"Zaphod," he said in a quiet voice, "just look at some of these little star trolleys..." 
Zaphod looked and liked. 
The craft they were looking at was in fact pretty small but extraordinary, and very much a rich kid's toy. It was not much to look at. It resembled nothing so much as a paper dart about twenty feet long made of thin but tough metal foil. At the rear end was a small horizontal two-man cockpit. It had a tiny charm-drive engine, which was not capable of moving it at any great speed. The thing it did have, however, was a heat-sink. 
The heat-sink had a mass of some two thousand billion tons and was contained within a black hole mounted in an electromagnetic field situated half-way along the length of the ship, and this heat-sink enabled the craft to be manoeuvred to within a few miles of a yellow sun, there to catch and ride the solar flares that burst out from its surface. 
Flare-riding is one of the most exotic and exhilarating sports in existence, and those who can dare and afford it are amongst the most lionized men in the Galaxy. It is also of course stupefyingly dangerous those who don't die riding invariably die of sexual exhaustion at one of the Daedalus Club's AprÃ¨s-Flare parties. 
Ford and Zaphod looked and passed on. 
"And this baby," said Ford, "the tangerine star buggy with the black sunbusters..." 
Again, the star buggy was a small ship a totally misnamed one in fact, because the one thing it couldn't manage was interstellar distances. Basically it was a sporty planet hopper dolled up to something it wasn't. Nice lines though. They passed on. 
The next one was a big one and thirty yards long a coach built limoship and obviously designed with one aim in mind, that of making the beholder sick with envy. The paintwork and accessory detail clearly said "Not only am I rich enough to afford this ship, I am also rich enough not to take it seriously." It was wonderfully hideous. 
"Just look at it," said Zaphod, "multi-cluster quark drive, perspulex running boards. Got to be a Lazlar Lyricon custom job." 
He examined every inch. 
"Yes," he said, "look, the infra-pink lizard emblem on the neutrino cowling. Lazlar's trade mark. The man has no shame." 
"I was passed by one of these mothers once, out by the Axel Nebula," said Ford, "I was going flat out and this thing just strolled past me, star drive hardly ticking over. Just incredible." 
Zaphod whistled appreciatively. 
"Ten seconds later", said Ford, "it smashed straight into the third moon of Jaglan Beta." 
"Yeah, right?" 
"Amazing looking ship though. Looks like a fish, moves like a fish, steers like a cow." 
Ford looked round the other side. 
"Hey, come and see," he called out, "there's a big mural painted on this side. A bursting sun Disaster Area's trade mark. This must be Hotblack's ship. Lucky old bugger. They do this terrible song you know which ends with a stuntship crashing into the sun. Meant to be an amazing spectacle. Expensive in stunt ships though." 
Zaphod's attention however was elsewhere. His attention was riveted on the ship standing next to Hotblack Desiato's limo. His mouths hung open. 
"That," he said, "that... is really bad for the eyes..." 
Ford looked. He too stood astonished. 
It was a ship of classic, simple design, like a flattened salmon, twenty yards long, very clean, very sleek. There was just one remarkable thing about it. 
"It's so... black!" said Ford Prefect, "you can hardly make out its shape... light just seems to fall into it!" 
Zaphod said nothing. He had simply fallen in love. 
The blackness of it was so extreme that it was almost impossible to tell how close you were standing to it. 
"Your eyes just slide off it..." said Ford in wonder. It was an emotional moment. He bit his lip. 
Zaphod moved forward to it, slowly, like a man possessed or more accurately like a man who wanted to possess. His hand reached out to stroke it. His hand stopped. His hand reached out to stroke it again. His hand stopped again. 
"Come and feel the surface," he said in a hushed voice. 
Ford put his hand out to feel it. His hand stopped. 
"You... you can't..." he said. 
"See?" said Zaphod, "it's just totally frictionless. This must be one mother of a mover..." 
He turned to look at Ford seriously. At least, one of his heads did the other stayed gazing in awe at the ship. 
"What do you reckon, Ford?" he said. 
"You mean... er..." Ford looked over his shoulder. "You mean stroll off with it? You think we should?" 
"No." 
"Nor do I." 
"But we're going to, aren't we?" 
"How can we not?" 
They gazed a little longer, till Zaphod suddenly pulled himself together. 
"We better shift soon," he said. "In a moment or so the Universe will have ended and all the Captain Creeps will be pouring down here to find their bourge-mobiles." 
"Zaphod," said Ford. 
"Yeah?"â¨"How do we do it?"â¨"Simple," said Zaphod. He turned. "Marvin!" he called. 
Slowly, laboriously, and with a million little clanking and creaking noises that he had learned to simulate, Marvin turned round to answer the summons. 
"Come on over here," said Zaphod, "We've got a job for you." 
Marvin trudged towards them. 
"I won't enjoy it," he said. 
"Yes you will," enthused Zaphod, "there's a whole new life stretching out ahead of you." 
"Oh, not another one," groaned Marvin. 
"Will you shut up and listen!" hissed Zaphod, "this time there's going to be excitement and adventure and really wild things." 
"Sounds awful," Marvin said. 
"Marvin! All I'm trying to ask you..." 
"I suppose you want me to open this spaceship for you?" 
"What? Er... yes. Yeah, that's right," said Zaphod jumpily. He was keeping at least three eyes on the entrance. Time was short. 
"Well I wish you'd just tell me rather than try to engage my enthusiasm," said Marvin, "because I haven't got one." 
He walked on up to the ship, touched it, and a hatchway swung open. 
Ford and Zaphod stared at the opening. 
"Don't mention it," said Marvin, "Oh, you didn't." He trudged away again. 
Arthur and Trillian clustered round.â¨"What's happening?" asked Arthur.â¨"Look at this," said Ford, "look at the interior of this ship." "Weirder and weirder," breathed Zaphod.â¨"It's black," said Ford, "Everything in it is just totally black..." 
In the Restaurant, things were fast approaching the moment after which there wouldn't be any more moments. 
All eyes were fixed on the dome, other than those of Hotblack Desiato's bodyguard, which were looking intently at Hotblack Desiato, and those of Hotblack Desiato himself which the bodyguard had closed out of respect. 
The bodyguard leaned forward over the table. Had Hotblack Desiato been alive, he probably would have deemed this a good moment to lean back, or even go for a short walk. His bodyguard was not a man which improved with proximity. On account of his unfortunate condition, however, Hotblack Desiato remained totally inert. 
"Mr. Desiato, sir?" whispered the bodyguard. Whenever he spoke, it looked as if the muscles on either side of his mouth were clambering over each other to get out of the way. 
"Mr. Desiato? Can you hear me?" 
Hotblack Desiato, quit naturally, said nothing. 
"Hotblack?" hissed the bodyguard. 
Again, quite naturally, Hotblack Desiato did not reply. Supernaturally, however, he did. 
On the table in front of him a wine glass rattled, and a fork rose an inch or so and tapped against the glass. It settled on the table again. 
The bodyguard gave a satisfied grunt. 
"It's time we get going, Mr. Desiato," muttered the bodyguard, "don't want to get caught in the rush, not in your condition. You want to get to the next gig nice and relaxed. There was a really big audience for it. One of the best. Kakrafoon. Five-hundred seventy-six thousand and two million years ago. Had you will have been looking forward to it?" 
The fork rose again, waggled in a non-committal sort of way and dropped again. 
"Ah, come on," said the bodyguard, "it's going to have been great. You knocked 'em cold." The bodyguard would have given Dr. Dan Streetmentioner an apoplectic attack. 
"The black ship going into the sun always gets 'em, and the new one's a beauty. Be real sorry to see it go. If we get on down there, I'll set the black ship autopilot and we'll cruise off in the limo. OK?" 
The fork tapped once in agreement, and the glass of wine mysteriously emptied itself. 
The bodyguard wheeled Hotblack Desiato's chair out of the Restaurant. 
"And now," cried Max from the centre of the stage, "the moment you've all been waiting for!" He flung his arms into the air. Behind him, the band went into a frenzy of percussion and rolling synthochords. Max had argued with them about this but they had claimed it was in their contract that that's what they would do. His agent would haveâ¨to sort it out. 
"The skies begin to boil!" he cried. "Nature collapses into the screaming void! In twenty seconds' time, the Universe itself will be at an end! See where the light of infinity bursts in upon us!" 
The hideous fury of destruction blazed about them and at that moment a still small trumpet sounded as from an infinite distance. Max's eyes swivelled round to glare at the band. None of them seemed to be playing a trumpet. Suddenly a wisp of smoke was swirling and shimmering on the stage next to him. The trumpet was joined by more trumpets. Over five hundred times Max had done this show, and nothing like this had ever happened before. He drew back in alarm from the swirling smoke, and as he did so, a figure slowly materialized inside, the figure of an ancient man, bearded, robed and wreathed in light. In his eyes were stars and on his brow a golden crown. 
"What's this?" whispered Max, wild-eyed, "what's happening?" 
At the back of the Restaurant the stony-faced party from the Church of the Second Coming of the Great Prophet Zarquon leapt ecstatically to their feet chanting and crying. 
Max blinked in amazement. He threw up his arms to the audience. 
"A big hand please, ladies and gentlemen," he hollered, "for the Great Prophet Zarquon! He has come! Zarquon has come again!" 
Thunderous applause broke out as Max strode across the stage and handed his microphone to the Prophet. 
Zarquon coughed. He peered round at the assembled gathering. The stars in his eyes blinked uneasily. He handled the microphone with confusion. 
"Er..." he said, "hello. Er, look, I'm sorry I'm a bit late. I've had the most ghastly time, all sorts of things cropping up at the last moment." 
He seemed nervous of the expectant awed hush. He cleared his throat. 
"Er, how are we for time?" he said, "have I just got a min " And so the Universe ended. 
Chapter 19 
One of the major selling point of that wholly remarkable travel book, the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, apart from its relative cheapness and the fact that it has the words DON'T PANIC written in large friendly letters on its cover, is its compendious and occasionally accurate glossary. The statistics relating to the geo-social nature of the Universe, for instance, are deftly set out between pages nine hundred and thirty-eight thousand and twenty-four and nine hundred and thirty-eight thousand and twenty-six; and the simplistic style in which they are written is partly explained by the fact that the editors, having to meet a publishing deadline, copied the information off the back of a packet of breakfast cereal, hastily embroidering it with a few footnoted in order to avoid prosecution under the incomprehensibly tortuous Galactic Copyright laws. 
It is interesting to note that a later and wilier editor sent the book backwards in time through a temporal warp, and then successfully sued the breakfast cereal company for infringement of the same laws. 
Here is a sample: 
The Universe some information to help you live in it. 
1~Area: Infinite. 
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy offers this definition of the word "Infinite". 
Infinite: Bigger than the biggest thing ever and then some. Much bigger than that in fact, really amazingly immense, a totally stunning size, "wow, that's big", time. Infinity is just so big that by comparison, bigness itself looks really titchy. Gigantic multiplied by colossal multiplied by staggeringly huge is the sort of concept we're trying to get across here. 
2~Imports: None. 
It is impossible to import things into an infinite area, there being no outside to import things in from. 
3~Exports: None. See imports. 4~Population: None. 
It is known that there are an infinite number of worlds, simply because there is an infinite amount of space for them to be in. However, not every one of them is inhabited. Therefore, there must be a finite number of inhabited worlds. Any finite number divided by infinity is as near to nothing as makes no odds, so the average population of all the planets in the Universe can be said to be zero. From this it follows that the population of the whole Universe is also zero, and that any people you may meet from time to time are merely the products of a deranged imagination. 
5~Monetary Units: None. 
In fact there are three freely convertible currencies in the Galaxy, but none of them count. The Altairan Dollar has recently collapsed, the Flaninian Pobble Bead is only exchangeable for other Flaninian Pobble Beads, and the Triganic Pu has its own very special problems. Its exchange rate of eight Ningis to one Pu is simple enough, but since a Ningi is a triangular rubber coin six thousand eight hundred miles across each side, no one has ever collected enough to own one Pu. Ningis are not negotiable currency because the Galactibanks refuse to deal in fiddling small change. From this basic premise it is very simple to prove that the Galactibanks are also the product of a deranged imagination. 
6~Art: None. 
The function of art is to hold the mirror up to nature, and there simply isn't a mirror big enough see point one. 
7~Sex: None. 
Well, in fact there is an awful lot of this, largely because of the total lack of money, trade, banks, art, or anything else that might keep all the non-existent people of the Universe occupied. 
However, it is not worth embarking on a long discussion of it now because it really is terribly complicated. For further information see Guide chapters seven, nine, ten, eleven, fourteen, sixteen, seventeen, nineteen, twenty-one to eighty-four inclusive, and in fact most of the rest of the Guide. 
Chapter 20 
The Restaurant continued existing, but everything else had stopped. Temporal relastatics held it and protected it in a nothingness that wasn't merely a vacuum, it was simply nothing there was nothing in which a vacuum could be said to exist. 
The force-shielded dome had once again been rendered opaque, the party was over, the diners were leaving, Zarquon had vanished along with the rest of the Universe, the Time Turbines were preparing to pull the Restaurant back across the brink of time in readiness for the lunch sitting, and Max Quordlepleen was back in his small curtained dressing room trying to raise his agent on the tempophone. 
In the car park stood the black ship, closed and silent. 
In to the car park came the late Mr. Hotblack Desiato, propelled along the moving catwalk by his bodyguard. 
They descended one of the tubes. As they approached the limoship a hatchway swung down from its side, engaged the wheels of the wheelchair and drew it inside. The bodyguard followed, and having seen his boss safely connected up to his death-support system, moved up to the small cockpit. Here he operated the remote control system which activated the autopilot in the black ship lying next to the limo, thus causing great relief to Zaphod Beeblebrox who had been trying to start the thing for over ten minutes. 
The black ship glided smoothly forward out of its bay, turned, and moved down the central causeway swiftly and quietly. At the end it accelerated rapidly, flung itself into the temporal launch chamber and began the long journey back into the distant past. 
The Milliways Lunch Menu quotes, by permission, a passage from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The passage is this: 
The History of every major Galactic Civilization tends to pass through three distinct and recognizable phases, those of Survival, 
Inquiry and Sophistication, otherwise known as the How, Why and Where phases. 
For instance, the first phase is characterized by the question "How can we eat?", the second by the question "Why do we eat?" and the third by the question, "Where shall we have lunch?" 
The Menu goes on to suggest that Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, would be a very agreeable and sophisticated answer to that third question. 
What it doesn't go on to say is that though it will usually take a large civilization many thousands of years to pass through the How, Why and Where phases, small social groupings under stressful conditions can pass through them with extreme rapidity. 
"How are we doing?" said Arthur Dent. 
"Badly," said Ford Prefect. 
"Where are we going?" said Trillian. 
"I don't know," said Zaphod Beeblebrox. 
"Why not?" demanded Arthur Dent. 
"Shut up," suggested Zaphod Beeblebrox and Ford Prefect. 
"Basically, what you're trying to say," said Arthur Dent, ignoring this suggestion, "is that we're out of control." 
The ship was rocking and swaying sickeningly as Ford and Zaphod tried to wrest control from the autopilot. The engined howled and whined like tired children in a supermarket. 
"It's the wild colour scheme that freaks me," said Zaphod whose love affair with this ship had lasted almost three minutes into the flight, "Every time you try to operate on of these weird black controls that are labelled in black on a black background, a little black light lights up black to let you know you've done it. What is this? Some kind of galactic hyperhearse?" 
The walls of the swaying cabin were also black, the ceiling was black, the seats which were rudimentary since the only important trip this ship was designed for was supposed to be unmanned were black, the control panel was black, the instruments were black, the little screws that held them in place were black, the thin tufted nylon floor covering was black, and when they had lifted up a corner of it they had discovered that the foam underlay also was black. 
"Perhaps whoever designed it had eyes that responded to different wavelengths," offered Trillian. 
"Or didn't have much imagination," muttered Arthur. 
"Perhaps," said Marvin, "he was feeling very depressed." 
In fact, though they weren't to know it, the decor had been chosen in honour of its owner's sad, lamented, and tax-deductible condition. 
The ship gave a particularly sickening lurch. 
"Take it easy," pleaded Arthur, "you're making me space sick." 
"Time sick," said Ford, "we're plummeting backwards through time." 
"Thank you," said Arthur, "now I think I really am going to be ill." 
"Go ahead," said Zaphod, "we could do with a little colour about this place." 
"This is meant to be a polite after-dinner conversation is it?" snapped Arthur. 
Zaphod left the controls for Ford to figure out, and lurched over to Arthur. 
"Look, Earthman," he said angrily, "you've got a job to do, right? The Question to the Ultimate Answer, right?" 
"What, that thing?" said Arthur, "I thought we'd forgotten about that." 
"Not me, baby. Like the mice said, it's worth a lot of money in the right quarters. And it's all locked up in that head thing of yours." 
"Yes but..." 
"But nothing! Think about it. The Meaning of Life! We get our fingers on that we can hold every shrink in the Galaxy up to ransom, and that's worth a bundle. I owe mine a mint." 
Arthur took a deep breath without much enthusiasm. 
"Alright," he said, "but where do we start? How should I know? They say the Ultimate Answer or whatever is Forty-two, how am I supposed to know what the question is? It could be anything. I mean, what's six times seven?" 
Zaphod looked at him hard for a moment. Then his eyes blazed with excitement. 
"Forty-two!" he cried.â¨Arthur wiped his palm across his forehead. 
"Yes," he said patiently," I know that." 
Zaphod's faces fell. 
"I'm just saying that the question could be anything at all," said Arthur, "and I don't see how I am meant to know." 
"Because," hissed Zaphod, "you were there when your planet did the big firework." 
"We have a thing on Earth..." began Arthur. 
"Had," corrected Zaphod. 
"... called tact. Oh never mind. Look, I just don't know." 
A low voice echoed dully round the cabin. 
"I know," said Marvin. 
Ford called out from the controls he was still fighting a losing battle with. 
"Stay out of this Marvin," he said, "this is organism talk." 
"It's printed in the Earthman's brainwave patterns," continued Marvin, "but I don't suppose you'll be very interested in knowing that." 
"You mean," said Arthur, "you mean you can see into my mind?" "Yes," said Marvin.â¨Arthur stared in astonishment.â¨"And...?" he said. 
"It amazes me how you can manage to live in anything that small." "Ah," said Arthur, "abuse."â¨"Yes," confirmed Marvin.â¨"Ah, ignore him," said Zaphod, "he's only making it up." 
"Making it up?" said Marvin, swivelling his head in a parody of astonishment, "Why should I want to make anything up? Life's bad enough as it is without wanting to invent any more of it." 
"Marvin," said Trillian in the gentle, kindly voice that only she was still capable of assuming in talking to this misbegotten creature, "if you knew all along, why then didn't you tell us?" 
Marvin's head swivelled back to her. 
"You didn't ask," he said simply. 
"Well, we're asking you now, metal man," said Ford, turning round to look at him. 
At that moment the ship suddenly stopped rocking and swaying, the engine pitch settled down to a gentle hum. 
"Hey, Ford," said Zaphod, "that sounds good. Have you worked out the controls of this boat?" 
"No," said Ford, "I just stopped fiddling with them. I reckon we just go to wherever this ship is going and get off it fast." 
"Yeah, right," said Zaphod. 
"I could tell you weren't really interested," murmured Marvin to himself and slumped into a corner and switched himself off. 
"Trouble is," said Ford, "that the one instrument in this while ship that is giving any reading is worrying me. If it is what I think it is, and if it's saying what I think it's saying, then we've already gone too far back into the past. Maybe as much as two million years before our own time." 
Zaphod shrugged. 
"Time is bunk," he said. 
"I wonder who this ship belongs to anyway," said Arthur. 
"Me," said Zaphod. 
"No. Who it really belongs to." 
"Really me," insisted Zaphod, "look, property is theft, right? Therefore theft is property. Therefore this ship is mine, OK?" 
"Tell the ship that," said Arthur. 
Zaphod strode over to the console. 
"Ship," he said, banging on the panels, "this is your new owner speaking to..." 
He got no further. Several things happened at once. 
The ship dropped out of time travel mode and re-emerged into real space. 
All the controls on the console, which had been shut down for the time trip now lit up. 
A large vision screen above the console winked into life revealing a wide starscape and a single very large sun dead ahead of them. 
None of these things, however, were responsible for the fact that Zaphod was at the same moment hurled bodily backwards against the rear of the cabin, as were all the others. 
They were hurled back by a single thunderous clap of noise that thuddered out of the monitor speakers surrounding the vision screen. 
Chapter 21 
Down on the dry, red world of Kakrafoon, in the middle of the vast Rudlit Desert, the stage technicians were testing the sound system. 
That is to say, the sound system was in the desert, not the stage technicians. They had retreated to the safety of Disaster Area's giant control ship which hung in orbit some four hundred miles above the surface of the planet, and they were testing the sound system from there. Anyone within five miles of the speaker silos wouldn't have survived the tuning up. 
If Arthur Dent had been within five miles of the speaker silos then his expiring thought would have been that in both size and shape the sound rig closely resembled Manhattan. Risen out of the silos, the neutron phase speaker stacks towered monstrously against the sky, obscuring the banks of plutonium reactors and seismic amps behind them. 
Buried deep in concrete bunkers beneath the city of speakers lay the instruments that the musicians would control from their ship, the massive photon-ajuitar, the bass detonator and the Megabang drum complex. 
It was going to be a noisy show. 
Aboard the giant control ship, all was activity and bustle. Hotblack Desiato's limoship, a mere tadpole beside it, had arrived and docked, and the lamented gentleman was being transported down the high vaulted corridors to meet the medium who was going to interpret his psychic impulses on to the ajuitar keyboard. 
A doctor, a logician and a marine biologist had also just arrived, flown in at phenomenal expense from Maximegalon to try to reason with the lead singer who had locked himself in the bathroom with a bottle of pills and was refusing to come out till it could be proved conclusively to him that he wasn't a fish. The bass player was busy machine-gunning his bedroom and the drummer was nowhere on board. 
Frantic inquiries led to the discovery that he was standing on a beach on Santraginus V over a hundred light years away where, he claimed, he had been happy over half an hour now and had found a small stone that would be his friend. 
The band's manager was profoundly relieved. It meant that for the seventeenth time on this tour the drums would be played by a robot and that therefore the timing of the cymbalistics would be right. 
The sub-ether was buzzing with the communications of the stage technicians testing the speaker channels, and this it was that was being relayed to the interior of the black ship. 
Its dazed occupants lay against the back wall of the cabin, and listened to the voices on the monitor speakers. 
"OK, channel nine on power," said a voice, "testing channel fifteen..." 
Another thumping crack of noise walloped through the ship. 
"Channel fifteen AOK," said another voice. 
A third voice cut in. 
"The black stunt ship is now in position," it said, "it's looking good. Gonna be a great sundive. Stage computer on line?" 
A computer voice answered.â¨"On line," it said.â¨"Take control of the black ship."â¨"Black ship locked into trajectory programme, on standby." "Testing channel twenty." 
Zaphod leaped across the cabin and switched frequencies on the sub-ether receiver before the next mind-pulverizing noise hit them. He stood there quivering. 
"What," said Trillian in a small quiet voice, "does sundive mean?" 
"It means," said Marvin, "that the ship os going to dive into the sun. Sun... Dive. It's very simple to understand. What do you expect if you steal Hotblack Desiato's stunt ship?" 
"How do you know..." said Zaphod in a voice that would make a Vegan snow lizard feel chilly, "that this is Hotblack Desiato's stuntship?" 
"Simple," said Marvin, "I parked it for him." "The why... didn't... you... tell us!" 
"You said you wanted excitement and adventure and really wild things." 
"This is awful," said Arthur unnecessarily in the pause which followed. 
"That's what I said," confirmed Marvin. 
On a different frequency, the sub-ether receiver had picked up a public broadcast, which now echoed round the cabin. 
"... fine weather for the concert here this afternoon. I'm standing here in front of the stage," the reporter lied, "in the middle of the Rudlit Desert, and with the aid of hyperbinoptic glasses I can just about make out the huge audience cowering there on the horizon all around me. Behind me the speaker stacks rise like a sheer cliff face, and high above me the sun is shining away and doesn't know what's going to hit it. The environmentalist lobby do know what's going to hit it, and they claim that the concert will cause earthquakes, tidal waves, hurricanes, irreparable damage to the atmosphere, and all the usual things that environmentalists usually go on about. 
"But I've just had a report that a representative of Disaster Area met with the environmentalists at lunchtime, and had them all shot, so nothing now lies in the way of..." 
Zaphod switched it off. He turned to Ford. "You know what I'm thinking?" he said.â¨"I think so," said Ford.â¨"Tell me what you think I'm thinking." 
"I think you're thinking it's time we get off this ship." "I think you're right," said Zaphod.â¨"I think you're right," said Ford.â¨"How?" said Arthur. 
"Quiet," said Ford and Zaphod, "we're thinking." "So this is it," said Arthur, "we're going to die." "I wish you'd stop saying that," said Ford. 
It is worth repeating at this point the theories that Ford had come up with, on his first encounter with human beings, to account for their peculiar habit of continually stating and restating the very very obvious, as it 'It's a nice day," or "You're very tall," or "So this is it, we're going to die." 
His first theory was that if human beings didn't keep exercising their lips, their mouths probably seized up. 
After a few months of observation he had come up with a second theory, which was this "If human beings don't keep exercising their lips, their brains start working." 
In fact, this second theory is more literally true of the Belcebron people of Kakrafoon. 
The Belcebron people used to cause great resentment and insecurity amongst neighboring races by being one of the most enlightened, accomplished, and above all quiet civilizations in the Galaxy. 
As a punishment for this behaviour, which was held to be offensively self righteous and provocative, a Galactic Tribunal inflicted on them that most cruel of all social diseases, telepathy. Consequently, in order to prevent themselves broadcasting every slightest thought that crossed their minds to anyone within a five mile radius, they now have to talk very loudly and continuously about the weather, their little aches and pains, the match this afternoon and what a noisy place Kakrafoon had suddenly become. 
Another method of temporarily blotting out their minds is to play host to a Disaster Area concert. 
The timing of the concert was critical. 
The ship had to begin its dive before the concert began in order to hit the sun six minutes and thirty-seven seconds before the climax of the song to which it related, so that the light of the solar flares had time to travel out to Kakrafoon. 
The ship had already been diving for several minutes by the time that Ford Prefect had completed his search of the other compartments of the black ship. He burst back into the cabin. 
The sun of Kakrafoon loomed terrifyingly large on the vision screen, its blazing white inferno of fusing hydrogen nuclei growing moment by moment as the ship plunged onwards, unheeding the thumping and banging of Zaphod's hands on the control panel. Arthur and Trillian had the fixed expressions of rabbits on a night road who think that the best way of dealing with approaching headlights is to stare them out. 
Zaphod span round, wild-eyed. 
"Ford," he said, "how many escape capsules are there?" "None," said Ford.â¨Zaphod gibbered.â¨"Did you count them?" he yelled. 
"Twice," said Ford, "did you manage to raise the stage crew on the radio?" 
"Yeah," said Zaphod, bitterly, "I said there were a whole bunch of people on board, and they said to say 'hi' to everybody." 
Ford goggled. 
"Didn't you tell them who we were?" 
"Oh yeah. They said it was a great honour. That and something about a restaurant bill and my executors." 
Ford pushed Arthur aside and leaned forward over the control console. 
"Does none of this function?" he said savagely. "All overridden."â¨"Smash the autopilot."â¨"Find it first. Nothing connects." 
There was a moment's cold silence. 
Arthur was stumbling round the back of the cabin. He stopped suddenly. 
"Incidentally," he said, "what does teleport mean?" Another moment passed.â¨Slowly, the others turned to face him. 
"Probably the wrong moment to ask," said Arthur, "It's just I remember hearing you use the word a short while ago and I only bring it up because..." 
"Where," said Ford Prefect quietly, "does it say teleport?" 
"Well, just over here in fact," said Arthur, pointing at a dark control box in the rear of the cabin, "Just under the word 'emergency', above the word 'system' and beside the sign saying 'out of order'." 
In the pandemonium that instantly followed, the only action to follow was that of Ford Prefect lunging across the cabin to the small black box that Arthur had indicated and stabbing repeatedly at the single small black button set into it. 
A six-foot square panel slid open beside it revealing a compartment which resembled a multiple shower unit that had found a new function in life as an electrician's junk store. Half-finished wiring hung from the ceiling, a jumble of abandoned components lay strewn on the floor, and the programming panel lolled out of the cavity in the wall into which it should have been secured. 
A junior Disaster Area accountant, visiting the shipyard where this ship was being constructed, had demanded to know of the works foreman why the hell they were fitting an extremely expensive teleport into a ship which only had one important journey to make, and that unmanned. The foreman had explained that the teleport was available at a ten percent discount and the accountant had explained that this was immaterial; the foreman had explained that it was the finest, most powerful and sophisticated teleport that money could buy and the accountant had explained that the money did not wish to buy it; the foreman had explained that people would still need to enter and leave the ship and the accountant had explained that the ship sported a perfectly serviceable door; the foreman had explained that the accountant could go and boil his head and the accountant had explained to the foreman that the thing approaching him rapidly from his left was a knuckle sandwich. After the explanations had been concluded, work was discontinued on the teleport which subsequently passed unnoticed on the invoice as "Sund. explns." at five times the price. 
"Hell's donkeys," muttered Zaphod as he and Ford attempted to sort through the tangle of wiring. 
After a moment or so Ford told him to stand back. He tossed a coin into the teleport and jiggled a switch on the lolling control panel. With a crackle and spit of light, the coin vanished. 
"That much of it works," said Ford, "however, there is no guidance system. A matter transference teleport without guidance programming could put you... well, anywhere." 
The sun of Kakrafoon loomed huge on the screen. 
"Who cares," said Zaphod, "we go where we go." 
"And," said Ford, "there is no autosystem. We couldn't all go. Someone would have to stay and operate it." 
A solemn moment shuffled past. The sun loomed larger and larger. 
"Hey, Marvin kid," said Zaphod brightly, "how you doing?" "Very badly I suspect," muttered Marvin. 
A shortish while later, the concert on Kakrafoon reached an unexpected climax. 
The black ship with its single morose occupant had plunged on schedule into the nuclear furnace of the sun. Massive solar flares licked out from it millions of miles into space, thrilling and in a few cases spilling the dozen or so Flare Riders who had been coasting close to the surface of the sun in anticipation of the moment. 
Moments before the flare light reached Kakrafoon the pounding desert cracked along a deep faultline. A huge and hitherto undetected underground river lying far beneath the surface gushed to the surface to be followed seconds later by the eruption of millions of tons of boiling lava that flowed hundreds of feet into the air, instantaneously vaporizing the river both above and below the surface in an explosion that echoed to the far side of the world and back again. 
Those-very few-who witnessed the event and survived swear that the whole hundred thousand square miles of the desert rose into the air like a mile-thick pancake, flipped itself over and fell back down. At that precise moment the solar radiation from the flares filtered through the clouds of vaporized water and struck the ground. 
A year later, the hundred thousand square mile desert was thick with flowers. The structure of the atmosphere around the planet was subtly altered. The sun blazed less harshly in the summer, the cold bit less bitterly in the winter, pleasant rain fell more often, and slowly the desert world of Kakrafoon became a paradise. Even the telepathic power with which the people of Kakrafoon had been cursed was permanently dispersed by the force of the explosion. 
A spokesman for Disaster Area the one who had had all the environmentalists shot was later quoted as saying that it had been "a good gig". 
Many people spoke movingly of the healing powers of music. A few sceptical scientists examined the records of the events more closely, and claimed that they had discovered faint vestiges of a vast artificially induced Improbability Field drifting in from a nearby region of space. 
Chapter 22 
Arthur woke up and instantly regretted it. Hangovers he'd had, but never anything on this scale. This was it, this was the big one, this was the ultimate pits. Matter transference beams, he decided, were not as much fun as, say, a good solid kick in the head. 
Being for the moment unwilling to move on account of a dull stomping throb he was experiencing, he lay a while and thought. The trouble with most forms of transport, he thought, is basically one of them not being worth all the bother. On Earth when there had been an Earth, before it was demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass the problem had been with cars. The disadvantages involved in pulling lots of black sticky slime from out of the ground where itâ¨had been safely hidden out of harm's way, turning it into tar to cover the land with, smoke to fill the air with and pouring the rest into the sea, all seemed to outweigh the advantages of being able to get more quickly from one place to another particularly when the place you arrived at had probably become, as a result of this, very similar to the place you had left, i.e. covered with tar, full of smoke and short of fish. 
And what about matter transference beams? Any form of transport which involved tearing you apart atom by atom, flinging those atoms through the sub-ether, and then jamming them back together again just when they were getting their first taste of freedom for years had to be bad news. 
Many people had thought exactly this before Arthur Dent and had even gone to the lengths of writing songs about it. Here is one that used regularly to be chanted by huge crowds outside the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Teleport Systems factory on Happi-Werld III: 
Aldebaran's great, OK, Algol's pretty neat, Betelgeuse's pretty girls, Will knock you off your feet. 
They'll do anything you like,â¨Real fast and then real slow,â¨But if you have to take me apart to get me there, Then I don't want to go. 
Singing,â¨Take me apart, take me apart,â¨What a way to roam,â¨And if you have to take me apart to get me there, I'd rather stay at home. 
Sirius is paved with goldâ¨So I've heard it saidâ¨By nuts who then go on to sayâ¨"See Tau before you're dead."â¨I'll gladly take the high roadâ¨Or even take the low,â¨But if you have to take me apart to get me there, Then I, for one, won't go. 
Singing,â¨Take me apart, take me apart, You must be off your head, And if you try to take me apart to get me there,â¨I'll stay right here in bed. 
... and so on. Another favorite song was much shorter: 
I teleported home one night, With Ron and Sid and Meg, Ron stole Meggie's heart away, And I got Sidney's leg. 
Arthur felt the waves of pain slowly receding, though he was still aware of a dull stomping throb. Slowly, carefully, he stood up. 
"Can you hear a dull stomping throb?" said Ford Prefect. 
Arthur span round and wobbled uncertainly. Ford Prefect was approaching looking red eyed and pasty. 
"Where are we?" gasped Arthur. 
Ford looked around. They were standing in a long curving corridor which stretched out of sight in both directions. The outer steel wall which was painted in that sickly shade of pale green which they use in schools, hospitals and mental asylums to keep the inmates subdued curved over the tops of their heads where it met the inner perpendicular wall which, oddly enough was covered in dark brown hessian wall weave. The floor was of dark green ribbed rubber. 
Ford moved over to a very thick dark transparent panel set in the outer wall. It was several layers deep, yet through it he could see pinpoints of distant stars. 
"I think we're in a spaceship of some kind," he said.â¨Down the corridor came the sound of a dull stomping throb. "Trillian?" called Arthur nervously, "Zaphod?"â¨Ford shrugged. 
"Nowhere about," he said, "I've looked. They could be anywhere. An unprogrammed teleport can throw you light years in any direction. Judging by the way I feel I should think we've travelled a very long way indeed." 
"How do you feel?" 
"Bad." 
"Do you think they're..." 
"Where they are, how they are, there's no way we can know and no way we can do anything about it. Do what I do." 
"What?" 
"Don't think about it." 
Arthur turned this thought over in his mind, reluctantly saw the wisdom of it, tucked it up and put it away. He took a deep breath. 
"Footsteps!" exclaimed Ford suddenly.â¨"Where?"â¨"That noise. That stomping throb. Pounding feet. Listen!" 
Arthur listened. The noise echoed round the corridor at them from an indeterminate distance. It was the muffled sound of pounding footsteps, and it was noticeably louder. 
"Let's move," said Ford sharply. They both moved-in opposite directions. 
"Not that way," said Ford, "that's where they're coming from." "No it's not," said Arthur, "They're coming from that way." "They're not, they're..." 
They both stopped. They both turned. They both listened intently. They both agreed with each other. They both set off into opposite directions again. 
Fear gripped them. 
From both directions the noise was getting louder. 
A few yards to their left another corridor ran at right angles to the inner wall. They ran to it and hurried along it. It was dark, immensely long and, as they passed down it, gave them the impression that it was getting colder and colder. Other corridors gave off it to the left and right, each very dark and each subjecting them to sharp blasts of icy air as they passed. 
They stopped for a moment in alarm. The further down the corridor they went, the louder became the sound of pounding feet. 
They pressed themselves back against the cold wall and listened furiously. The cold, the dark and the drumming of disembodied feet was getting to them badly. Ford shivered, partly with the cold, but partly with the memory of stories his favourite mother used to tell him when he was a mere slip of a Betelgeusian, ankle high to an Arcturan Megagrasshopper: stories of dead ships, haunted hulks that roamed restlessly round the obscurer regions of deep space infested with demons or the ghosts of forgotten crews; stories too of incautious travellers who found and entered such ships; stories of... then Ford remembered the brown hessian wall weave in the first corridor and pulled himself together. However ghosts and demons may choose to decorate their death hulks, he thought to himself, he would lay any money you liked it wasn't with hessian wall weave. He grasped Arthur by the arm. 
"Back the way we came," he said firmly and they started to retrace their steps. 
A moment later they leap like startled lizards down the nearest corridor junction as the owners of the drumming feet suddenly hove into view directly in front of them. 
Hidden behind the corner they goggled in amazement as about two dozen overweight men and women pounded past them in track suits panting and wheezing in a manner that would make a heart surgeon gibber. 
Ford Prefect stared after them. 
"Joggers!" he hissed, as the sound of their feet echoed away up and down the network of corridors. 
"Joggers?" whispered Arthur Dent. 
"Joggers," said Ford Prefect with a shrug. 
The corridor they were concealed in was not like the others. It was very short, and ended at a large steel door. Ford examined it, discovered the opening mechanism and pushed it wide. 
The first thing that hit their eyes was what appeared to be a coffin. 
And the next four thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine things that hit their eyes were also coffins. 
Chapter 23 
The vault was low ceilinged, dimly lit and gigantic. At the far end, about three hundred yards away an archway let through to what appeared to be a similar chamber, similarly occupied. 
Ford Prefect let out a low whistle as he stepped down on to the floor of the vault. 
"Wild," he said. 
"What's so great about dead people?" asked Arthur, nervously stepping down after him. 
"Dunno," said Ford, "Let's find out shall we?" 
On closer inspection the coffins seemed to be more like sarcophagi. They stood about waist high and were constructed of what appeared to be white marble, which is almost certainly what it was something that only appeared to be white marble. The tops were semi- translucent, and through them could dimly be perceived the features of their late and presumably lamented occupants. They were humanoid, and had clearly left the troubles of whatever world it was they came from far behind them, but beyond that little else could be discerned. 
Rolling slowly round the floor between the sarcophagi was a heavy, oily white gas which Arthur at first thought might be there to give the place a little atmosphere until he discovered that it also froze his ankles. The sarcophagi too were intensely cold to the touch. 
Ford suddenly crouched down beside one of them. He pulled a corner of his towel out of his satchel and started to rub furiously at something. 
"Look, there's a plaque on this one," he explained to Arthur, "It's frosted over." 
He rubbed the frost clear and examined the engraved characters. To Arthur they looked like the footprints of a spider that had had one too many of whatever it is that spiders have on a night out, but Ford instantly recognized an early form of Galactic Eezeereed. 
"It says 'Golgafrincham Ark Fleet, Ship B, Hold Seven, Telephone Sanitizer Second Class' and a serial number." 
"A telephone sanitizer?" said Arthur, "a dead telephone sanitizer?" "Best kind."â¨"But what's he doing here?"â¨Ford peered through the top at the figure within. 
"Not a lot," he said, and suddenly flashed one of those grins of his which always made people think he'd been overdoing things recently and should try to get some rest. 
He scampered over to another sarcophagus. A moment's brisk towel work and he announced: 
"This one's a dead hairdresser. Hoopy!" 
The next sarcophagus revealed itself to be the last resting place of an advertising account executive; the one after that contained a second-hand car salesman, third class. 
An inspection hatch let into the floor suddenly caught Ford's attention, and he squatted down to unfasten it, thrashing away at the clouds of freezing gas that threatened to envelope him. 
A thought occurred to Arthur. 
"If these are just coffins," he said, "Why are they kept so cold?" 
"Or, indeed, why are they kept anyway," said Ford tugging the hatchway open. The gas poured down through it. "Why in fact is anyone going to all the trouble and expense of carting five thousand dead bodies through space?" 
"Ten thousand," said Arthur, pointing at the archway through which the next chamber was dimly visible. 
Ford stuck his head down through the floor hatchway. He looked up again. 
"Fifteen thousand," he said, "there's another lot down there." 
"Fifteen million," said a voice. 
"That's a lot," said Ford, "A lot a lot." 
"Turn around slowly," barked the voice, "and put your hands up. Any other move and I blast you into tiny tiny bits." 
"Hello?" said Ford, turning round slowly, putting his hands up and not making any other move. 
"Why," said Arthur Dent, "isn't anyone ever pleased to see us?" 
Standing silhouetted in the doorway through which they had entered the vault was the man who wasn't pleased to see them. His displeasure was communicated partly by the barking hectoring quality of his voice and partly by the viciousness with which he waved a long silver Kill-O-Zap gun at them. The designer of the gun had clearly not been instructed to beat about the bush. "Make it evil," he'd been told. "Make it totally clear that this gun has a right end and a wrong end. Make it totally clear to anyone standing at the wrong end that things are going badly for them. If that means sticking all sort of spikes and prongs and blackened bits all over it then so be it. This is not a gun for hanging over the fireplace or sticking in the umbrella stand, it is a gun for going out and making people miserable with." 
Ford and Arthur looked at the gun unhappily. 
The man with the gun moved from the door and circled round them. As he came into the light they could see his black and gold uniform on which the buttons were so highly polished that they shone with an intensity that would have made an approaching motorist flash his lights in annoyance. 
He gestured at the door. 
"Out," he said. People who can supply that amount of fire power don't need to supply verbs as well. Ford and Arthur went out, closely followed by the wrong end of the Kill-O-Zap gun and the buttons. 
Turning into the corridor they were jostled by twenty-four oncoming joggers, now showered and changed, who swept on past them into the vault. Arthur turned to watch them in confusion. 
"Move!" screamed their captor. Arthur moved.â¨Ford shrugged and moved. 
In the vault the joggers went to twenty-four empty sarcophagi along the side wall, opened them, climbed in, and fell into twenty- four dreamless sleeps. 
Chapter 24 
"Er, captain..."â¨"Yes, Number One?"â¨"Just heard a sort of report thingy from Number Two." "Oh, dear." 
High up in the bridge of the ship, the Captain stared out into the infinite reaches of space with mild irritation. From where he reclined beneath a wide domed bubble he could see before and above them the vast panorama of stars through which they were moving a panorama that had thinned out noticably during the course of the voyage. Turning and looking backwards, over the vast two-mile bulk of the ship he could see the far denser mass of stars behind them which seemed to form almost a solid band. This was the view through the Galactic centre from which they were travelling, and indeed had been travelling for years, at a speed that he couldn't quite remember at the moment, but he knew it was terribly fast. It was something approaching the speed of something or other, or was it three times the speed of something else? Jolly impressive anyway. He peered into the bright distance behind the ship, looking for something. He did this every few minutes or so, but never found what he was looking for. He didn't let it worry him though. The scientist chaps had been very insistent that everything was going to be perfectly alright providing nobody panicked and everybody got on and did their bit in an orderly fashion. 
He wasn't panicking. As far as he was concerned everything was going splendidly. He dabbed at his shoulder with a large frothy sponge. It crept back into his mind that he was feeling mildly irritated about something. Now what was all that about? A slight cough alerted him to the fact that the ship's first officer was still standing nearby. 
Nice chap, Number One. Not of the very brightest, had the odd spot of difficulty doing up his shoe laces, but jolly good officer 
material for all that. The Captain wasn't a man to kick a chap when he was bending over trying to do up his shoe laces, however long it took him. Not like that ghastly Number Two, strutting about all over the place, polishing his buttons, issuing reports every hour: "Ship's still moving, Captain." "Still on course, Captain." "Oxygen levels still being maintained, Captain." "Give it a miss," was the Captain's vote. Ah yes, that was the thing that had been irritating him. He peered down at Number One. 
"Yes, Captain, he was shouting something or other about having found some prisoners..." 
The Captain thought about this. Seemed pretty unlikely to him, but he wasn't one to stand in his officers' way. 
"Well, perhaps that'll keep him happy for a bit," he said, "He's always wanted some." 
Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent trudged onwards up the ship's apparently endless corridors. Number Two marched behind them barking the occasional order about not making any false moves or trying any funny stuff. They seemed to have passed at least a mile of continuous brown hessian wall weave. Finally they reached a large steel door which slid open when Number Two shouted at it. 
They entered. 
To the eyes of Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent, the most remarkable thing about the ship's bridge was not the fifty foot diameter hemispherical dome which covered it, and through which the dazzling display of stars shone down on them: to people who have eaten at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, such wonders are commonplace. Nor was it the bewildering array of instruments that crowded the long circumferential wall around them. To Arthur this was exactly what spaceships were traditionally supposed to look like, and to Ford it looked thoroughly antiquated: it confirmed his suspicions that Disaster Area's stuntship had taken them back at least a million, if not two million, years before their own time. 
No, the thing that really caught them off balance was the bath. 
The bath stood on a six foot pedestal of rough hewn blue water crystal and was of a baroque monstrosity not often seen outside the Maximegalon Museum of Diseased Imaginings. An intestinal jumble of 
plumbing had been picked out in gold leaf rather than decently buried at midnight in an unmarked grave; the taps and shower attachment would have made a gargoyle jump. 
As the dominant centrepiece of a starship bridge it was terribly wrong, and it was with the embittered air of a man who knew this that Number Two approached it. 
"Captain, sir!" he shouted through clenched teeth a difficult trick but he'd had years during which to perfect it. 
A large genial face and a genial foam covered arm popped up above the rim of the monstrous bath. 
"Ah, hello, Number Two," said the Captain, waving a cheery sponge, "having a nice day?" 
Number Two snapped even further to attention than he already was. 
"I have brought you the prisoners I located in freezer bay seven, sir!" he yapped. 
Ford and Arthur coughed in confusion. 
"Er... hello," they said. 
The Captain beamed at them. So Number Two had really found some prisoners. Well, good for him, thought the Captain, nice to see a chap doing what he's best at. 
"Oh, hello there," he said to them, "Excuse me not getting up, having a quick bath. Well, jynnan tonnyx all round then. Look in the fridge Number one." 
"Certainly sir." 
It is a curious fact, and one to which no one knows quite how much importance to attach, that something like 85% of all known worlds in the Galaxy, be they primitive or highly advanced, have invented a drink called jynnan tonnyx, or gee-N'N-T'N-ix, or jinond-o-nicks, or any one of a thousand or more variations on the same phonetic theme. The drinks themselves are not the same, and vary between the Sivolvian "chinanto/mnigs" which is ordinary water server at slightly above room temperature, and the Gagrakackan "tzjin-anthony-ks" which kills cows at a hundred paces; and in fact the one common factor between all of them, beyond the fact that the names sound the same, is that they were all invented and named before the worlds concerned made contact with any other worlds. 
What can be made of this fact? It exists in total isolation. As far as any theory of structural linguistics is concerned it is right off the graph, and yet it persists. Old structural linguists get very angry when young structural linguists go on about it. Young structural linguists getâ¨deeply excited about it and stay up late at night convinced that they are very close to something of profound importance, and end up becoming old structural linguists before their time, getting very angry with the young ones. Structural linguistics is a bitterly divided and unhappy discipline, and a large number of its practitioners spend too many nights drowning their problems in Ouisghian Zodahs. 
Number Two stood before the Captain's bathtub trembling with frustration. 
"Don't you want to interrogate the prisoners sir?" he squealed. 
The Captain peered at him in bemusement. 
"Why on Golgafrincham should I want to do that?" he asked. 
"To get information out of them, sir! To find out why they came here!" 
"Oh no, no, no," said the Captain, "I expect they just dropped in for a quick jynnan tonnyx, don't you?" 
"But sir, they're my prisoners! I must interrogate them!" 
The Captain looked at them doubtfully. 
"Oh all right," he said, "if you must. Ask them what they want to drink." 
A hard cold gleam came into Number Two's eyes. He advanced slowly on Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent. 
"All right, you scum," he growled, "you vermin..." He jabbed Ford with the Kill-O-Zap gun. 
"Steady on, Number Two," admonished the Captain gently. 
"What do you want to drink?!!" Number Two screamed. 
"Well the jynnan tonnyx sounds very nice to me," said Ford, "What about you Arthur?" 
Arthur blinked.â¨"What? Oh, er, yes," he said.â¨"With ice or without?" bellowed Number Two. "Oh, with please," said Ford.â¨"Lemon??!!" 
"Yes please," said Ford, "and do you have any of those little biscuits? You know, the cheesy ones?" 
"I'm asking the questions!!!!" howled Number Two, his body quaking with apoplectic fury. 
"Er, Number Two..." said the Captain softly. 
"Sir?!" 
"Push off, would you, there's a good chap. I'm trying to have a relaxing bath." 
Number Two's eyes narrowed and became what are known in the Shouting and Killing People trade as cold slits, the idea presumably being to give your opponent the impression that you have lost your glasses or are having difficulty keeping awake. Why this is frightening is an, as yet, unresolved problem. 
He advanced on the captain, his (Number Two's) mouth a thin hard line. Again, tricky to know why this is understood as fighting behaviour. If, whilst wandering through the jungle of Traal, you were suddenly to come upon the fabled Ravenous Bugblatter Beast, you would have reason to be grateful if its mouth was a thin hard line rather than, as it usually is, a gaping mass of slavering fangs. 
"May I remind you sir," hissed Number Two at the Captain, "that you have now been in that bath for over three years?!" This final shot delivered, Number Two spun on his heel and stalked off to a corner to practise darting eye movements in the mirror. 
The Captain squirmed in his bath. He gave Ford Prefect a lame smile. 
"Well you need to relax a lot in a job like mine," he said. 
Ford slowly lowered his hands. It provoked no reaction. Arthur lowered his. 
Treading very slowly and carefully, Ford moved over to the bath pedestal. He patted it. 
"Nice," he lied. 
He wondered if it was safe to grin. Very slowly and carefully, he grinned. It was safe. 
"Er..." he said to the Captain. "Yes?" said the Captain. 
"I wonder," said Ford, "could I ask you actually what your job is in fact?" 
A hand tapped him on the shoulder. He span round. It was the first officer.â¨"Your drinks," he said. 
"Ah, thank you," said Ford. He and Arthur took their jynnan tonnyx. Arthur sipped his, and was surprised to discover it tasted very like a whisky and soda. 
"I mean, I couldn't help noticing," said Ford, also taking a sip, "the bodies. In the hold." 
"Bodies?" said the Captain in surprise. 
Ford paused and thought to himself. Never take anything for granted, he thought. Could it be that the Captain doesn't know he's got fifteen million dead bodies on his ship? 
The Captain was nodding cheerfully at him. He also appeared to be playing with a rubber duck. 
Ford looked around. Number Two was staring at him in the mirror, but only for an instant: his eyes were constantly on the move. The first officer was just standing there holding the drinks tray and smiling benignly. 
"Bodies?" said the Captain again. 
Ford licked his lips. 
"Yes," he said, "All those dead telephone sanitizers and account executives, you know, down in the hold." 
The Captain stared at him. Suddenly he threw back his head and laughed. 
"Oh they're not dead," he said, "Good Lord no, no they're frozen. They're going to be revived." 
Ford did something he very rarely did. He blinked.â¨Arthur seemed to come out of a trance.â¨"You mean you've got a hold full of frozen hairdressers?" he said. 
"Oh yes," said the Captain, "Millions of them. Hairdressers, tired TV producers, insurance salesmen, personnel officers, security guards, public relations executives, management consultants, you name them. We're going to colonize another planet." 
Ford wobbled very slightly. 
"Exciting isn't it?" said the Captain. 
"What, with that lot?" said Arthur. 
"Ah, now don't misunderstand me," said the Captain, "we're just one of the ships in the Ark Fleet. We're the 'B' Ark you see. Sorry, could I just ask you to run a bit more hot water for me?" 
Arthur obliged, and a cascade of pink frothy water swirled around the bath. The Captain let out a sigh of pleasure. 
"Thank you so much my dear fellow. Do help yourselves to more drinks of course." 
Ford tossed down his drink, took the bottle from the first officer's tray and refilled his glass to the top. 
"What," he said, "is a 'B' Ark?" 
"This is," said the Captain, and swished the foamy water around joyfully with the duck. 
"Yes," said Ford, "but..." 
"Well what happened you see was," said the Captain, "our planet, the world from which we have come, was, so to speak, doomed." 
"Doomed?" 
"Oh yes. So what everyone thought was, let's pack the whole population into some giant spaceships and go and settle on another planet." 
Having told this much of his story, he settled back with a satisfied grunt. 
"You mean a less doomed one?" promoted Arthur. 
"What did you say dear fellow?" 
"A less doomed planet. You were going to settle on." 
"Are going to settle on, yes. So it was decided to build three ships, you see, three Arks in Space, and... I'm not boring you am I?" 
"No, no," said Ford firmly, "it's fascinating." 
"You know it's delightful," reflected the Captain, "to have someone else to talk to for a change." 
Number Two's eyes darted feverishly about the room again and then settled back on the mirror, like a pair of flies briefly distracted from their favourite prey of months old meat. 
"Trouble with a long journey like this," continued the Captain, "is that you end up just talking to yourself a lot, which gets terribly 
boring because half the time you know what you're going to say next." 
"Only half the time?" asked Arthur in surprise. 
The Captain thought for a moment. 
"Yes, about half I'd say. Anyway where's the soap?" He fished around and found it. 
"Yes, so anyway," he resumed, "the idea was that into the first ship, the 'A' ship, would go all the brilliant leaders, the scientists, the great artists, you know, all the achievers; and into the third, or 'C' ship, would go all the people who did the actual work, who made things and did things, and then into the 'B' ship that's us would go everyone else, the middlemen you see." 
He smiled happily at them. 
"And we were sent off first," he concluded, and hummed a little bathing tune. 
The little bathing tune, which had been composed for him by one of his world's most exciting and prolific jingle writer (who was currently asleep in hold thirty-six some nine hundred yards behind them) covered what would otherwise have been an awkward moment of silence. Ford and Arthur shuffled their feet and furiously avoided each other's eyes. 
"Er..." said Arthur after a moment, "what exactly was it that was wrong with your planet then?" 
"Oh, it was doomed, as I said," said the Captain, "Apparently it was going to crash into the sun or something. Or maybe it was that the moon was going to crash into us. Something of the kind. Absolutely terrifying prospect whatever it was." 
"Oh," said the first officer suddenly, "I thought it was that the planet was going to be invaded by a gigantic swarm of twelve foot piranha bees. Wasn't that it?" 
Number Two span around, eyes ablaze with a cold hard light that only comes with the amount of practise he was prepared to put in. 
"That's not what I was told!" he hissed, "My commanding officer told me that the entire planet was in imminent danger of being eaten by an enormous mutant star goat!" 
"Oh really..." said Ford Prefect. 
"Yes! A monstrous creature from the pit of hell with scything teeth ten thousand miles long, breath that would boil oceans, claws that could tear continents from their roots, a thousand eyes that burned like the sun, slavering jaws a million miles across, a monster such as you have never... never... ever..." 
"And they made sure they sent you lot off first did they?" inquired Arthur. 
"Oh yes," said the Captain, "well everyone said, very nicely I thought, that it was very important for morale to feel that they would be arriving on a planet where they could be sure of a good haircut and where the phones were clean." 
"Oh yes," agreed Ford, "I can see that would be very important. And the other ships, er... they followed on after you did they?" 
For a moment the Captain did not answer. He twisted round in his bath and gazed backwards over the huge bulk of the ship towards the bright galactic centre. He squinted into the inconceivable distance. 
"Ah. Well it's funny you should say that," he said and allowed himself a slight frown at Ford Prefect, "because curiously enough we haven't heard a peep out of them since we left five years ago... but they must be behind us somewhere." 
He peered off into the distance again.â¨Ford peered with him and gave a thoughtful frown.â¨"Unless of course," he said softly, "they were eaten by the goat..." 
"Ah yes..." said the Captain with a slight hesitancy creeping into his voice, "the goat..." His eyes passed over the solid shapes of the instruments and computers that lined the bridge. They winked away innocently at him. He stared out at the stars, but none of them said a word. He glanced at his first and second officers, but they seemed lost in their own thoughts for a moment. He glanced at Ford Prefect who raised his eyebrows at him. 
"It's a funny thing you know," said the Captain at last, "but now that I actually come to tell the story to someone else... I mean does it strike you as odd Number Two?" 
"Errrrrrrrrrrr..." said Number Two. 
"Well," said Ford, "I can see that you've got a lot of things you're going to talk about, so, thanks for the drinks, and if you could sort of drop us off at the nearest convenient planet..." 
"Ah, well that's a little difficult you see," said the Captain, "because our trajectory thingy was preset before we left Golgafrincham, I think partly because I'm not very good with figures..." 
"You mean we're stuck here on this ship?" exclaimed Ford suddenly losing patience with the whole charade, "When are you meant to be reaching this planet you're meant to be colonizing?" 
"Oh, we're nearly there I think," said the Captain, "any second now. It's probably time I was getting out of this bath in fact. Oh, I don't know though, why stop just when I'm enjoying it?" 
"So we're actually going to land in a minute?"â¨"Well not so much land, in fact, not actually land as such, no... er..." "What are you talking about?" said Ford sharply. 
"Well," said the Captain, picking his way through the words carefully, "I think as far as I can remember we were programmed to crash on it." 
"Crash?" shouted Ford and Arthur. 
"Er, yes," said the Captain, "yes, it's all part of the plan I think. There was a terribly good reason for it which I can't quite remember at the moment. It was something to with... er..." 
Ford exploded.â¨"You're a load of useless bloody loonies!" he shouted.â¨"Ah yes, that was it," beamed the Captain, "that was the reason." 
Chapter 25 
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has this to say about the planet of Golgafrincham: It is a planet with an ancient and mysterious history, rich in legend, red, and occasionally green with the blood of those who sought in times gone by to conquer her; a land of parched and barren landscapes, of sweet and sultry air heady with the scent of the perfumed springs that trickle over its hot and dusty rocks and nourish the dark and musty lichens beneath; a land of fevered brows and intoxicated imaginings, particularly amongst those who taste the lichens; a land also of cool and shaded thoughts amongst those who have learnt to forswear the lichens and find a tree to sit beneath; a land also of steel and blood and heroism; a land of the body and of the spirit. This was its history. 
And in all this ancient and mysterious history, the most mysterious figures of all were without doubt those of the Great Circling Poets of Arium. These Circling Poets used to live in remote mountain passes where they would lie in wait for small bands of unwary travellers, circle round them, and throw rocks at them. 
And when the travellers cried out, saying why didn't they go away and get on with writing some poems instead of pestering people with all this rock-throwing business, they would suddenly stop, and then break into one of the seven hundred and ninety-four great Song Cycles of Vassilian. These songs were all of extraordinary beauty, and even more extraordinary length, and all fell into exactly the same pattern. 
The first part of each song would tell how there once went forth from the City of Vassilian a party of five sage princes with four horses. The princes, who are of course brave, noble and wise, travel widely in distant lands, fought giant ogres, pursue exotic philosophies, take tea with weird gods and rescue beautiful monsters from ravening princesses before finally announcing that they have achieved enlightenment and that their wanderings are therefore accomplished. 
The second, and much longer, part of each song would then tell of all their bickerings about which one of them is going to have to walk back. 
All this lay in the planet's remote past. It was, however, a descendant of one of these eccentric poets who invented the spurious tales of impending doom which enabled the people of Golgafrincham to rid themselves of an entire useless third of their population. The other two-thirds stayed firmly at home and lived full, rich and happy lives until they were all suddenly wiped out by a virulent disease contracted from a dirty telephone. 
Chapter 26 
That night the ship crash-landed on to an utterly insignificant little green-blue planet which circled a small unregarded yellow sun in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the Western spiral arm of the Galaxy. 
In the hours preceding the crash Ford Prefect had fought furiously but in vain to unlock the controls of the ship from their pre-ordained flight path. It had quickly become apparent to him that the ship had been programmed to convey its payload safely, in uncomfortably, to its new home but to cripple itself beyond repair in the process. 
Its screaming, blazing descent through the atmosphere had stripped away most of its superstructure and outer shielding, and its final inglorious bellyflop into a murky swamp had left its crew only a few hours of darkness during which to revive and offload its deep- frozen and unwanted cargo for the ship began to settle almost at once, slowly upending its gigantic bulk in the stagnant slime. Once or twice during the night it was starkly silhouetted against the sky as burning meteors the detritus of its descent flashed across the sky. 
In the grey pre-dawn light it let out an obscene roaring gurgle and sank for ever into the stinking depths. 
When the sun came up that morning it shed its thin watery light over a vast area heaving with wailing hairdressers, public relations executives, opinion pollsters and the rest, all clawing their way desperately to dry land. 
A less strong minded sun would probably have gone straight back down again, but it continued to climb its way through the sky and after a while the influence of its warming rays began to have some restoring effect on the feebly struggling creatures. 
Countless numbers had, unsurprisingly, been lost to the swamp in the night, and millions more had been sucked down with the ship, but those that survived still numbered hundreds of thousands and as the day wore on they crawled out over the surrounding countryside, each 
looking for a few square feet of solid ground on which to collapse and recover from their nightmare ordeal. 
Two figures moved further afield. 
From a nearby hillside Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent watched the horror of which they could not feel a part. 
"Filthy dirty trick to pull," muttered Arthur. 
Ford scraped a stick along the ground and shrugged. 
"An imaginative solution to a problem I'd have thought," he said. 
"Why can't people just learn to live together in peace and harmony?" said Arthur. 
Ford gave a loud, very hollow laugh. 
"Forty-two!" he said with a malicious grin, "No, doesn't work. Never mind." 
Arthur looked at him as if he'd gone mad and, seeing nothing to indicate the contrary, realized that it would be perfectly reasonable to assume that this had in fact happened. 
"What do you think will happen to them all?" he said after a while. 
"In an infinite Universe anything can happen," said Ford, "Even survival. Strange but true." 
A curious look came into his eyes as they passed over the landscape and then settles again on the scene of misery below them. 
"I think they'll manage for a while," he said. Arthur looked up sharply.â¨"Why do you say that?" he said.â¨Ford shrugged. 
"Just a hunch," he said, and refused to be drawn to any further questions. 
"Look," he said suddenly. 
Arthur followed his pointing finger. Down amongst the sprawling masses a figure was moving or perhaps lurching would be a more accurate description. He appeared to be carrying something on his shoulder. As he lurched from prostrate form to prostrate form he seemed to wave whatever the something was at them in a drunken fashion. After a while he gave up the struggle and collapsed in a heap. 
Arthur had no idea what this was meant to mean to him. 
"Movie camera," said Ford. "Recording the historic movement." 
"Well, I don't know about you," said Ford again after a moment, "but I'm off." 
He sat a while in silence. 
After a while this seemed to require comment. 
"Er, when you say you're off, what do you mean exactly?" said Arthur. 
"Good question," said Ford, "I'm getting total silence." 
Looking over his shoulder Arthur saw that he was twiddling with knobs on a small box. Ford had already introduced this box as a Sub- Etha Sens-O-Matic, but Arthur had merely nodded absently and not pursued the matter. In his mind the Universe still divided into two parts the Earth, and everything else. The Earth having been demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass meant that this view of things was a little lopsided, but Arthur tended to cling to that lopsidedness as being his last remaining contact with his home. Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matics belonged firmly in the "everything else" category. 
"Not a sausage," said Ford, shaking the thing. 
Sausage, thought Arthur to himself as he gazed listlessly at the primitive world about him, what I wouldn't give for a good Earth sausage. 
"Would you believe," said Ford in exasperation, "that there are no transmissions of any kind within light years of this benighted tip? Are you listening to me?" 
"What?" said Arthur.â¨"We're in trouble," said Ford.â¨"Oh," said Arthur. This sounded like month-old news to him. 
"Until we pick up anything on this machine," said Ford, "our chances of getting off this planet are zero. It may be some freak standing wave effect in the planet's magnetic field in which case we just travel round and round till we find a clear reception area. Coming?" 
He picked up his gear and strode off. 
Arthur looked down the hill. The man with the movie camera had struggled back up to his feet just in time to film one of his colleagues collapsing. 
Arthur picked a blade of grass and strode off after Ford. 
Chapter 27 
"I trust you had a pleasant meal?" said Zarniwoop to Zaphod and Trillian as they rematerialized on the bridge of the starship Heart of Gold and lay panting on the floor. 
Zaphod opened some eyes and glowered at him. 
"You," he spat. He staggered to his feet and stomped off to find a chair to slump into. He found one and slumped into it. 
"I have programmed the computer with the Improbability Coordinates pertinent to our journey," said Zarniwoop, "we will arrive there very shortly. Meanwhile, why don't you relax and prepare yourself for the meeting?" 
Zaphod said nothing. He got up again and marched over to a small cabinet from which he pulled a bottle of old Janx spirit. He took a long pull at it. 
"And when this is all done," said Zaphod savagely, "it's done, alright? I'm free to go and do what the hell I like and lie on beaches andâ¨stuff?" 
"It depends what transpires from the meeting," said Zarniwoop. 
"Zaphod, who is this man?" said Trillian shakily, wobbling to her feet, "What's he doing here? Why's he on our ship?" 
"He's a very stupid man," said Zaphod, "who wants to meet the man who rules the Universe." 
"Ah," said Trillian taking the bottle from Zaphod and helping herself, "a social climber." 
Chapter 28 
The major problem one of the major problems, for there are several one of the many major problems with governing people is that of whom you get to do it; or rather of who manages to get people to let them do it to them. 
To summarize: it is a well known fact, that those people who most want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it. To summarize the summary: anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job. To summarize the summary of the summary: people are a problem. 
And so this is the situation we find: a succession of Galactic Presidents who so much enjoy the fun and palaver of being in power that they very rarely notice that they're not. 
And somewhere in the shadows behind them who? 
Who can possibly rule if no one who wants to do it can be allowed to? 
Chapter 29 
On a small obscure world somewhere in the middle of nowhere in particular nowhere, that is, that could ever be found, since it is protected by a vast field of unprobability to which only six men in this galaxy have a key it was raining. 
It was bucketing down, and had been for hours. It beat the top of the sea into a mist, it pounded the trees, it churned and slopped a stretch of scrubby land near the sea into a mudbath. 
The rain pelted and danced on the corrugated iron roof of the small shack that stood in the middle of this patch of scrubby land. It obliterated the small rough pathway that led from the shack down to the seashore and smashed apart the neat piles of interesting shells which had been placed there. 
The noise of the rain on the roof of the shack was deafening within, but went largely unnoticed by its occupant, whose attention was otherwise engaged. 
He was a tall shambling man with rough straw-coloured hair that was damp from the leaking roof. His clothes were shabby, his back was hunched, and his eyes, though open, seemed closed. 
In his shack was an old beaten-up armchair, an old scratched table, an old mattress, some cushions and a stove that was small but warm. 
There was also an old and slightly weatherbeaten cat, and this was currently the focus of the man's attention. He bent his shambling form over it. 
"Pussy, pussy, pussy," he said, "coochicoochicoochicoo... pussy want his fish? Nice piece of fish... pussy want it?" 
The cat seemed undecided on the matter. It pawed rather condescendingly at the piece of fish the man was holding out, and then got distracted by a piece of dust on the floor. 
"Pussy not eat his fish, pussy get thin and waste away, I think," said the man. Doubt crept into his voice. 
"I imagine this is what will happen," he said, "but how can I tell?" 
He proffered the fish again. 
"Pussy think," he said, "eat fish or not eat fish. I think it is better if I don't get involved." He sighed. 
"I think fish is nice, but then I think that rain is wet, so who am I to judge?" 
He left the fish on the floor for the cat, and retired to his seat. 
"Ah, I seem to see you eating it," he said at last, as the cat exhausted the entertainment possibilities of the speck of dust and pounced on to the fish. 
"I like it when I see you eat the fish," said the man, "because in my mind you will waste away if you don't." 
He picked up from the table a piece of paper and the stub of a pencil. He held one in one hand and the other in the other, and experimented with the different ways of bringing them together. He tried holding the pencil under the paper, then over the paper, then next to the paper. He tried wrapping the paper round the pencil, he tried rubbing the stubby end of the pencil against the paper and then he tried rubbing the sharp end of the pencil against the paper. It made a mark, and he was delighted with the discovery, as he was every day. He picked up another piece of paper from the table. This had a crossword on it. He studied it briefly and filled in a couple of clues before losing interest. 
He tried sitting on one of his hands and was intrigued by the feel of the bones of his hip. 
"Fish come from far away," he said, "or so I'm told. Or so I imagine I'm told. When the men come, or when in my mind the men come in their six black ships, do they come in your mind too? What do you see pussy?" 
He looked at the cat, which was more concerned with getting the fish down as rapidly as possible than it was with these speculations. 
"And when I hear their questions, do you hear questions? What do their voices mean to you? Perhaps you just think they're singing songs to you." He reflected on this, and saw the flaw in the supposition. 
"Perhaps they are singing songs to you," he said, "and I just think they're asking me questions." 
He paused again. Sometimes he would pause for days, just to see what it was like. 
"Do you think they came today?" he said, "I do. There's mud on the floor, cigarettes and whisky on the table, fish on a plate for you and a memory of them in my mind. Hardly conclusive evidence I know, but then all evidence is circumstantial. And look what else they've left me." 
He reached over to the table and pulled some things off it. 
"Crosswords, dictionaries, and a calculator." 
He played with the calculator for an hour, whilst the cat went to sleep and the rain outside continued to pour. Eventually he put the calculator aside. 
"I think I must be right in thinking they ask me questions," he said, "To come all that way and leave all these things for the privilege of singing songs to you would be very strange behaviour. Or so it seems to me. Who can tell, who can tell." 
From the table he picked up a cigarette and lit it with a spill from the stove. He inhaled deeply and sat back. 
"I think I saw another ship in the sky today," he said at last. "A big white one. I've never seen a big white one, just the six black ones. And the six green ones. And the others who say they come from so far away. Never a big white one. Perhaps six small black ones can look like one big white one at certain times. Perhaps I would like a glass of whisky. Yes, that seems more likely." 
He stood up and found a glass that was lying on the floor by the mattress. He poured in a measure from his whisky bottle. He sat again. 
"Perhaps some other people are coming to see me," he said. 
A hundred yards away, pelted by the torrential rain, lay the Heart of Gold. 
Its hatchway opened, and three figures emerged, huddling into themselves to keep the rain off their faces. 
"In there?" shouted Trillian above the noise of the rain. "Yes," said Zarniwoop.â¨"That shack?"â¨"Yes." 
"Weird," said Zaphod. 
"But it's in the middle of nowhere," said Trillian, "we must have come to the wrong place. You can't rule the Universe from a shack." 
They hurried through the pouring rain, and arrived, wet through, at the door. They knocked. They shivered. 
The door opened.â¨"Hello?" said the man.â¨"Ah, excuse me," said Zarniwoop, "I have reason to believe..." "Do you rule the Universe?" said Zaphod.â¨The man smiled at him.â¨"I try not to," he said, "Are you wet?"â¨Zaphod looked at him in astonishment.â¨"Wet?" he cried, "Doesn't it look as if we're wet?" 
"That's how it looks to me," said the man, "but how you feel about it might be an altogether different matter. If you feel warmth makes you dry, you'd better come in." 
They went in. 
They looked around the tiny shack, Zarniwoop with slight distaste, Trillian with interest, Zaphod with delight. 
"Hey, er..." said Zaphod, "what's your name?" 
The man looked at them doubtfully. 
"I don't know. Why, do you think I should have one? It seems very odd to give a bundle of vague sensory perceptions a name." 
He invited Trillian to sit in the chair. He sat on the edge of the chair, Zarniwoop leaned stiffly against the table and Zaphod lay on the mattress. 
"Wowee!" said Zaphod, "the seat of power!" He tickled the cat. "Listen," said Zarniwoop, "I must ask you some questions." "Alright," said the man kindly, "you can sing to my cat if you like." "Would he like that?" asked Zaphod. 
"You'd better ask him," said the man. 
"Does he talk?" said Zaphod. 
"I have no memory of him talking," said the man, "but I am very unreliable." 
Zarniwoop pulled some notes out of a pocket. "Now," he said, "you do rule the Universe, do you?" 
"How can I tell?" said the man. 
Zarniwoop ticked off a note on the paper. 
"How long have you been doing this?" 
"Ah," said the man, "this is a question about the past is it?" 
Zarniwoop looked at him in puzzlement. This wasn't exactly what he had been expecting. 
"Yes," he said. 
"How can I tell," said the man, "that the past isn't a fiction designed to account for the discrepancy between my immediate physical sensations and my state of mind?" 
Zarniwoop stared at him. The steam began to rise from his sodden clothes. 
"So you answer all questions like this?" he said. 
The man answered quickly. 
"I say what it occurs to me to say when I think I hear people say things. More I cannot say." 
Zaphod laughed happily. 
"I'll drink to that," he said and pulled out the bottle of Janx spirit. He leaped up and handed the bottle to the ruler of the Universe, who took it with pleasure. 
"Good on you, great ruler," he said, "tell it like it is." 
"No, listen to me," said Zarniwoop, "people come to you do they? In ships..." 
"I think so," said the man. He handed the bottle to Trillian. 
"And they ask you," said Zarniwoop, "to take decisions for them? About people's lives, about worlds, about economies, about wars, about everything going on out there in the Universe?" 
"Out there?" said the man, "out where?" 
"Out there!" said Zarniwoop pointing at the door. 
"How can you tell there's anything out there," said the man politely, "the door's closed." 
The rain continued to pound the roof. Inside the shack it was warm. 
"But you know there's a whole Universe out there!" cried Zarniwoop. "You can't dodge your responsibilities by saying they don't exist!" 
The ruler of the Universe thought for a long while whilst Zarniwoop quivered with anger. 
"You're very sure of your facts," he said at last, "I couldn't trust the thinking of a man who takes the Universe if there is one for granted." 
Zarniwoop still quivered, but was silent. 
"I only decide about my Universe," continued the man quietly. "My Universe is my eyes and my ears. Anything else is hearsay." 
"But don't you believe in anything?"â¨The man shrugged and picked up his cat.â¨"I don't understand what you mean," he said. 
"You don't understand that what you decide in this shack of yours affects the lives and fates of millions of people? This is all monstrously wrong!" 
"I don't know. I've never met all these people you speak of. And neither, I suspect, have you. They only exist in words we hear. It is folly to say you know what is happening to other people. Only they know, if they exist. They have their own Universes of their own eyes and ears." 
Trillian said:â¨"I think I'm just popping outside for a moment."â¨She left and walked into the rain.â¨"Do you believe other people exist?" insisted Zarniwoop.â¨"I have no opinion. How can I say?"â¨"I'd better see what's up with Trillian," said Zaphod and slipped out. Outside, he said to her:â¨"I think the Universe is in pretty good hands, yeah?"â¨"Very good," said Trillian. They walked off into the rain.â¨Inside, Zarniwoop continued.â¨"But don't you understand that people live or die on your word?" 
The ruler of the Universe waited for as long as he could. When he heard the faint sound of the ship's engines starting he spoke to cover it. 
"It's nothing to do with me," he said, "I am not involved with people. The Lord knows I am not a cruel man." 
"Ah!" barked Zarniwoop, "you say 'The Lord'. You believe in something!" 
"My cat," said the man benignly, picking it up and stroking it, "I call him The Lord. I am kind to him." 
"Alright," said Zarniwoop, pressing home his point, "How do you know he exists? How do you know he knows you to be kind, or enjoys what he thinks of as your kindness?" 
"I don't," said the man with a smile, "I have no idea. It merely pleases me to behave in a certain way to what appears to be a cat. Do you behave any differently? Please, I think I am tired." 
Zarniwoop heaved a thoroughly dissatisfied sigh and looked about. 
"Where are the other two?" he said suddenly. 
"What other two?" said the ruler of the Universe, settling back into his chair and refilling his whisky glass. 
"Beeblebrox and the girl! The two who were here!" 
"I remember no one. The past is a fiction to account for..." 
"Stuff it," snapped Zarniwoop and ran out into the rain. There was no ship. The rain continued to churn the mud. There was no sign to show where the ship had been. He hollered into the rain. He turned and ran back to the shack and found it locked. 
The ruler of the Universe dozed lightly in his chair. After a while he played with the pencil and the paper again and was delighted when he discovered how to make a mark with the one on the other. Various noises continued outside, but he didn't know whether they were real or not. He then talked to his table for a week to see how it would react. 
Chapter 30 
The stars came out that night, dazzling in their brilliance and clarity. Ford and Arthur had walked more miles than they had any means of judging and finally stopped to rest. The night was cool and balmy, the air pure, the Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic totally silent. 
A wonderful stillness hung over the world, a magical calm which combined with the soft fragrances of the woods, the quiet chatter of insects and the brilliant light of the stars to soothe their jangled spirits. Even Ford Prefect, who had seen more worlds than he could count on a long afternoon, was moved to wonder if this was the most beautiful he had ever seen. All that day they had passed through rolling green hills and valleys, richly covered with grasses, wild scented flowers and tall thickly leaved trees, the sun had warmed them, light breezes had kept them cool, and Ford Prefect had checked his Sub-Etha Sens-O- Matic at less and less frequent intervals, and had exhibited less and less annoyance at its continued silence. He was beginning to think he liked it here. 
Cool though the night air was they slept soundly and comfortably in the open and awoke a few hours later with the light dewfall feeling refreshed but hungry. Ford had stuffed some small rolls into his satchel at Milliways and they breakfasted off those before moving on. 
So far they had wandered purely at random, but now they struck out firmly eastwards, feeling that if they were going to explore this world they should have some clear idea of where they had come from and where they were going. 
Shortly before noon they had their first indication that the world they had landed on was not an uninhabited one: a half glimpsed face amongst the trees, watching them. It vanished at the moment they both saw it, but the image they were both left with was of a humanoid creature, curious to see them but not alarmed. Half an hour later they glimpsed another such face, and ten minutes after that another. 
A minute later they stumbled into a wide clearing and stopped short. 
Before them in the middle of the clearing stood a group of about two dozen men and women. They stood still and quiet facing Ford and Arthur. Around some of the women huddled some small children and behind the group was a ramshackle array of small dwellings made of mud and branches. 
Ford and Arthur held their breath. 
The tallest of the men stood a little over five feet high, they all stooped forward slightly, had longish arms and lowish foreheads, and clear bright eyes with which they stared intently at the strangers. 
Seeing that they carried no weapons and made no move towards them, Ford and Arthur relaxed slightly. 
For a while the two groups simply stared at each other, neither side making any move. The natives seemed puzzled by the intruders, and whilst they showed no sign of aggression they were quite clearly not issuing any invitations. 
For a full two minutes nothing continued to happen.â¨After two minutes Ford decided it was time something happened. "Hello," he said.â¨The women drew their children slightly closer to them. 
The men made hardly any discernible move and yet their whole disposition made it clear that the greeting was not welcome it was not resented in any great degree, it was just not welcome. 
One of the men, who had been standing slightly forward of the rest of the group and who might therefore have been their leader, stepped forward. His face was quiet and calm, almost serene. 
"Ugghhhuuggghhhrrrr uh uh ruh uurgh," he said quietly. 
This caught Arthur by surprise. He had grown so used to receiving an instantaneous and unconscious translation of everything he heard via the Babel Fish lodged in his ear that he had ceased to be aware of it, and he was only reminded of its presence now by the fact that it didn't seem to be working. Vague shadows of meaning had flickered at the back of his mind, but there was nothing he could get any firm grasp on. He guessed, correctly as it happens, that these people had as yet evolved no more than the barest rudiments of language, and 
that the Babel Fish was therefore powerless to help. He glanced at Ford, who was infinitely more experienced in these matters. 
"I think," said Ford out of the corner of his mouth, "he's asking us if we'd mind walking on round the edge of the village." 
A moment later, a gesture from the man-creature seemed to confirm this. 
"Ruurgggghhhh urrgggh; urgh urgh (uh ruh) rruurruuh ug," continued the man-creature. 
"The general gist," said Ford, "as far as I can make out, is that we are welcome to continue our journey in any way we like, but if we would walk round his village rather than through it would make them all very happy." 
"So what do we do?" 
"I think we make them happy," said Ford. 
Slowly and watchfully they walked round the perimeter of the clearing. This seemed to go down very well with the natives who bowed to them very slightly and then went about their business. 
Ford and Arthur continued their journey through the wood. A few hundred yards past the clearing they suddenly came upon a small pile of fruit lying in their path berries that looked remarkably like raspberries and blackberries, and pulpy, green skinned fruit that looked remarkably like pears. 
So far they had steered clear of the fruit and berries they had seen, though the trees and bushed were laden with them. 
"Look at it this way," Ford Prefect had said, "fruit and berries on strange planets either make you live or make you die. Therefore the point at which to start toying with them is when you're going to die if you don't. That way you stay ahead. The secret of healthy hitch-hiking is to eat junk food." 
They looked at the pile that lay in their path with suspicion. It looked so good it made them almost dizzy with hunger. 
"Look at it this way," said Ford, "er..." 
"Yes?" said Arthur. 
"I'm trying to think of a way of looking at it which means we get to eat it," said Ford. 
The leaf-dappled sun gleamed on the pulp skins of the things which looked like pears. The things which looked like raspberries and strawberries were fatter and riper than any Arthur had ever seen, even in ice cream commercials. 
"Why don't we eat them and think about it afterwards?" he said. "Maybe that's what they want us to do."â¨"Alright, look at it this way..."â¨"Sounds good so far." 
"It's there for us to eat. Either it's good or it's bad, either they want to feed us or to poison us. If it's poisonous and we don't eat it they'll just attack us some other way. If we don't eat, we lose out either way." 
"I like the way you're thinking," said Ford, "Now eat one." 
Hesitantly, Arthur picked up one of those things that looked like pears. 
"I always thought that about the Garden of Eden story," said Ford. "Eh?"â¨"Garden of Eden. Tree. Apple. That bit, remember?"â¨"Yes of course I do." 
"Your God person puts an apple tree in the middle of a garden and says do what you like guys, oh, but don't eat the apple. Surprise surprise, they eat it and he leaps out from behind a bush shouting 'Gotcha'. It wouldn't have made any difference if they hadn't eaten it." 
"Why not?" 
"Because if you're dealing with somebody who has the sort of mentality which likes leaving hats on the pavement with bricks under them you know perfectly well they won't give up. They'll get you in the end." 
"What are you talking about?"â¨"Never mind, eat the fruit."â¨"You know, this place almost looks like the Garden of Eden." "Eat the fruit."â¨"Sounds quite like it too."â¨Arthur took a bite from the thing which looked like a pear. 
"It's a pear," he said. 
A few moments later, when they had eaten the lot, Ford Prefect turned round and called out. 
"Thank you. Thank you very much," he called, "you're very kind." They went on their way. 
For the next fifty miles of their journey eastward they kept on finding the occasional gift of fruit lying in their path, and though they once or twice had a quick glimpse of a native man-creature amongst the trees, they never again made direct contact. They decided they rather liked a race of people who made it clear that they were grateful simply to be left alone. 
The fruit and berries stopped after fifty miles, because that was where the sea started. 
Having no pressing calls on their time they built a raft and crossed the sea. It was reasonably calm, only about sixty miles wide and they had a reasonably pleasant crossing, landing in a country that was at least as beautiful as the one they had left. 
Life was, in short, ridiculously easy and for a while at least they were able to cope with the problems of aimlessness and isolation by deciding to ignore them. When the craving for company became too great they would know where to find it, but for the moment they were happy to feel that the Golgafrinchans were hundreds of miles behind them. 
Nevertheless, Ford Prefect began to use his Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic more often again. Only once did he pick up a signal, but that was so faint and from such enormous distance that it depressed him more than the silence that had otherwise continued unbroken. 
On a whim they turned northwards. After weeks of travelling they came to another sea, built another raft and crossed it. This time it was harder going, the climate was getting colder. Arthur suspected a streak of masochism in Ford Prefect the increasing difficulty of the journey seemed to give him a sense of purpose that was otherwise lacking. He strode onwards relentlessly. 
Their journey northwards brought them into steep mountainous terrain of breathtaking sweep and beauty. The vast, jagged, snow 
covered peaks ravished their senses. The cold began to bite into their bones. 
They wrapped themselves in animal skins and furs which Ford Prefect acquired by a technique he once learned from a couple of ex- Pralite monks running a Mind-Surfing resort in the Hills of Hunian. 
The galaxy is littered with ex-Pralite monks, all on the make, because the mental control techniques the Order have evolved as a form of devotional discipline are, frankly, sensational and extraordinary numbers of monks leave the Order just after they have finished their devotional training and just before they take their final vows to stay locked in small metal boxes for the rest of their lives. 
Ford's technique seemed to consist mainly of standing still for a while and smiling. 
After a while an animal a deer perhaps would appear from out of the trees and watch him cautiously. Ford would continue to smile at it, his eyes would soften and shine, and he would seem to radiate a deep and universal love, a love which reached out to embrace all of creation. A wonderful quietness would descend on the surrounding countryside, peaceful and serene, emanating from this transfigured man. Slowly the deer would approach, step by step, until it was almost nuzzling him, whereupon Ford Prefect would reach out to it and break its neck. 
"Pheromone control," he said it was, "you just have to know how to generate the right smell." 
Chapter 31 
A few days after landing in this mountainous land they hit a coastline which swept diagonally before them from the south-west to the north-east, a coastline of monumental grandeur: deep majestic ravines, soaring pinnacles of ice-fjords. 
For two further days they scrambled and climbed over the rocks and glaciers, awe-struck with beauty. 
"Arthur!" yelled Ford suddenly. 
It was the afternoon of the second day. Arthur was sitting on a high rock watching the thundering sea smashing itself against the craggy promontories. 
"Arthur!" yelled Ford again. 
Arthur looked to where Ford's voice had come from, carried faintly in the wind. 
Ford had gone to examine a glacier, and Arthur found him there crouching by the solid wall of blue ice. He was tense with excitement his eyes darted up to meet Arthur's. 
"Look," he said, "look!" 
Arthur looked. He saw the solid wall of blue ice. 
"Yes," he said, "it's a glacier. I've already seen it." 
"No," said Ford, "you've looked at it, you haven't seen it. Look!" 
Ford was pointing deep into the heart of the ice. 
Arthur peered he saw nothing but vague shadows. 
"Move back from it," insisted Ford, "look again." 
Arthur moved back and looked again. 
"No," he said, and shrugged. "What am I supposed to be looking for?" 
And suddenly he saw it. "You see it?"â¨He saw it. 
His mouth started to speak, but his brain decided it hadn't got anything to say yet and shut it again. His brain then started to contend with the problem of what his eyes told it they were looking at, but in doing so relinquished control of the mouth which promptly fell open again. Once more gathering up the jaw, his brain lost control of his left hand which then wandered around in an aimless fashion. For a second or so the brain tried to catch the left hand without letting go of the mouth and simultaneously tried to think about what was buried in the ice, which is probably why the legs went and Arthur dropped restfully to the ground. 
The thing that had been causing all this neural upset was a network of shadows in the ice, about eighteen inches beneath the surface. Looked at it from the right angle they resolved into the solid shapes of letters from an alien alphabet, each about three feet high; and for those, like Arthur, who couldn't read Magrathean there was above the letters the outline of a face hanging in the ice. 
It was an old face, thin and distinguished, careworn but not unkind. 
It was the face of the man who had won an award for designing the coastline they now knew themselves to be standing on. 
Chapter 32 
A thin whine filled the air. It whirled and howled through the trees upsetting the squirrels. A few birds flew off in disgust. The noise danced and skittered round the clearing. It whooped, it rasped, it generally offended. 
The Captain, however, regarded the lone bagpiper with an indulgent eye. Little could disturb his equanimity; indeed, once he had got over the loss of his gorgeous bath during that unpleasantness in the swamp all those months ago he had begun to find his new life remarkably congenial. A hollow had been scooped out of a large rock which stood in the middle of the clearing, and in this he would bask daily whilst attendants sloshed water over him. Not particularly warm water, it must be said, as they hadn't yet worked out a way of heating it. Never mind, that would come, and in the meantime search parties were scouring the countryside far and wide for a hot spring, preferably one in a nice leafy glade, and if it was near a soap mine perfection. To those who said that they had a feeling soap wasn't found in mines, the Captain had ventured to suggest that perhaps that was because no one had looked hard enough, and this possibility had been reluctantly acknowledged. 
No, life was very pleasant, and the greatest thing about it was that when the hot spring was found, complete with leafy glade en suite, and when in the fullness of time the cry came reverberating across the hills that the soap mine had been located and was producing five hundred cakes a day it would be more pleasant still. It was very important to have things to look forward to. 
Wail, wail, screech, wail, howl, honk, squeak went the bagpipes, increasing the Captain's already considerable pleasure at the thought that any moment now they might stop. That was something he looked forward to as well. 
What else was pleasant, he asked himself? Well, so many things: the red and gold of the trees, now that autumn was approaching; the peaceful chatter of scissors a few feet from his bath where a couple of 
hairdressers were exercising their skills on a dozing art director and his assistant; the sunlight gleaming off the six shiny telephones lined up along the edge of his rock-hewn bath. The only thing nicer than a phone that didn't ring all the time (or indeed at all) was six phones that didn't ring all the time (or indeed at all). 
Nicest of all was the happy murmur of all the hundreds of people slowly assembling in the clearing around him to watch the afternoon committee meeting. 
The Captain punched his rubber duck playfully on the beak. The afternoon committee meetings were his favourite. 
Other eyes watched the assembling crowds. High in a tree on the edge of the clearing squatted Ford Prefect, lately returned from foreign climes. After his six month journey he was lean and healthy, his eyes gleamed, he wore a reindeer-skin coat; his beard was as thick and his face as bronzed as a country-rock singer's. 
He and Arthur Dent had been watching the Golgafrinchans for almost a week now, and Ford had decided to stir things up a bit. 
The clearing was now full. Hundreds of men and women lounged around, chatting, eating fruit, playing cards and generally having a fairly relaxed time of it. Their track suits were now all dirty and even torn, but they all had immaculately styled hair. Ford was puzzled to see that many of them had stuffed their track suits full of leaves and wondered if this was meant to be some form of insulation against the coming winter. Ford's eyes narrowed. They couldn't be interested in botany of a sudden could they? 
In the middle of these speculations the Captain's voice rose above the hubbub. 
"Alright," he said, "I'd like to call this meeting to some sort of order if that's at all possible. Is that alright with everybody?" He smiled genially. "In a minute. When you're all ready." 
The talking gradually died away and the clearing fell silent, except for the bagpiper who seemed to be in some wild and uninhabitable musical world of his own. A few of those in his immediate vicinity threw some leaves to him. If there was any reason for this then it escaped Ford Prefect for the moment. 
A small group of people had clustered round the Captain and one of them was clearly beginning to speak. He did this by standing up, clearing his throat and then gazing off into the distance as if to signify to the crowd that he would be with them in a minute. 
The crowd of course were riveted and all turned their eyes on him. 
A moment of silence followed, which Ford judged to be the right dramatic moment to make his entry. The man turned to speak. 
Ford dropped down out of the tree. 
"Hi there," he said. 
The crowd swivelled round. 
"Ah my dear fellow," called out the Captain, "Got any matches on you? Or a lighter? Anything like that?" 
"No," said Ford, sounding a little deflated. It wasn't what he'd prepared. He decided he'd better be a little stronger on the subject. 
"No I haven't," he continued, "No matches. Instead I bring you news..." 
"Pity," said the Captain, "We've all run out you see. Haven't had a hot bath in weeks." 
Ford refused to be headed off. 
"I bring you news," he said, "of a discovery that might interest you." 
"Is it on the agenda?" snapped the man whom Ford had interrupted. 
Ford smiled a broad country-rock singer smile. 
"Now, come on," he said. 
"Well I'm sorry," said the man huffily, "but speaking as a management consultant of many years' standing, I must insist on the importance of observing the committee structure." 
Ford looked round the crowd. 
"He's mad you know," he said, "this is a prehistoric planet." 
"Address the chair!" snapped the management consultant. 
"There isn't chair," explained Ford, "there's only a rock." 
The management consultant decided that testiness was what the situation now called for. 
"Well, call it a chair," he said testily. 
"Why not call it a rock?" asked Ford. 
"You obviously have no conception," said the management consultant, not abandoning testiness in favour of good old fashioned hauteur, "of modern business methods." 
"And you have no conception of where you are," said Ford. A girl with a strident voice leapt to her feet and used it. "Shut up, you two," she said, "I want to table a motion." "You mean boulder a motion," tittered a hairdresser. "Order, order!" yapped the management consultant. 
"Alright," said Ford, "let's see how you are doing." He plonked himself down on the ground to see how long he could keep his temper. 
The Captain made a sort of conciliatory harrumphing noise. 
"I would like to call to order," he said pleasantly, "the five hundred and seventy-third meeting of the colonization committee of Fintlewoodlewix..." 
Ten seconds, thought Ford as he leapt to his feet again. 
"This is futile," he exclaimed, "five hundred and seventy-three committee meetings and you haven't even discovered fire yet!" 
"If you would care," said the girl with the strident voice, "to examine the agenda sheet..." 
"Agenda rock," trilled the hairdresser happily. 
"Thank you, I've made that point," muttered Ford. 
"... you... will... see..." continued the girl firmly, "that we are having a report from the hairdressers' Fire Development Sub-Committee today." 
"Oh... ah " said the hairdresser with a sheepish look which is recognized the whole Galaxy over as meaning "Er, will next Tuesday do?" 
"Alright," said Ford, rounding on him, "what have you done? What are you going to do? What are your thoughts on fire development?" 
"Well I don't know," said the hairdresser, "All they gave me was a couple of sticks..." 
"So what have you done with them?" 
Nervously, the hairdresser fished in his track suit top and handed over the fruits of his labour to Ford. 
Ford held them up for all to see. 
"Curling tongs," he said. 
The crowd applauded. 
"Never mind," said Ford, "Rome wasn't burnt in a day." 
The crowd hadn't the faintest idea what he was talking about, but they loved it nevertheless. They applauded. 
"Well, you're obviously being totally naive of course," said the girl, "When you've been in marketing as long as I have you'll know that before any new product can be developed it has to be properly researched. We've got to find out what people want from fire, how they relate to it, what sort of image it has for them." 
The crowd were tense. They were expecting something wonderful from Ford. 
"Stick it up your nose," he said. 
"Which is precisely the sort of thing we need to know," insisted the girl, "Do people want fire that can be applied nasally?" 
"Do you?" Ford asked the crowd. 
"Yes!" shouted some. 
"No!" shouted others happily. 
They didn't know, they just thought it was great. 
"And the wheel," said the Captain, "What about this wheel thingy? It sounds a terribly interesting project." 
"Ah," said the marketing girl, "Well, we're having a little difficulty there." 
"Difficulty?" exclaimed Ford, "Difficulty? What do you mean, difficulty? It's the single simplest machine in the entire Universe!" 
The marketing girl soured him with a look. 
"Alright, Mr. Wiseguy," she said, "you're so clever, you tell us what colour it should have." 
The crowd went wild. One up to the home team, they thought. Ford shrugged his shoulders and sat down again. 
"Almighty Zarquon," he said, "have none of you done anything?" 
As if in answer to his question there was a sudden clamour of noise from the entrance to the clearing. The crowd couldn't believe the amount of entertainment they were getting this afternoon: in marched a squad of about a dozen men dressed in the remnants of 
their Golgafrincham 3rd Regiment dress uniforms. About half of them still carried Kill-O-Zap guns, the rest now carried spears which they struck together as they marched. They looked bronzed, healthy, and utterly exhausted and bedraggled. They clattered to a halt and banged to attention. One of them fell over and never moved again. 
"Captain, sir!" cried Number Two for he was their leader "Permission to report sir!" 
"Yes, alright Number Two, welcome back and all that. Find any hot springs?" said the Captain despondently. 
"No sir!" 
"Thought you wouldn't." 
Number Two strode through the crowd and presented arms before the bath. 
"We have discovered another continent!" 
"When was this?" 
"It lies across the sea..." said Number Two, narrowing his eyes significantly, "to the east!" 
"Ah." 
Number Two turned to face the crowd. He raised his gun above his head. This is going to be great, thought the crowd. 
"We have declared war on it!" 
Wild abandoned cheering broke out in all corners of the clearing this was beyond all expectation. 
"Wait a minute," shouted Ford Prefect, "wait a minute!" 
He leapt to his feet and demanded silence. After a while he got it, or at least the best silence he could hope for under the circumstances: the circumstances were that the bagpiper was spontaneously composing a national anthem. 
"Do we have to have the piper?" demanded Ford. 
"Oh yes," said the Captain, "we've given him a grant." 
Ford considered opening this idea up for debate but quickly decided that that way madness lay. Instead he slung a well judged rock at the piper and turned to face Number Two. 
"War?" he said.â¨"Yes!" Number Two gazed contemptuously at Ford Prefect. "On the next continent?" 
"Yes! Total warfare! The war to end all wars!" "But there's no one even living there yet!"â¨Ah, interesting, thought the crowd, nice point. 
Number Two's gaze hovered undisturbed. In this respect his eyes were like a couple of mosquitos that hover purposefully three inches from your nose and refuse to be deflected by arm thrashes, fly swats or rolled newspapers. 
"I know that," he said, "but there will be one day! So we have left an open-ended ultimatum." 
"What?" 
"And blown up a few military installations." 
The Captain leaned forward out of his bath. 
"Military installations Number Two?" he said. 
For a moment the eyes wavered. 
"Yes sir, well potential military installations. Alright... trees." 
The moment of uncertainty passed his eyes flickered like whips over his audience. 
"And," he roared, "we interrogated a gazelle!" 
He flipped his Kill-O-Zap gun smartly under his arm and marched off through the pandemonium that had now erupted throughout the ecstatic crowd. A few steps was all he managed before he was caught up and carried shoulder high for a lap of honour round the clearing. 
Ford sat and idly tapped a couple of stones together. 
"So what else have you done?" he inquired after the celebrations had died down. 
"We have started a culture," said the marketing girl. 
"Oh yes?" said Ford. 
"Yes. One of our film producers is already making a fascinating documentary about the indigenous cavemen of the area." 
"They're not cavemen." "They look like cavemen." "Do they live in caves?" "Well..." 
"They live in huts." 
"Perhaps they're having their caves redecorated," called out a wag from the crowd. 
Ford rounded on him angrily. 
"Very funny," he said, "but have you noticed that they're dying out?" 
On their journey back, Ford and Arthur had come across two derelict villages and the bodies of many natives in the woods, where they had crept away to die. Those that still lived were stricken and listless, as if they were suffering some disease of the spirit rather than the body. They moved sluggishly and with an infinite sadness. Their future had been taken away from them. 
"Dying out!" repeated Ford. "Do you know what that means?" 
"Er... we shouldn't sell them any life insurance?" called out the wag again. 
Ford ignored him, and appealed to the whole crowd. 
"Can you try and understand," he said, "that it's just since we've arrived that they've started dying out!" 
"In fact that comes over terribly well in this film," said the marketing girl, "and just gives it that poignant twist which is the hallmark of the really great documentary. The producer's very committed." 
"He should be," muttered Ford. 
"I gather," said the girl, turning to address the Captain who was beginning to nod off, "that he wants to make one about you next, Captain." 
"Oh really?" he said, coming to with a start, "that's awfully nice." 
"He's got a very strong angle on it, you know, the burden of responsibility, the loneliness of command..." 
The Captain hummed and hahed about this for a moment. 
"Well, I wouldn't overstress that angle, you know," he said finally, "one's never alone with a rubber duck." 
He held the duck aloft and it got an appreciative round from the crowd. 
All the while, the Management Consultant had been sitting in stony silence, his finger tips pressed to his temples to indicate that he was waiting and would wait all day if it was necessary. 
At this point he decided he would not wait all day after all, he would merely pretend that the last half hour hadn't happened. 
He rose to his feet. 
"If," he said tersely, "we could for a moment move on to the subject of fiscal policy..." 
"Fiscal policy!" whooped Ford Prefect, "Fiscal policy!" 
The Management Consultant gave him a look that only a lungfish could have copied. 
"Fiscal policy..." he repeated, "that is what I said." 
"How can you have money," demanded Ford, "if none of you actually produces anything? It doesn't grow on trees you know." 
"If you would allow me to continue..." 
Ford nodded dejectedly. 
"Thank you. Since we decided a few weeks ago to adopt the leaf as legal tender, we have, of course, all become immensely rich." 
Ford stared in disbelief at the crowd who were murmuring appreciatively at this and greedily fingering the wads of leaves with which their track suits were stuffed. 
"But we have also," continued the Management Consultant, "run into a small inflation problem on account of the high level of leaf availability, which means that, I gather, the current going rate has something like three deciduous forests buying one ship's peanut." 
Murmurs of alarm came from the crowd. The Management Consultant waved them down. 
"So in order to obviate this problem," he continued, "and effectively revaluate the leaf, we are about to embark on a massive defoliation campaign, and... er, burn down all the forests. I think you'll all agree that's a sensible move under the circumstances." 
The crowd seemed a little uncertain about this for a second or two until someone pointed out how much this would increase the value of the leaves in their pockets whereupon they let out whoops of delight and gave the Management Consultant a standing ovation. The accountants amongst them looked forward to a profitable Autumn. 
"You're all mad," explained Ford Prefect. "You're absolutely barmy," he suggested. "You're a bunch of raving nutters," he opined. 
The tide of opinion started to turn against him. What had started out as excellent entertainment had now, in the crowd's view, deteriorated into mere abuse, and since this abuse was in the main directed at them they wearied of it. 
Sensing this shift in the wind, the marketing girl turned on him. 
"Is it perhaps in order," she demanded, "to inquire what you've been doing all these months then? You and that other interloper have been missing since the day we arrived." 
"We've been on a journey," said Ford, "We went to try and find out something about this planet." 
"Oh," said the girl archly, "doesn't sound very productive to me." 
"No? Well have I got news for you, my love. We have discovered this planet's future." 
Ford waited for this statement to have its effect. It didn't have any. They didn't know what he was talking about. 
He continued. 
"It doesn't matter a pair of fetid dingo's kidneys what you all choose to do from now on. Burn down the forests, anything, it won't make a scrap of difference. Your future history has already happened. Two million years you've got and that's it. At the end of that time your race will be dead, gone and good riddance to you. Remember that, two million years!" 
The crowd muttered to itself in annoyance. People as rich as they had suddenly become shouldn't be obliged to listen to this sort of gibberish. Perhaps they could tip the fellow a leaf or two and he would go away. 
They didn't need to bother. Ford was already stalking out of the clearing, pausing only to shake his head at Number Two who was already firing his Kill-O-Zap gun into some neighbouring trees. 
He turned back once. 
"Two million years!" he said and laughed. 
"Well," said the Captain with a soothing smile, "still time for a few more baths. Could someone pass me the sponge? I just dropped it over the side." 
Chapter 33 
A mile or so away through the wood, Arthur Dent was too busily engrossed with what he was doing to hear Ford Prefect approach. 
What he was doing was rather curious, and this is what it was: on a wide flat piece of rock he had scratched out the shape of a large square, subdivided into one hundred and sixty-nine smaller squares, thirteen to a side. 
Furthermore he had collected together a pile of smallish flattish stones and scratched the shape of a letter on to each. Sitting morosely round the rock were a couple of the surviving local native men whom Arthur Dent was trying to introduce the curious concept embodied in these stones. 
So far they had not done well. They had attempted to eat some of them, bury others and throw the rest of them away. Arthur had finally encouraged one of them to lay a couple of stones on the board he had scratched out, which was not even as far as he'd managed to get the day before. Along with the rapid deterioration in the morale of these creatures, there seemed to be a corresponding deterioration in their actual intelligence. 
In an attempt to egg them along, Arthur set out a number of letters on the board himself, and then tried to encourage the natives to add some more themselves. 
It was not going well. 
Ford watched quietly from beside a nearby tree. 
"No," said Arthur to one of the natives who had just shuffled some of the letters round in a fit of abysmal dejection, "Q scores ten you see, and it's on a triple word score, so... look, I've explained the rules to you... no no, look please, put down that jawbone... alright, we'll start again. And try to concentrate this time." 
Ford leaned his elbow against the tree and his hand against his head. 
"What are you doing, Arthur?" he asked quietly. 
Arthur looked up with a start. He suddenly had a feeling that all this might look slightly foolish. All he knew was that it had worked like a dream on him when he was a child. But things were different then, or rather would be. 
"I'm trying to teach the cavemen to play Scrabble," he said. "They're not cavemen," said Ford.â¨"They look like cavemen."â¨Ford let it pass. 
"I see," he said. 
"It's uphill work," said Arthur wearily, "the only word they know is grunt and they can't spell it." 
He sighed and sat back. 
"What's that supposed to achieve?" asked Ford. 
"We've got to encourage them to evolve! To develop!" Arthur burst out angrily. He hoped that the weary sigh and then the anger might do something to counteract the overriding feeling of foolishness from which he was currently suffering. It didn't. He jumped to his feet. 
"Can you imagine what a world would be like descended from those... cretins we arrived with?" he said. 
"Imagine?" said Ford, rising his eyebrows. "We don't have to imagine. We've seen it." 
"But..." Arthur waved his arms about hopelessly. 
"We've seen it," said Ford, "there's no escape." 
Arthur kicked at a stone. 
"Did you tell them what we've discovered?" he asked. 
"Hmmmm?" said Ford, not really concentrating. 
"Norway," said Arthur, "Slartibartfast's signature in the glacier. Did you tell them?" 
"What's the point?" said Ford, "What would it mean to them?" 
"Mean?" said Arthur, "Mean? You know perfectly well what it means. It means that this planet is the Earth! It's my home! It's where I was born!" 
"Was?" said Ford. "Alright, will be." 
"Yes, in two million years' time. Why don't you tell them that? Go and say to them, 'Excuse me, I'd just like to point out that in two million years' time I will be born just a few miles from here.' See what they say. They'll chase you up a tree and set fire to it." 
Arthur absorbed this unhappily. 
"Face it," said Ford, "those zeebs over there are your ancestors, not these poor creatures here." 
He went over to where the apemen creatures were rummaging listlessly with the stone letters. He shook his head. 
"Put the Scrabble away, Arthur," he said, "it won't save the human race, because this lot aren't going to be the human race. The human race is currently sitting round a rock on the other side of this hill making documentaries about themselves." 
Arthur winced. 
"There must be something we can do," he said. A terrible sense of desolation thrilled through his body that he should be here, on the Earth, the Earth which had lost its future in a horrifying arbitrary catastrophe and which now seemed set to lose its past as well. 
"No," said Ford, "there's nothing we can do. This doesn't changeâ¨the history of the Earth, you see, this is the history of the Earth. Like it or leave it, the Golgafrinchans are the people you are descended from. In two million years they get destroyed by the Vogons. History isâ¨never altered you see, it just fits together like a jigsaw. Funny old thing, life, isn't it?" 
He picked up the letter Q and hurled it into a distant pivet bush where it hit a young rabbit. The rabbit hurtled off in terror and didn't stop till it was set upon and eaten by a fox which choked on one of its bones and died on the bank of a stream which subsequently washed it away. 
During the following weeks Ford Prefect swallowed his pride and struck up a relationship with a girl who had been a personnel officer on Golgafrincham, and he was terribly upset when she suddenly passed away as a result of drinking water from a pool that had been polluted by the body of a dead fox. The only moral it is possible to draw from this story is that one should never throw the letter Q into a pivet bush, but unfortunately there are times when it is unavoidable. 
Like most of the really crucial things in life, this chain of events was completely invisible to Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent. They were looking sadly at one of the natives morosely pushing the other letters around. 
"Poor bloody caveman," said Arthur. "They're not..."â¨"What?"â¨"Oh never mind." 
The wretched creature let out a pathetic howling noise and banged on the rock. 
"It's all been a bit of waste of time for them, hasn't it?" said Arthur. 
"Uh uh urghhhhh," muttered the native and banged on the rock again. 
"They've been outevolved by telephone sanitizers." 
"Urgh, gr gr, gruh!" insisted the native, continuing to bang on the rock. 
"Why does he keep banging on the rock?" said Arthur. 
"I think he probably wants you to Scrabble with him again," said Ford, "he's pointing at the letters." 
"Probably spelt crzjgrdwldiwdc again, poor bastard. I keep on telling him there's only one g in crzjgrdwldiwdc." 
The native banged on the rock again. 
They looked over his shoulder. 
Their eyes popped. 
There amongst the jumble of letters were eight that had been laid out in a clear straight line. 
They spelt two words. The words were these: "Forty-Two." 
"Grrrurgh guh guh," explained the native. He swept the letters angrily away and went and mooched under a nearby tree with his colleague. 
Ford and Arthur stared at him. Then they stared at each other. "Did that say what I thought it said?" they both said to each other. "Yes," they both said. 
"Forty-two," said Arthur. 
"Forty-two," said Ford. 
Arthur ran over to the two natives. 
"What are you trying to tell us?" he shouted. "What's it supposed to mean?" 
One of them rolled over on the ground, kicked his legs up in the air, rolled over again and went to sleep. 
The other bounded up the tree and threw horse chestnuts at Ford Prefect. Whatever it was they had to say, they had already said it. 
"You know what this means," said Ford. 
"Not entirely." 
"Forty-two is the number Deep Thought gave as being the Ultimate Answer." 
"Yes." 
And the Earth is the computer Deep Thought designed and built to calculate the Question to the Ultimate Answer." 
"So we are led to believe."â¨"And organic life was part of the computer matrix." "If you say so." 
"I do say so. That means that these natives, these apemen are an integral part of the computer program, and that we and the Golgafrinchans are not." 
"But the cavemen are dying out and the Golgafrinchans are obviously set to replace them." 
"Exactly. So do you see what this means?" "What?"â¨"Cock up," said Ford Prefect.â¨Arthur looked around him. 
"This planet is having a pretty bloody time of it," he said. 
Ford puzzled for a moment. 
"Still, something must have come out of it," he said at last, "because Marvin said he could see the Question printed in your brain wave patterns." 
"But..." 
"Probably the wrong one, or a distortion of the right one. It might give us a clue though if we could find it. I don't see how we can though." 
They moped about for a bit. Arthur sat on the ground and started pulling up bits of grass, but found that it wasn't an occupation he could get deeply engrossed in. It wasn't grass he could believe in, the trees seemed pointless, the rolling hills seemed to be rolling to nowhere and the future seemed just a tunnel to be crawled through. 
Ford fiddled with his Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic. It was silent. He sighed and put it away. 
Arthur picked up one of the letter stones from his home-made Scrabble set. It was a T. He sighed and out it down again. The letter he put down next to it was an I. That spelt IT. He tossed another couple of letters next to them They were an S and an H as it happened. By a curious coincidence the resulting word perfectly expressed the way Arthur was feeling about things just then. He stared at it for a moment. He hadn't done it deliberately, it was just a random chance. His brain got slowly into first gear. 
"Ford," he said suddenly, "look, if that Question is printed in my brain wave patterns but I'm not consciously aware of it it must be somewhere in my unconscious." 
"Yes, I suppose so." 
"There might be a way of bringing that unconscious pattern forward." 
"Oh yes?" 
"Yes, by introducing some random element that can be shaped by that pattern." 
"Like how?" 
"Like by pulling Scrabble letters out of a bag blindfolded." 
Ford leapt to his feet. 
"Brilliant!" he said. He tugged his towel out of his satchel and with a few deft knots transformed it into a bag. 
"Totally mad," he said, "utter nonsense. But we'll do it because it's brilliant nonsense. Come on, come on." 
The sun passed respectfully behind a cloud. A few small sad raindrops fell. 
They piled together all the remaining letters and dropped them into the bag. They shook them up. 
"Right," said Ford, "close your eyes. Pull them out. Come on come on, come on." 
Arthur closed his eyes and plunged his hand into the towelful of stones. He jiggled them about, pulled out four and handed them to Ford. Ford laid them along the ground in the order he got them. 
"W," said Ford, "H, A, T... What!"â¨He blinked.â¨"I think it's working!" he said.â¨Arthur pushed three more at him.â¨"D, O, Y... Doy. Oh perhaps it isn't working," said Ford. "Here's the next three." 
"O, U, G... Doyoug... It's not making sense I'm afraid." 
Arthur pulled another two from the bag. Ford put them in place. 
"E, T, doyouget... Do you get!" shouted Ford, "it is working! This is amazing, it really is working!" 
"More here." Arthur was throwing them out feverishly as fast as he could go. 
"I, F," said Ford, "Y, O, U,... M, U, L, T, I, P, L, Y,... What do you get if you multiply,... S, I, X,... six, B, Y, by, six by... what do you get if you multiply six by... N, I, N, E,... six by nine..." He paused. "Come on, where's the next one?" 
"Er, that's the lot," said Arthur, "that's all there were." 
He sat back, nonplussed. 
He rooted around again in the knotted up towel but there were no more letters. 
"You mean that's it?" said Ford. "That's it."â¨"Six by nine. Forty-two." "That's it. That's all there is." 
Chapter 34 
The sun came out and beamed cheerfully at them. A bird sang. A warm breeze wafted through the trees and lifted the heads of the flowers, carrying their scent away through the woods. An insect droned past on its way to do whatever it is that insects do in the late afternoon. The sound of voices lilted through the trees followed a moment later by two girls who stopped in surprise at the sight of Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent apparently lying on the ground in agony, but in fact rocking with noiseless laughter. 
"No, don't go," called Ford Prefect between gasps, "we'll be with you in a moment." 
"What's the matter?" asked one of the girls. She was the taller and slimmer of the two. On Golgafrincham she had been a junior personnel officer, but hadn't liked it much. 
Ford pulled himself together. 
"Excuse me," he said, "hello. My friend and I were just contemplating the meaning of life. Frivolous exercise." 
"Oh it's you," said the girl, "you made a bit of a spectacle of yourself this afternoon. You were quite funny to begin with but you did bang on a bit." 
"Did I? Oh yes." 
"Yes, what was all that for?" asked the other girl, a shorter round- faced girl who had been an art director for a small advertising company on Golgafrincham. Whatever the privations of this world were, she went to sleep every night profoundly grateful for the fact that whatever she had to face in the morning it wouldn't be a hundred almost identical photographs of moodily lit tubes of toothpaste. 
"For? For nothing. Nothing's for anything," said Ford Prefect happily. "Come and join us. I'm Ford, this is Arthur. We were just about to do nothing at all for a while but it can wait." 
The girls looked at them doubtfully. 
"I'm Agda," said the tall one, "this is Mella." 
"Hello Agda, hello Mella," said Ford. 
"Do you talk at all?" said Mella to Arthur. 
"Oh, eventually," said Arthur with a smile, "but not as much as Ford." 
"Good." 
There was a slight pause. 
"What did you mean," asked Agda, "about only having two million years? I couldn't make sense of what you were saying." 
"Oh that," said Ford, "it doesn't matter." 
"It's just that the world gets demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass," said Arthur with a shrug, "but that's two million years away, and anyway it's just Vogons doing what Vogons do." 
"Vogons?" said Mella. 
"Yes, you wouldn't know them." 
"Where'd you get this idea from?" 
"It really doesn't matter. It's just like a dream from the past, or the future." Arthur smiled and looked away. 
"Does it worry you that you don't talk any kind of sense?" asked Agda. 
"Listen, forget it," said Ford, "forget all of it. Nothing matters. Look, it's a beautiful day, enjoy it. The sun, the green of the hills, the river down in the valley, the burning trees." 
"Even if it's only a dream, it's a pretty horrible idea," said Mella, "destroying a world just to make a bypass." 
"Oh, I've heard of worse," said Ford, "I read of one planet off in the seventh dimension that got used as a ball in a game of intergalactic bar billiards. Got potted straight into a black hole. Killed ten billion people." 
"That's mad," said Mella. 
"Yes, only scored thirty points too." 
Agda and Mella exchanged glances. 
"Look," said Agda, "there's a party after the committee meeting tonight. You can come along if you like." 
"Yeah, OK," said Ford. 
"I'd like to," said Arthur. 
Many hours later Arthur and Mella sat and watched the moon rise over the dull red glow of the trees. 
"That story about the world being destroyed..." began Mella. "In two million years, yes."â¨"You say it as if you really think it's true."â¨"Yes, I think it is. I think I was there." 
She shook her head in puzzlement. 
"You're very strange," she said. 
"No, I'm very ordinary," said Arthur, "but some very strange things have happened to me. You could say I'm more differed from than differing." 
"And that other world your friend talked about, the one that got pushed into a black hole." 
"Ah, that I don't know about. It sounds like something from the book." 
"What book?"â¨Arthur paused.â¨"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," he said at last. "What's that?" 
"Oh, just something I threw into the river this evening. I don't think I'll be wanting it any more," said Arthur Dent. 
DOUGLAS ADAMS 
LIFE, THE UNIVERSE AND EVERYTHING 
for Sally 
Chapter 1 
The regular early morning yell of horror was the sound of Arthur Dent waking up and suddenly remembering where he was. 
It wasn't just that the cave was cold, it wasn't just that it was damp and smelly. It was the fact that the cave was in the middle of Islington and there wasn't a bus due for two million years. 
Time is the worst place, so to speak, to get lost in, as Arthur Dent could testify, having been lost in both time and space a good deal. At least being lost in space kept you busy. 
He was stranded in prehistoric Earth as the result of a complex sequence of events which had involved him being alternately blown up and insulted in more bizarre regions of the Galaxy than he ever dreamt existed, and though his life had now turned very, very, very quiet, he was still feeling jumpy. 
He hadn't been blown up now for five years. 
Since he had hardly seen anyone since he and Ford Prefect had parted company four years previously, he hadn't been insulted in all that time either. 
Except just once. 
It had happened on a spring evening about two years previously. 
He was returning to his cave just a little after dusk when he became aware of lights flashing eerily through the clouds. He turned and stared, with hope suddenly clambering through his heart. Rescue. Escape. The castaway's impossible dream a ship. 
And as he watched, as he stared in wonder and excitement, a long silver ship descended through the warm evening air, quietly, without fuss, its long legs unlocking in a smooth ballet of technology. 
It alighted gently on the ground, and what little hum it had generated died away, as if lulled by the evening calm. 
A ramp extended itself. Light streamed out. 
A tall figure appeared silhouetted in the hatchway. It walked down the ramp and stood in front of Arthur. 
"You're a jerk, Dent," it said simply. 
It was alien, very alien. It had a peculiar alien tallness, a peculiar alien flattened head, peculiar slitty little alien eyes, extravagantly draped golden ropes with a peculiarly alien collar design, and pale grey-green alien skin which had about it that lustrous shine which most grey-green faces can only acquire with plenty of exercise and very expensive soap. 
Arthur boggled at it. 
It gazed levelly at him. 
Arthur's first sensations of hope and trepidation had instantly been overwhelmed by astonishment, and all sorts of thoughts were battling for the use of his vocal chords at this moment. 
"Whh...?" he said. 
"Bu... hu... uh..." he added. 
"Ru... ra... wah... who?" he managed finally to say and lapsed into a frantic kind of silence. He was feeling the effects of having not said anything to anybody for as long as he could remember. 
The alien creature frowned briefly and consulted what appeared to be some species of clipboard which he was holding in his thin and spindly alien hand. 
"Arthur Dent?" it said. 
Arthur nodded helplessly. 
"Arthur Philip Dent?" pursued the alien in a kind of efficient yap. 
"Er... er... yes... er... er," confirmed Arthur. 
"You're a jerk," repeated the alien, "a complete asshole." 
"Er..." 
The creature nodded to itself, made a peculiar alien tick on its clipboard and turned briskly back towards the ship. 
"Er..." said Arthur desperately, "er..." 
"Don't give me that!" snapped the alien. It marched up the ramp, through the hatchway and disappeared into the ship. The ship sealed itself. It started to make a low throbbing hum. 
"Er, hey!" shouted Arthur, and started to run helplessly towards it. "Wait a minute!" he called. "What is this? What? Wait a minute!" 
The ship rose, as if shedding its weight like a cloak to the ground, and hovered briefly. It swept strangely up into the evening sky. It passed up through the clouds, illuminating them briefly, and then was gone, leaving Arthur alone in an immensity of land dancing a helplessly tiny little dance. 
"What?" he screamed. "What? What? Hey, what? Come back here and say that!" 
He jumped and danced until his legs trembled, and shouted till his lungs rasped. There was no answer from anyone. There was no one to hear him or speak to him. 
The alien ship was already thundering towards the upper reaches of the atmosphere, on its way out into the appalling void which separates the very few things there are in the Universe from each other. 
Its occupant, the alien with the expensive complexion, leaned back in its single seat. His name was Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged. He was a man with a purpose. Not a very good purpose, as he would have been the first to admit, but it was at least a purpose and it did at least keep him on the move. 
Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged was indeed, is one of the Universe's very small number of immortal beings. 
Those who are born immortal instinctively know how to cope with it, but Wowbagger was not one of them. Indeed he had come to hate them, the load of serene bastards. He had had his immortality thrust upon him by an unfortunate accident with an irrational particle accelerator, a liquid lunch and a pair of rubber bands. The precise details of the accident are not important because no one has ever managed to duplicate the exact circumstances under which it happened, and many people have ended up looking very silly, or dead, or both, trying. 
Wowbagger closed his eyes in a grim and weary expression, put some light jazz on the ship's stereo, and reflected that he could have made it if it hadn't been for Sunday afternoons, he really could have done. 
To begin with it was fun, he had a ball, living dangerously, taking risks, cleaning up on high-yield long-term investments, and just generally outliving the hell out of everybody. 
In the end, it was the Sunday afternoons he couldn't cope with, and that terrible listlessness which starts to set in at about 2.55, when you know that you've had all the baths you can usefully have that day, that however hard you stare at any given paragraph in the papers you will never actually read it, or use the revolutionary new pruning technique it describes, and that as you stare at the clock the hands will move relentlessly on to four o'clock, and you will enter the long dark teatime of the soul. 
So things began to pall for him. The merry smiles he used to wear at other people's funerals began to fade. He began to despise the Universe in general, and everyone in it in particular. 
This was the point at which he conceived his purpose, the thing which would drive him on, and which, as far as he could see, would drive him on forever. It was this. 
He would insult the Universe. 
That is, he would insult everybody in it. Individually, personally, one by one, and (this was the thing he really decided to grit his teeth over) in alphabetical order. 
When people protested to him, as they sometimes had done, that the plan was not merely misGuided but actually impossible because of the number of people being born and dying all the time, he would merely fix them with a steely look and say, "A man can dream can't he?" 
And so he started out. He equipped a spaceship that was built to last with the computer capable of handling all the data processing involved in keeping track of the entire population of the known Universe and working out the horrifically complicated routes involved. 
His ship fled through the inner orbits of the Sol star system, preparing to slingshot round the sun and fling itself out into interstellar space. 
"Computer," he said.â¨"Here," yipped the computer. "Where next?"â¨"Computing that." 
Wowbagger gazed for a moment at the fantastic jewellery of the night, the billions of tiny diamond worlds that dusted the infinite darkness with light. Every one, every single one, was on his itinerary. Most of them he would be going to millions of times over. 
He imagined for a moment his itinerary connecting up all the dots in the sky like a child's numbered dots puzzle. He hoped that from some vantage point in the Universe it might be seen to spell a very, very rude word. 
The computer beeped tunelessly to indicate that it had finished its calculations. 
"Folfanga," it said. It beeped. 
"Fourth world of the Folfanga system," it continued. It beeped again. 
"Estimated journey time, three weeks," it continued further. It beeped again. 
"There to meet with a small slug," it beeped, "of the genus A-Rth- Urp-Hil-Ipdenu." 
"I believe," it added, after a slight pause during which it beeped, "that you had decided to call it a brainless prat." 
Wowbagger grunted. He watched the majesty of creation outside his window for a moment or two. 
"I think I'll take a nap," he said, and then added, "what network areas are we going to be passing through in the next few hours?" 
The computer beeped. 
"Cosmovid, Thinkpix and Home Brain Box," it said, and beeped. 
"Any movies I haven't seen thirty thousand times already?" 
"No." 
"Uh." 
"There's Angst in Space. You've only seen that thirty-three thousand five hundred and seventeen times." 
"Wake me for the second reel." The computer beeped.â¨"Sleep well," it said.â¨The ship fled on through the night. 
Meanwhile, on Earth, it began to pour with rain and Arthur Dent sat in his cave and had one of the most truly rotten evenings of his entire life, thinking of things he could have said to the alien and swatting flies, who also had a rotten evening. 
The next day he made himself a pouch out of rabbit skin because he thought it would be useful to keep things in. 
Chapter 2 
This morning, two years later than that, was sweet and fragrant as he emerged from the cave he called home until he could think of a better name for it or find a better cave. 
Though his throat was sore again from his early morning yell of horror, he was suddenly in a terrifically good mood. He wrapped his dilapidated dressing gown tightly around him and beamed at the bright morning. 
The air was clear and scented, the breeze flitted lightly through the tall grass around his cave, the birds were chirruping at each other, the butterflies were flitting about prettily, and the whole of nature seemed to be conspiring to be as pleasant as it possibly could. 
It wasn't all the pastoral delights that were making Arthur feel so cheery, though. He had just had a wonderful idea about how to cope with the terrible lonely isolation, the nightmares, the failure of all his attempts at horticulture, and the sheer futurelessness and futility of his life here on prehistoric Earth, which was that he would go mad. 
He beamed again and took a bite out of a rabbit leg left over from his supper. He chewed happily for a few moments and then decided formally to announce his decision. 
He stood up straight and looked the world squarely in the fields and hills. To add weight to his words he stuck the rabbit bone in his hair. He spread his arms out wide. 
"I will go mad!" he announced. 
"Good idea," said Ford Prefect, clambering down from the rock on which he had been sitting. 
Arthur's brain somersaulted. His jaw did press-ups.â¨"I went mad for a while," said Ford, "did me no end of good." "You see," said Ford, " ..." 
"Where have you been?" interrupted Arthur, now that his head had finished working out. 
"Around," said Ford, "around and about." He grinned in what he accurately judged to be an infuriating manner. "I just took my mind off the hook for a bit. I reckoned that if the world wanted me badly enough it would call back. It did." 
He took out of his now terribly battered and dilapidated satchel his Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic. 
"At least," he said, "I think it did. This has been playing up a bit." He shook it. "If it was a false alarm I shall go mad," he said, "again." 
Arthur shook his head and sat down. He looked up. 
"I thought you must be dead..." he said simply. 
"So did I for a while," said Ford, "and then I decided I was a lemon for a couple of weeks. A kept myself amused all that time jumping in and out of a gin and tonic." 
Arthur cleared his throat, and then did it again. 
"Where," he said, "did you...?" 
"Find a gin and tonic?" said Ford brightly. "I found a small lake that thought it was a gin and tonic, and jumped in and out of that. At least, I think it thought it was a gin and tonic." 
"I may," he added with a grin which would have sent sane men scampering into trees, "have been imagining it." 
He waited for a reaction from Arthur, but Arthur knew better than that. 
"Carry on," he said levelly. 
"The point is, you see," said Ford, "that there is no point in driving yourself mad trying to stop yourself going mad. You might just as well give in and save your sanity for later." 
"And this is you sane again, is it?" said Arthur. "I ask merely for information." 
"I went to Africa," said Ford. "Yes?"â¨"Yes."â¨"What was that like?" 
"And this is your cave is it?" said Ford. 
"Er, yes," said Arthur. He felt very strange. After nearly four years of total isolation he was so pleased and relieved to see Ford that he 
could almost cry. Ford was, on the other hand, an almost immediately annoying person. 
"Very nice," said Ford, in reference to Arthur's cave. "You must hate it." 
Arthur didn't bother to reply. 
"Africa was very interesting," said Ford, "I behaved very oddly there." 
He gazed thoughtfully into the distance. 
"I took up being cruel to animals," he said airily. "But only," he added, "as a hobby." 
"Oh yes," said Arthur, warily. 
"Yes," Ford assured him. "I won't disturb you with the details because they would " 
"What?" 
"Disturb you. But you may be interested to know that I am singlehandedly responsible for the evolved shape of the animal you came to know in later centuries as a giraffe. And I tried to learn to fly. Do you believe me?" 
"Tell me," said Arthur.â¨"I'll tell you later. I'll just mention that the Guide says..." "The...?"â¨"Guide. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. You remember?" "Yes. I remember throwing it in the river."â¨"Yes," said Ford, "but I fished it out."â¨"You didn't tell me."â¨"I didn't want you to throw it in again."â¨"Fair enough," admitted Arthur. "It says?"â¨"What?"â¨"The Guide says?" 
"The Guide says there is an art to flying," said Ford, "or rather a knack. The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss." He smiled weakly. He pointed at the knees of his trousers and held his arms up to show the elbows. They were all torn and worn through. 
"I haven't done very well so far," he said. He stuck out his hand. "I'm very glad to see you again, Arthur," he added. 
Arthur shook his head in a sudden access of emotion and bewilderment. 
"I haven't seen anyone for years," he said, "not anyone. I can hardly even remember how to speak. I keep forgetting words. I practise you see. I practise by talking to... talking to... what are those things people think you're mad if you talk to? Like George the Third." 
"Kings?" suggested Ford. 
"No, no," said Arthur. "The things he used to talk to. We're surrounded by them for heaven's sake. I've planted hundreds myself. They all died. Trees! I practise by talking to trees. What's that for?" 
Ford still had his hand stuck out. Arthur looked at it with incomprehension. 
"Shake," prompted Ford. 
Arthur did, nervously at first, as if it might turn out to be a fish. Then he grasped it vigorously with both hands in an overwhelming flood of relief. He shook it and shook it. 
After a while Ford found it necessary to disengage. They climbed to the top of a nearby outcrop of rock and surveyed the scene around them. 
"What happened to the Golgafrinchans?" asked Ford. 
Arthur shrugged. 
"A lot of them didn't make it through the winter three years ago," he said, "and the few who remained in the spring said they needed a holiday and set off on a raft. History says that they must have survived..." 
"Huh," said Ford, "well well." He stuck his hands on his hips and looked round again at the empty world. Suddenly, there was about Ford a sense of energy and purpose. 
"We're going," he said excitedly, and shivered with energy. 
"Where? How?" said Arthur. 
"I don't know," said Ford, "but I just feel that the time is right. Things are going to happen. We're on our way." 
He lowered his voice to a whisper.â¨"I have detected," he said, "disturbances in the wash." 
He gazed keenly into the distance and looked as if he would quite like the wind to blow his hair back dramatically at that point, but the wind was busy fooling around with some leaves a little way off. 
Arthur asked him to repeat what he had just said because he hadn't quite taken his meaning. Ford repeated it. 
"The wash?" said Arthur. 
"The space-time wash," said Ford, and as the wind blew briefly past at that moment, he bared his teeth into it. 
Arthur nodded, and then cleared his throat. 
"Are we talking about," he asked cautiously, "some sort of Vogon laundromat, or what are we talking about?" 
"Eddies," said Ford, "in the space-time continuum." 
"Ah," nodded Arthur, "is he? Is he?" He pushed his hands into the pocket of his dressing gown and looked knowledgeably into the distance. 
"What?" said Ford.â¨"Er, who," said Arthur, "is Eddy, then, exactly?"â¨Ford looked angrily at him.â¨"Will you listen?" he snapped.â¨"I have been listening," said Arthur, "but I'm not sure it's helped." 
Ford grasped him by the lapels of his dressing gown and spoke to him as slowly and distinctly and patiently as if he were somebody from a telephone company accounts department. 
"There seem..." he said, "to be some pools..." he said, "of instability..." he said, "in the fabric..." he said... 
Arthur looked foolishly at the cloth of his dressing gown where Ford was holding it. Ford swept on before Arthur could turn the foolish look into a foolish remark. 
"... in the fabric of space-time," he said. 
"Ah, that," said Arthur. 
"Yes, that," confirmed Ford. 
They stood there alone on a hill on prehistoric Earth and stared each other resolutely in the face. 
"And it's done what?" said Arthur.â¨"It," said Ford, "has developed pools of instability." 
"Has it?" said Arthur, his eyes not wavering for a moment. "It has," said Ford with a similar degree of ocular immobility. "Good," said Arthur.â¨"See?" said Ford.â¨"No," said Arthur.â¨There was a quiet pause. 
"The difficulty with this conversation," said Arthur after a sort of pondering look had crawled slowly across his face like a mountaineer negotiating a tricky outcrop, "is that it's very different from most of the ones I've had of late. Which, as I explained, have mostly been with trees. They weren't like this. Except perhaps some of the ones I've had with elms which sometimes get a bit bogged down." 
"Arthur," said Ford. 
"Hello? Yes?" said Arthur. 
"Just believe everything I tell you, and it will all be very, very simple." 
"Ah, well I'm not sure I believe that." 
They sat down and composed their thoughts. 
Ford got out his Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic. It was making vague humming noises and a tiny light on it was flickering faintly. 
"Flat battery?" said Arthur. 
"No," said Ford, "there is a moving disturbance in the fabric of space-time, an eddy, a pool of instability, and it's somewhere in our vicinity." 
"Where?" 
Ford moved the device in a slow lightly bobbing semi-circle. Suddenly the light flashed. 
"There!" said Ford, shooting out his arm. "There, behind that sofa!" 
Arthur looked. Much to his surprise, there was a velvet paisley- covered Chesterfield sofa in the field in front of them. He boggled intelligently at it. Shrewd questions sprang into his mind. 
"Why," he said, "is there a sofa in that field?" 
"I told you!" shouted Ford, leaping to his feet. "Eddies in the space- time continuum!" 
"And this is his sofa, is it?" asked Arthur, struggling to his feet and, he hoped, though not very optimistically, to his senses. 
"Arthur!" shouted Ford at him, "that sofa is there because of the space-time instability I've been trying to get your terminally softened brain to get to grips with. It's been washed out of the continuum, it's space-time jetsam, it doesn't matter what it is, we've got to catch it, it's our only way out of here!" 
He scrambled rapidly down the rocky outcrop and made off across the field. 
"Catch it?" muttered Arthur, then frowned in bemusement as he saw that the Chesterfield was lazily bobbing and wafting away across the grass. 
With a whoop of utterly unexpected delight he leapt down the rock and plunged off in hectic pursuit of Ford Prefect and the irrational piece of furniture. 
They careered wildly through the grass, leaping, laughing, shouting instructions to each other to head the thing off this way or that way. The sun shone dreamily on the swaying grass, tiny field animals scattered crazily in their wake. 
Arthur felt happy. He was terribly pleased that the day was for once working out so much according to plan. Only twenty minutes ago he had decided he would go mad, and now he was already chasing a Chesterfield sofa across the fields of prehistoric Earth. 
The sofa bobbed this way and that and seemed simultaneously to be as solid as the trees as it drifted past some of them and hazy as a billowing dream as it floated like a ghost through others. 
Ford and Arthur pounded chaotically after it, but it dodged and weaved as if following its own complex mathematical topography, which it was. Still they pursued, still it danced and span, and suddenly turned and dipped as if crossing the lip of a catastrophe graph, and they were practically on top of it. With a heave and a shout they leapt on it, the sun winked out, they fell through a sickening nothingness, and emerged unexpectedly in the middle of the pitch at Lord's Cricked Ground, St John's Wood, London, towards the end of the last Test Match of the Australian Series in the year 198-, with England needing only twenty-eight runs to win.

Chapter 3 
It was a charming and delightful day at Lord's as Ford and Arthur tumbled haphazardly out of a space-time anomaly and hit the immaculate turf rather hard. 
The applause of the crowd was tremendous. It wasn't for them, but instinctively they bowed anyway, which was fortunate because the small red heavy ball which the crowd actually had been applauding whistled mere millimetres over Arthur's head. In the crowd a man collapsed. 
They threw themselves back to the ground which seemed to spin hideously around them. 
"What was that?" hissed Arthur. "Something red," hissed Ford back at him. "Where are we?"â¨"Er, somewhere green."â¨"Shapes," muttered Arthur. "I need shapes." 
The applause of the crowd had been rapidly succeeded by gasps of astonishment, and the awkward titters of hundreds of people who could not yet make up their minds about whether to believe what they had just seen or not. 
"This your sofa?" said a voice. "What was that?" whispered Ford. Arthur looked up.â¨"Something blue," he said. "Shape?" said Ford.â¨Arthur looked again. 
"It is shaped," he hissed at Ford, with his brow savagely furrowing, "like a policeman." 
They remained crouched there for a few moments, frowning deeply. The blue thing shaped like a policeman tapped them both on the shoulders. 
"Come on, you two," the shape said, "let's be having you." 
These words had an electrifying effect on Arthur. He leapt to his feet like an author hearing the phone ring and shot a series of startled glanced at the panorama around him which had suddenly settled down into something of quite terrifying ordinariness. 
"Where did you get this from?" he yelled at the policeman shape. 
"What did you say?" said the startled shape. 
"This is Lord's Cricket Ground, isn't it?" snapped Arthur. "Where did you find it, how did you get it here? I think," he added, clasping his hand to his brow, "that I had better calm down." He squatted down abruptly in front of Ford. 
"It is a policeman," he said, "What do we do?" 
Ford shrugged. 
"What do you want to do?" he said. 
"I want you," said Arthur, "to tell me that I have been dreaming for the last five years." 
Ford shrugged again, and obliged. 
"You've been dreaming for the last five years," he said. 
Arthur got to his feet. 
"It's all right, officer," he said. "I've been dreaming for the last five years. Ask him," he added, pointing at Ford, "he was in it." 
Having said this, he sauntered off towards the edge of the pitch, brushing down his dressing gown. He then noticed his dressing gown and stopped. He stared at it. He flung himself at the policeman. 
"So where did I get these clothes from?" he howled. He collapsed and lay twitching on the grass.â¨Ford shook his head. 
"He's had a bad two million years," he said to the policeman, and together they heaved Arthur on to the sofa and carried him off the pitch and were only briefly hampered by the sudden disappearance of the sofa on the way. 
Reaction to all this from the crowd were many and various. Most of them couldn't cope with watching it, and listened to it on the radio instead. 
"Well, this is an interesting incident, Brian," said one radio commentator to another. "I don't think there have been any mysterious materializations on the pitch since, oh since, well I don't think there have been any have there? that I recall?" 
"Edgbaston, 1932?" 
"Ah, now what happened then..." 
"Well, Peter, I think it was Canter facing Willcox coming up to bowl from the pavilion end when a spectator suddenly ran straight across the pitch." 
There was a pause while the first commentator considered this. 
"Ye... e... s..." he said, "yes, there's nothing actually very mysterious about that, is there? He didn't actually materialize, did he? Just ran on." 
"No, that's true, but he did claim to have seen something materialize on the pitch." 
"Ah, did he?"â¨"Yes. An alligator, I think, of some description." "Ah. And had anyone else noticed it?" 
"Apparently not. And no one was able to get a very detailed description from him, so only the most perfunctory search was made." 
"And what happened to the man?" 
"Well, I think someone offered to take him off and give him some lunch, but he explained that he'd already had a rather good one, so the matter was dropped and Warwickshire went on to win by three wickets." 
"So, not very like this current instance. For those of you who've just tuned in, you may be interested to know that, er... two men, two rather scruffily attired men, and indeed a sofa a Chesterfield I think?" 
"Yes, a Chesterfield." 
"Have just materialized here in the middle of Lord's Cricket Ground. But I don't think they meant any harm, they've been very good- natured about it, and..." 
"Sorry, can I interrupt you a moment Peter and say that the sofa has just vanished." 
"So it has. Well, that's one mystery less. Still, it's definitely one for the record books I think, particularly occurring at this dramatic moment in play, England now needing only twenty-four runs to win the series. The men are leaving the pitch in the company of a police officer, and I think everyone's settling down now and play is about to resume." 
"Now, sir," said the policeman after they had made a passage through the curious crowd and laid Arthur's peacefully inert body on a blanket, "perhaps you'd care to tell me who you are, where you come from, and what that little scene was all about?" 
Ford looked at the ground for a moment as if steadying himself for something, then he straightened up and aimed a look at the policeman which hit him with the full force of every inch of the six hundred light-years' distance between Earth and Ford's home near Betelgeuse. 
"All right," said Ford, very quietly, "I'll tell you." 
"Yes, well, that won't be necessary," said the policeman hurriedly, "just don't let whatever it was happen again." The policeman turned around and wandered off in search of anyone who wasn't from Betelgeuse. Fortunately, the ground was full of them. 
Arthur's consciousness approached his body as from a great distance, and reluctantly. It had had some bad times in there. Slowly, nervously, it entered and settled down in to its accustomed position. 
Arthur sat up. 
"Where am I?" he said. 
"Lord's Cricket Ground," said Ford. 
"Fine," said Arthur, and his consciousness stepped out again for a quick breather. His body flopped back on the grass. 
Ten minutes later, hunched over a cup of tea in the refreshment tent, the colour started to come back to his haggard face. 
"How're you feeling?" said Ford. 
"I'm home," said Arthur hoarsely. He closed his eyes and greedily inhaled the steam from his tea as if it was-well, as far as Arthur was concerned, as if it was tea, which it was. 
"I'm home," he repeated, "home. It's England, it's today, the nightmare is over." He opened his eyes again and smiled serenely. "I'm where I belong," he said in an emotional whisper. 
"There are two things I fell which I should tell you," said Ford, tossing a copy of the Guardian over the table at him. 
"I'm home," said Arthur. 
"Yes," said Ford. "One is," he said pointing at the date at the top of the paper, "that the Earth will be demolished in two days' time." 
"I'm home," said Arthur. "Tea," he said, "cricket," he added with pleasure, "mown grass, wooden benches, white linen jackets, beer cans..." 
Slowly he began to focus on the newspaper. He cocked his head on one side with a slight frown. 
"I've seen that one before," he said. His eyes wandered slowly up to the date, which Ford was idly tapping at. His face froze for a second or two and then began to do that terribly slow crashing trick which Arctic ice floes do so spectacularly in the spring. 
"And the other thing," said Ford, "is that you appear to have a bone in your beard." He tossed back his tea. 
Outside the refreshment tent, the sun was shining on a happy crowd. It shone on white hats and red faces. It shone on ice lollies and melted them. It shone on the tears of small children whose ice lollies had just melted and fallen off the stick. It shone on the trees, it flashed off whirling cricket bats, it gleamed off the utterly extraordinary object which was parked behind the sight-screens and which nobody appeared to have noticed. It beamed on Ford and Arthur as they emerged blinking from the refreshment tent and surveyed the scene around them. 
Arthur was shaking.â¨"Perhaps," he said, "I should..."â¨"No," said Ford sharply.â¨"What?" said Arthur.â¨"Don't try and phone yourself up at home." 
"How did you know...?" 
Ford shrugged. 
"But why not?" said Arthur. 
"People who talk to themselves on the phone," said Ford, "never learn anything to their advantage." 
"But..." 
"Look," said Ford. He picked up an imaginary phone and dialled an imaginary dial. 
"Hello?" he said into the imaginary mouthpiece. "Is that Arthur Dent? Ah, hello, yes. This is Arthur Dent speaking. Don't hang up." 
He looked at the imaginary mouthpiece in disappointment. 
"He hung up," he said, shrugged, and put the imaginary phone neatly back on its imaginary hook. 
"This is not my first temporal anomaly," he added. 
A glummer look replaced the already glum look on Arthur Dent's face. 
"So we're not home and dry," he said. 
"We could not even be said," replied Ford, "to be home and vigorously towelling ourselves off." 
The game continued. The bowler approached the wicket at a lope, a trot, and then a run. He suddenly exploded in a flurry of arms and legs, out of which flew a ball. The batsman swung and thwacked it behind him over the sight-screens. Ford's eyes followed the trajectory of the ball and jogged momentarily. He stiffened. He looked along the flight path of the ball again and his eyes twitched again. 
"This isn't my towel," said Arthur, who was rummaging in his rabbit-skin bag. 
"Shhh," said Ford. He screwed his eyes up in concentration. 
"I had a Golgafrinchan jogging towel," continued Arthur, "it was blue with yellow stars on it. This isn't it." 
"Shhh," said Ford again. He covered one eye and looked with the other. 
"This one's pink," said Arthur, "it isn't yours is it?" 
"I would like you to shut up about your towel," said Ford. 
"It isn't my towel," insisted Arthur, "that is the point I am trying to..." 
"And the time at which I would like you to shut up about it," continued Ford in a low growl, "is now." 
"All right," said Arthur, starting to stuff it back into the primitively stitched rabbit-skin bag. "I realize that it is probably not important in the cosmic scale of things, it's just odd, that's all. A pink towel suddenly, instead of a blue one with yellow stars." 
Ford was beginning to behave rather strangely, or rather not actually beginning to behave strangely but beginning to behave in a way which was strangely different from the other strange ways in which he more regularly behaved. What he was doing was this. Regardless of the bemused stares it was provoking from his fellow members of the crowd gathered round the pitch, he was waving his hands in sharp movements across his face, ducking down behind some people, leaping up behind others, then standing still and blinking a lot. After a moment or two of this he started to stalk forward slowly and stealthily wearing a puzzled frown of concentration, like a leopard that's not sure whether it's just seen a half-empty tin of cat food half a mile away across a hot and dusty plain. 
"This isn't my bag either," said Arthur suddenly. 
Ford's spell of concentration was broken. He turned angrily on Arthur. 
"I wasn't talking about my towel," said Arthur. "We've established that that isn't mine. It's just that the bag into which I was putting the towel which is not mine is also not mine, though it is extraordinarily similar. Now personally I think that that is extremely odd, especiallyâ¨as the bag was one I made myself on prehistoric Earth. These are also not my stones," he added, pulling a few flat grey stones out of the bag. "I was making a collection of interesting stones and these are clearly very dull ones." 
A roar of excitement thrilled through the crowd and obliterated whatever it was that Ford said in reply to this piece of information. The cricket ball which had excited this reaction fell out of the sky and dropped neatly into Arthur's mysterious rabbit-skin bag. 
"Now I would say that that was also a very curious event," said Arthur, rapidly closing the bag and pretending to look for the ball on the ground. 
"I don't think it's here," he said to the small boys who immediately clustered round him to join in the search, "it probably rolled off somewhere. Over there I expect." He pointed vaguely in the direction in which he wished they would push off. One of the boys looked at him quizzically. 
"You all right?" said the boy.â¨"No," said Arthur.â¨"Then why you got a bone in your beard?" said the boy. 
"I'm training it to like being wherever it's put." Arthur prided himself on saying this. It was, he thought, exactly the sort of thing which would entertain and stimulate young minds. 
"Oh," said the small boy, putting his head to one side and thinking about it. "What's your name?" 
"Dent," said Arthur, "Arthur Dent." 
"You're a jerk, Dent," said the boy, "a complete asshole." The boy looked past him at something else, to show that he wasn't in any particular hurry to run away, and then wandered off scratching his nose. Suddenly Arthur remembered that the Earth was going to be demolished again in two days' time, and just this once didn't feel too bad about it. 
Play resumed with a new ball, the sun continued to shine and Ford continued to jump up and down shaking his head and blinking. 
"Something's on your mind, isn't it?" said Arthur. 
"I think," said Ford in a tone of voice which Arthur by now recognized as one which presaged something utterly unintelligible, "that there's an SEP over there." 
He pointed. Curiously enough, the direction he pointed in was not the one in which he was looking. Arthur looked in the one direction, which was towards the sight-screens, and in the other which was at the field of play. He nodded, he shrugged. He shrugged again. 
"A what?" he said. "An SEP."â¨"An S...?"â¨"... EP." 
"And what's that?" "Somebody Else's Problem." 
"Ah, good," said Arthur and relaxed. He had no idea what all that was about, but at least it seemed to be over. It wasn't. 
"Over there," said Ford, again pointing at the sight-screens and looking at the pitch. 
"Where?" said Arthur. 
"There!" said Ford. 
"I see," said Arthur, who didn't. 
"You do?" said Ford. 
"What?" said Arthur. 
"Can you see," said Ford patiently, "the SEP?" 
"I thought you said that was somebody else's problem." 
"That's right." 
Arthur nodded slowly, carefully and with an air of immense stupidity. 
"And I want to know," said Ford, "if you can see it." "You do?"â¨"Yes."â¨"What," said Arthur, "does it look like?" 
"Well, how should I know, you fool?" shouted Ford. "If you can see it, you tell me." 
Arthur experienced that dull throbbing sensation just behind the temples which was a hallmark of so many of his conversations with Ford. His brain lurked like a frightened puppy in its kennel. Ford took him by the arm. 
"An SEP," he said, "is something that we can't see, or don't see, or our brain doesn't let us see, because we think that it's somebody else's problem. That's what SEP means. Somebody Else's Problem. The brain just edits it out, it's like a blind spot. If you look at it directly you won't see it unless you know precisely what it is. Your only hope is to catch it by surprise out of the corner of your eye." 
"Ah," said Arthur, "then that's why..."â¨"Yes," said Ford, who knew what Arthur was going to say. "... you've been jumping up and..."â¨"Yes."â¨"... down, and blinking..." 
"Yes."â¨"... and..."â¨"I think you've got the message."â¨"I can see it," said Arthur, "it's a spaceship." 
For a moment Arthur was stunned by the reaction this revelation provoked. A roar erupted from the crowd, and from every direction people were running, shouting, yelling, tumbling over each other in a tumult of confusion. He stumbled back in astonishment and glanced fearfully around. Then he glanced around again in even greater astonishment. 
"Exciting, isn't it?" said an apparition. The apparition wobbled in front of Arthur's eyes, though the truth of the matter is probably that Arthur's eyes were wobbling in front of the apparition. His mouth wobbled as well. 
"W... w... w... w..." his mouth said. 
"I think your team have just won," said the apparition. 
"W... w... w... w..." repeated Arthur, and punctuated each wobble with a prod at Ford Prefect's back. Ford was staring at the tumult in trepidation. 
"You are English, aren't you?" said the apparition. 
"W... w... w... w... yes" said Arthur. 
"Well, your team, as I say, have just won. The match. It means they retain the Ashes. You must be very pleased. I must say, I'm rather fond of cricket, though I wouldn't like anyone outside this planet to hear me saying that. Oh dear no." 
The apparition gave what looked as if it might have been a mischievous grin, but it was hard to tell because the sun was directly behind him, creating a blinding halo round his head and illuminating his silver hair and beard in a way which was awesome, dramatic and hard to reconcile with mischievous grins. 
"Still," he said, "it'll all be over in a couple of days, won't it? Though as I said to you when we last met, I was very sorry about that. Still, whatever will have been, will have been." 
Arthur tried to speak, but gave up the unequal struggle. He prodded Ford again. 
"I thought something terrible had happened," said Ford, "but it's just the end of the game. We ought to get out. Oh, hello, Slartibartfast, what are you doing here?" 
"Oh, pottering, pottering," said the old man gravely. 
"That your ship? Can you give us a lift anywhere?" 
"Patience, patience," the old man admonished. 
"OK," said Ford. "It's just that this planet's going to be demolished pretty soon." 
"I know that," said Slartibartfast. 
"And, well, I just wanted to make that point," said Ford. 
"The point is taken." 
And if you feel that you really want to hang around a cricket pitch at this point..." 
"I do."â¨"Then it's your ship."â¨"It is."â¨"I suppose." Ford turned away sharply at this point. "Hello, Slartibartfast," said Arthur at last.â¨"Hello, Earthman," said Slartibartfast.â¨"After all," said Ford, "we can only die once." 
The old man ignored this and stared keenly on to the pitch, with eyes that seemed alive with expressions that had no apparent bearing on what was happening out there. What was happening was that the crowd was gathering itself into a wide circle round the centre of the pitch. What Slartibartfast saw in it, he alone knew. 
Ford was humming something. It was just one note repeated at intervals. He was hoping that somebody would ask him what he was humming, but nobody did. If anybody had asked him he would have said he was humming the first line of a NÃ¶el Coward song called "Mad About the Boy" over and over again. It would then have been pointed out to him that he was only singing one note, to which he would have replied that for reasons which he hoped would be apparent, he was omitting the "about the boy" bit. He was annoyed that nobody asked. 
"It's just," he burst out at last, "that if we don't go soon, we might get caught in the middle of it all again. And there's nothing that depresses me more than seeing a planet being destroyed. Except 
possibly still being on it when it happens. Or," he added in an undertone, "hanging around cricket matches." 
"Patience," said Slartibartfast again. "Great things are afoot." "That's what you said last time we met," said Arthur.â¨"They were," said Slartibartfast.â¨"Yes, that's true," admitted Arthur. 
All, however, that seemed to be afoot was a ceremony of some kind. It was being specially staged for the benefit of tv rather than the spectators, and all they could gather about it from where they were standing was what they heard from a nearby radio. Ford was aggressively uninterested. 
He fretted as he heard it explained that the Ashes were about to be presented to the Captain of the English team out there on the pitch, fumed when told that this was because they had now won them for the nth time, positively barked with annoyance at the information that the Ashes were the remains of a cricket stump, and when, further to this, he was asked to contend with the fact that the cricket stump in question had been burnt in Melbourne, Australia, in 1882, to signify the "death of English cricket", he rounded on Slartibartfast, took a deep breath, but didn't have a chance to say anything because the old man wasn't there. He was marching out on to the pitch with terrible purpose in his gait, his hair, beard and robes swept behind him, looking very much as Moses would have looked if Sinai had been a well-cut lawn instead of, as it is more usually represented, a fiery smoking mountain. 
"He said to meet him at his ship," said Arthur. 
"What in the name of zarking fardwarks is the old fool doing?" exploded Ford. 
"Meeting us at his ship in two minutes," said Arthur with a shrug which indicated total abdication of thought. They started off towards it. Strange sounds reached their ears. They tried not to listen, but could not help noticing that Slartibartfast was querulously demanding that he be given the silver urn containing the Ashes, as they were, he said, "vitally important for the past, present and future safety of the Galaxy", and that this was causing wild hilarity. They resolved to ignore it. 
What happened next they could not ignore. With a noise like a hundred thousand people saying "wop", a steely white spaceship suddenly seemed to create itself out of nothing in the air directly above the cricket pitch and hung there with infinite menace and a slight hum. 
Then for a while it did nothing, as if it expected everybody to go about their normal business and not mind it just hanging there. 
Then it did something quite extraordinary. Or rather, it opened up and let something quite extraordinary come out of it, eleven quite extraordinary things. 
They were robots, white robots. 
What was most extraordinary about them was that they appeared to have come dressed for the occasion. Not only were they white, but they carried what appeared to be cricket bats, and not only that, but they also carried what appeared to be cricket balls, and not only that but they wore white ribbing pads round the lower parts of their legs. These last were extraordinary because they appeared to contain jets which allowed these curiously civilized robots to fly down from their hovering spaceship and start to kill people, which is what they did 
"Hello," said Arthur, "something seems to be happening." 
"Get to the ship," shouted Ford. "I don't want to know, I don't want to see, I don't want to hear," he yelled as he ran, "this is not my planet, I didn't choose to be here, I don't want to get involved, just get me out of here, and get me to a party, with people I can relate to!" 
Smoke and flame billowed from the pitch. 
"Well, the supernatural brigade certainly seems to be out in force here today..." burbled a radio happily to itself. 
"What I need," shouted Ford, by way of clarifying his previous remarks, "is a strong drink and a peer-group." He continued to run, pausing only for a moment to grab Arthur's arm and drag him along with him. Arthur had adopted his normal crisis role, which was to stand with his mouth hanging open and let it all wash over him. 
"They're playing cricket," muttered Arthur, stumbling along after Ford. "I swear they are playing cricket. I do not know why they are doing this, but that is what they are doing. They're not just killing 
people, they're sending them up," he shouted, "Ford, they're sending us up!" 
It would have been hard to disbelieve this without knowing a great deal more Galactic history than Arthur had so far managed to pick up in his travels. The ghostly but violent shapes that could be seen moving within the thick pall of smoke seemed to be performing a series of bizarre parodies of batting strokes, the difference being that every ball they struck with their bats exploded wherever it landed. The very first one of these had dispelled Arthur's initial reaction, that the whole thing might just be a publicity stunt by Australian margarine manufacturers. 
And then, as suddenly as it had all started, it was over. The eleven white robots ascended through the seething cloud in a tight formation, and with a few last flashes of flame entered the bowels of their hovering white ship, which, with the noise of a hundred thousand people saying "foop", promptly vanished into the thin air out of which it had wopped. 
For a moment there was a terrible stunned silence, and then out of the drifting smoke emerged the pale figure of Slartibartfast looking even more like Moses because in spite of the continued absence of the mountain he was at least now striding across a fiery and smoking well-mown lawn. 
He stared wildly about him until he saw the hurrying figures of Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect forcing their way through the frightened crowd which was for the moment busy stampeding in the opposite direction. The crowd was clearly thinking to itself about what an unusual day this was turning out to be, and not really knowing which way, if any, to turn. 
Slartibartfast was gesturing urgently at Ford and Arthur and shouting at them, as the three of them gradually converged on his ship, still parked behind the sight-screens and still apparently unnoticed by the crowd stampeding past it who presumably had enough of their own problems to cope with at that time. 
"They've garble warble farble!" shouted Slartibartfast in his thin tremulous voice. 
"What did he say?" panted Ford as he elbowed his way onwards. Arthur shook his head. 
"'They've...' something or other," he said. 
"They've table warble farble!" shouted Slartibartfast again. 
Ford and Arthur shook their heads at each other. 
"It sounds urgent," said Arthur. He stopped and shouted. 
"What?" 
"They've garble warble fashes!" cried Slartibartfast, still waving at them. 
"He says," said Arthur, "that they've taken the Ashes. That is what I think he says." They ran on. 
"The...?" said Ford. 
"Ashes," said Arthur tersely. "The burnt remains of a cricket stump. It's a trophy. That..." he was panting, "is... apparently... what they... have come and taken." He shook his head very slightly as if he was trying to get his brain to settle down lower in his skull. 
"Strange thing to want to tell us," snapped Ford. "Strange thing to take."â¨"Strange ship." 
They had arrived at it. The second strangest thing about the ship was watching the Somebody Else's Problem field at work. They could now clearly see the ship for what it was simply because they knew it was there. It was quite apparent, however, that nobody else could. This wasn't because it was actually invisible or anything hyper- impossible like that. The technology involved in making anything invisible is so infinitely complex that nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand million, nine hundred and ninety-nine million, nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine times out of a billion it is much simpler and more effective just to take the thing away and do without it. The ultra-famous sciento-magician Effrafax of Wug once bet his life that, given a year, he could render the great megamountain Magramal entirely invisible. 
Having spent most of the year jiggling around with immense Lux-O- Valves and Refracto-Nullifiers and Spectrum-Bypass-O-Matics, he realized, with nine hours to go, that he wasn't going to make it. 
So, he and his friends, and his friends' friends, and his friends' friends' friends, and his friends' friends' friends' friends, and some rather less good friends of theirs who happened to own a major stellar trucking company, put in what now is widely recognized as 
being the hardest night's work in history, and, sure enough, on the following day, Magramal was no longer visible. Effrafax lost his bet and therefore his life simply because some pedantic adjudicating official noticed (a) that when walking around the area that Magramal ought to be he didn't trip over or break his nose on anything, and (b) a suspicious-looking extra moon. 
The Somebody Else's Problem field is much simpler and more effective, and what's more can be run for over a hundred years on a single torch battery. This is because it relies on people's natural disposition not to see anything they don't want to, weren't expecting, or can't explain. If Effrafax had painted the mountain pink and erected a cheap and simple Somebody Else's Problem field on it, then people would have walked past the mountain, round it, even over it, and simply never have noticed that the thing was there. 
And this is precisely what was happening with Slartibartfast's ship. It wasn't pink, but if it had been, that would have been the least of its visual problems and people were simply ignoring it like anything. 
The most extraordinary thing about it was that it looked only partly like a spaceship with guidance fins, rocket engines and escape hatches and so on, and a great deal like a small upended Italian bistro. 
Ford and Arthur gazed up at it with wonderment and deeply offended sensibilities. 
"Yes, I know," said Slartibartfast, hurrying up to them at that point, breathless and agitated, "but there is a reason. Come, we must go. The ancient nightmare is come again. Doom confronts us all. We must leave at once." 
"I fancy somewhere sunny," said Ford. 
Ford and Arthur followed Slartibartfast into the ship and were so perplexed by what they saw inside it that they were totally unaware of what happened next outside. 
A spaceship, yet another one, but this one sleek and silver, descended from the sky on to the pitch, quietly, without fuss, its long legs unlocking in a smooth ballet of technology. 
It landed gently. It extended a short ramp. A tall grey-green figure marched briskly out and approached the small knot of people who were gathered in the centre of the pitch tending to the casualties of the recent bizarre massacre. It moved people aside with quiet, 
understated authority, and came at last to a man lying in a desperate pool of blood, clearly now beyond the reach of any Earthly medicine, breathing, coughing his last. The figure knelt down quietly beside him. 
"Arthur Philip Deodat?" asked the figure. 
The man, with horrified confusion in eyes, nodded feebly. 
"You're a no-good dumbo nothing," whispered the creature. "I thought you should know that before you went." 
Important facts from Galactic history, number two: 
(Reproduced from the Siderial Daily Mentioner's Book of popular Galactic History.) 
Since this Galaxy began, vast civilizations have risen and fallen, risen and fallen, risen and fallen so often that it's quite tempting to think that life in the Galaxy must be: 
(a) something akin to seasick space-sick, time sick, history sick or some such thing, and 
(b) stupid. 
Chapter 4 
It seemed to Arthur as if the whole sky suddenly just stood aside and let them through. 
It seemed to him that the atoms of his brain and the atoms of the cosmos were streaming through each other. 
It seemed to him that he was blown on the wind of the Universe, and that the wind was him. 
It seemed to him that he was one of the thoughts of the Universe and that the Universe was a thought of his. 
It seemed to the people at Lord's Cricket Ground that another North London restaurant had just come and gone as they so often do, and that this was Somebody Else's Problem. 
"What happened?" whispered Arthur in considerable awe. 
"We took off," said Slartibartfast. 
Arthur lay in startled stillness on the acceleration couch. He wasn't certain whether he had just got space-sickness or religion. 
"Nice mover," said Ford in an unsuccessful attempt to disguise the degree to which he had been impressed by what Slartibartfast's ship had just done, "shame about the decor." 
For a moment or two the old man didn't reply. He was staring at the instruments with the air of one who is trying to convert fahrenheit to centigrade in his head whilst his house is burning down. Then his brow cleared and he stared for a moment at the wide panoramic screen in front of him, which displayed a bewildering complexity of stars streaming like silver threads around them. 
His lips moved as if he was trying to spell something. Suddenly his eyes darted in alarm back to his instruments, but then his expression merely subsided into a steady frown. He looked back up at the screen. He felt his own pulse. His frown deepened for a moment, then he relaxed. 
"It's a mistake to try and understand mathematics," he said, "they only worry me. What did you say?" 
"Decor," said Ford. "Pity about it." 
"Deep in the fundamental heart of mind and Universe," said Slartibartfast, "there is a reason." 
Ford glanced sharply around. He clearly thought this was taking an optimistic view of things. 
The interior of the flight deck was dark green, dark red, dark brown, cramped and moodily lit. Inexplicably, the resemblance to a small Italian bistro had failed to end at the hatchway. Small pools of light picked out pot plants, glazed tiles and all sorts of little unidentifiable brass things. 
Rafia-wrapped bottles lurked hideously in the shadows. 
The instruments which had occupied Slartibartfast's attention seemed to be mounted in the bottom of bottles which were set in concrete. 
Ford reached out and touched it. 
Fake concrete. Plastic. Fake bottles set in fake concrete. 
The fundamental heart of mind and Universe can take a running jump, he thought to himself, this is rubbish. On the other hand, it could not be denied that the way the ship had moved made the Heart of Gold seem like an electric pram. 
He swung himself off the couch. He brushed himself down. He looked at Arthur who was singing quietly to himself. He looked at the screen and recognized nothing. He looked at Slartibartfast. 
"How far did we just travel?" he said. 
"About..." said Slartibartfast, "about two thirds of the way across the Galactic disc, I would say, roughly. Yes, roughly two thirds, I think." 
"It's a strange thing," said Arthur quietly, "that the further and faster one travels across the Universe, the more one's position in it seems to be largely immaterial, and one is filled with a profound, or rather emptied of a..." 
"Yes, very strange," said Ford. "Where are we going?" 
"We are going," said Slartibartfast, "to confront an ancient nightmare of the Universe." 
"And where are you going to drop us off?" 
"I will need your help." 
"Tough. Look, there's somewhere you can take us where we can have fun, I'm trying to think of it, we can get drunk and maybe listen to some extremely evil music. Hold on, I'll look it up." He dug out his copy of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and tipped through those parts of the index primarily concerned with sex and drugs and rock and roll. 
"A curse has arisen from the mists of time," said Slartibartfast. 
"Yes, I expect so," said Ford. "Hey," he said, lighting accidentally on one particular reference entry, "Eccentrica Gallumbits, did you ever meet her? The triple-breasted whore of Eroticon Six. Some people say her erogenous zones start some four miles from her actual body. Me, I disagree, I say five." 
"A curse," said Slartibartfast, "which will engulf the Galaxy in fire and destruction, and possibly bring the Universe to a premature doom. I mean it," he added. 
"Sounds like a bad time," said Ford, "with luck I'll be drunk enough not to notice. Here," he said, stabbing his finger at the screen of the Guide, "would be a really wicked place to go, and I think we should. What do you say, Arthur? Stop mumbling mantras and pay attention. There's important stuff you're missing here." 
Arthur pushed himself up from his couch and shook his head. 
"Where are we going?" he said. 
"To confront an ancient night " 
"Can it," said Ford. "Arthur, we are going out into the Galaxy to have some fun. Is that an idea you can cope with?" 
"What's Slartibartfast looking so anxious about?" said Arthur. 
"Nothing," said Ford. 
"Doom," said Slartibartfast. "Come," he added, with sudden authority, "there is much I must show and tell you." 
He walked towards a green wrought-iron spiral staircase set incomprehensibly in the middle of the flight deck and started to ascend. Arthur, with a frown, followed. 
Ford slung the Guide sullenly back into his satchel. 
"My doctor says that I have a malformed public-duty gland and a natural deficiency in moral fibre," he muttered to himself, "and that I am therefore excused from saving Universes." 
Nevertheless, he stomped up the stairs behind them. 
What they found upstairs was just stupid, or so it seemed, and Ford shook his head, buried his face in his hands and slumped against a pot plant, crushing it against the wall. 
"The central computational area," said Slartibartfast unperturbed, "this is where every calculation affecting the ship in any way is performed. Yes I know what it looks like, but it is in fact a complex four-dimensional topographical map of a series of highly complex mathematical functions." 
"It looks like a joke," said Arthur. 
"I know what it looks like," said Slartibartfast, and went into it. As he did so, Arthur had a sudden vague flash of what it might mean, but he refused to believe it. The Universe could not possibly work like that, he thought, cannot possibly. That, he thought to himself, would be as absurd as... he terminated that line of thinking. Most of the really absurd things he could think of had already happened. 
And this was one of them. 
It was a large glass cage, or box-in fact a room. 
In it was a table, a long one. Around it were gathered about aâ¨dozen chairs, of the bentwood style. On it was a tablecloth a grubby, red and white check tablecloth, scarred with the occasional cigarette burn, each, presumably, at a precise calculated mathematical position. 
And on the tablecloth sat some half-eaten Italian meals, hedged about with half-eaten breadsticks and half-drunk glasses of wine, and toyed with listlessly by robots. 
It was all completely artificial. The robot customers were attended by a robot waiter, a robot wine waiter and a robot maetre d'. The furniture was artificial, the tablecloth artificial, and each particular piece of food was clearly capable of exhibiting all the mechanical characteristics of, say, a pollo sorpreso, without actually being one. 
And all participated in a little dance together a complex routine involving the manipulation of menus, bill pads, wallets, cheque books, credit cards, watches, pencils and paper napkins, which seemed to be 
hovering constantly on the edge of violence, but never actually getting anywhere. 
Slartibartfast hurried in, and then appeared to pass the time of day quite idly with the maetre d', whilst one of the customer robots, an autorory, slid slowly under the table, mentioning what he intended to do to some guy over some girl. 
Slartibartfast took over the seat which had been thus vacated and passed a shrewd eye over the menu. The tempo of the routine round the table seemed somehow imperceptibly to quicken. Arguments broke out, people attempted to prove things on napkins. They waved fiercely at each other, and attempted to examine each other's pieces of chicken. The waiter's hand began to move on the bill pad more quickly than a human hand could manage, and then more quickly than a human eye could follow. The pace accelerated. Soon, an extraordinary and insistent politeness overwhelmed the group, and seconds later it seemed that a moment of consensus was suddenly achieved. A new vibration thrilled through the ship. 
Slartibartfast emerged from the glass room. 
"Bistromathics," he said. "The most powerful computational force known to parascience. Come to the Room of Informational Illusions." 
He swept past and carried them bewildered in his wake. 
Chapter 5 
The Bistromatic Drive is a wonderful new method of crossing vast interstellar distances without all that dangerous mucking about with Improbability Factors. 
Bistromathics itself is simply a revolutionary new way of understanding the behaviour of numbers. Just as Einstein observed that time was not an absolute but depended on the observer's movement in space, and that space was not an absolute, but depended on the observer's movement in time, so it is now realized that numbers are not absolute, but depend on the observer's movement in restaurants. 
The first non-absolute number is the number of people for whom the table is reserved. This will vary during the course of the first three telephone calls to the restaurant, and then bear no apparent relation to the number of people who actually turn up, or to the number of people who subsequently join them after the show/match/party/gig, or to the number of people who leave when they see who else has turned up. 
The second non-absolute number is the given time of arrival, which is now known to be one of those most bizarre of mathematical concepts, a recipriversexcluson, a number whose existence can only be defined as being anything other than itself. In other words, the given time of arrival is the one moment of time at which it is impossible that any member of the party will arrive. Recipriversexclusons now play a vital part in many branches of maths, including statistics and accountancy and also form the basic equations used to engineer the Somebody Else's Problem field. 
The third and most mysterious piece of non-absoluteness of all lies in the relationship between the number of items on the bill, the cost of each item, the number of people at the table, and what they are each prepared to pay for. (The number of people who have actually brought any money is only a sub-phenomenon in this field.) 
The baffling discrepancies which used to occur at this point remained uninvestigated for centuries simply because no one took them seriously. They were at the time put down to such things as politeness, rudeness, meanness, flashness, tiredness, emotionality, or the lateness of the hour, and completely forgotten about on the following morning. They were never tested under laboratory conditions, of course, because they never occurred in laboratories not in reputable laboratories at least. 
And so it was only with the advent of pocket computers that the startling truth became finally apparent, and it was this: 
Numbers written on restaurant bills within the confines of restaurants do not follow the same mathematical laws as numbers written on any other pieces of paper in any other parts of the Universe. 
This single fact took the scientific world by storm. It completely revolutionized it. So many mathematical conferences got held in such good restaurants that many of the finest minds of a generation died of obesity and heart failure and the science of maths was put back by years. 
Slowly, however, the implications of the idea began to be understood. To begin with it had been too stark, too crazy, too much what the man in the street would have said, "Oh yes, I could have told you that," about. Then some phrases like "Interactive Subjectivity Frameworks" were invented, and everybody was able to relax and get on with it. 
The small groups of monks who had taken up hanging around the major research institutes singing strange chants to the effect that the Universe was only a figment of its own imagination were eventually given a street theatre grant and went away. 
Chapter 6 
"In space travel, you see," said Slartibartfast, as he fiddled with some instruments in the Room of Informational Illusions, "in space travel..." 
He stopped and looked about him. 
The Room of Informational Illusions was a welcome relief after the visual monstrosities of the central computational area. There was nothing in it. No information, no illusions, just themselves, white walls and a few small instruments which looked as if they were meant to plug into something which Slartibartfast couldn't find. 
"Yes?" urged Arthur. He had picked up Slartibartfast's sense of urgency but didn't know what to do with it. 
"Yes what?" said the old man.â¨"You were saying?"â¨Slartibartfast looked at him sharply.â¨"The numbers," he said, "are awful." He resumed his search. 
Arthur nodded wisely to himself. After a while he realized that this wasn't getting him anywhere and decided that he would say "what?" after all. 
"In space travel," repeated Slartibartfast, "all the numbers are awful." 
Arthur nodded again and looked round to Ford for help, but Ford was practising being sullen and getting quite good at it. 
"I was only," said Slartibartfast with a sigh, "trying to save you the trouble of asking me why all the ship's computations were being done on a waiter's bill pad." 
Arthur frowned. 
"Why," he said, "were all the ship's computations being done on a wait " 
He stopped. 
Slartibartfast said, "Because in space travel all the numbers are awful." 
He could tell that he wasn't getting his point across. 
"Listen," he said. "On a waiter's bill pad numbers dance. You must have encountered the phenomenon." 
"Well..." 
"On a waiter's bill pad," said Slartibartfast, "reality and unreality collide on such a fundamental level that each becomes the other and anything is possible, within certain parameters." 
"What parameters?" 
"It's impossible to say," said Slartibartfast. "That's one of them. Strange but true. At least, I think it's strange," he added, "and I'm assured that it's true." 
At that moment he located the slot in the wall for which he had been searching, and clicked the instrument he was holding into it. 
"Do not be alarmed," he said, and then suddenly darted an alarmed look at himself, and lunged back, "it's..." 
They didn't hear what he said, because at that moment the ship winked out of existence around them and a starbattle-ship the size of a small Midlands industrial city plunged out of the sundered night towards them, star lasers ablaze. 
They gaped, pop-eyed, and were unable to scream. 
Chapter 7 
Another world, another day, another dawn. 
The early morning's thinnest sliver of light appeared silently. 
Several billion trillion tons of superhot exploding hydrogen nuclei rose slowly above the horizon and managed to look small, cold and slightly damp. 
There is a moment in every dawn when light floats, there is the possibility of magic. Creation holds its breath. 
The moment passed as it regularly did on Squornshellous Zeta, without incident. 
The mist clung to the surface of the marshes. The swamp trees were grey with it, the tall reeds indistinct. It hung motionless like held breath. 
Nothing moved. 
There was silence. 
The sun struggled feebly with the mist, tried to impart a little warmth here, shed a little light there, but clearly today was going to be just another long haul across the sky. 
Nothing moved. Again, silence. Nothing moved. Silence. 
Very often on Squornshellous Zeta, whole days would go on like this, and this was indeed going to be one of them. 
Fourteen hours later the sun sank hopelessly beneath the opposite horizon with a sense of totally wasted effort. 
And a few hours later it reappeared, squared its shoulders and started on up the sky again. 
This time, however, something was happening. A mattress had just met a robot. 
"Hello, robot," said the mattress. 
"Bleah," said the robot and continued what it was doing, which was walking round very slowly in a very tiny circle. 
"Happy?" said the mattress. 
The robot stopped and looked at the mattress. It looked at it quizzically. It was clearly a very stupid mattress. It looked back at him with wide eyes. 
After what it had calculated to ten significant decimal places as being the precise length of pause most likely to convey a general contempt for all things mattressy, the robot continued to walk round in tight circles. 
"We could have a conversation," said the mattress, "would you like that?" 
It was a large mattress, and probably one of quite high quality.â¨Very few things actually get manufactured these days, because in an infinitely large Universe such as, for instance, the one in which we live, most things one could possibly imagine, and a lot of things one would rather not, grow somewhere. A forest was discovered recently in which most of the trees grew ratchet screwdrivers as fruit. The life cycle of ratchet screwdriver fruit it quite interesting. Once picked it needs a dark dusty drawer in which it can lie undisturbed for years. Then one night it suddenly hatches, discards its outer skin which crumbles into dust, and emerges as a totally unidentifiable little metal object with flanges at both ends and a sort of ridge and a sort of hole for a screw. This, when found, will get thrown away. No one knows what it is supposed to gain from this. Nature, in her infinite wisdom, is presumably working on it. 
No one really knows what mattresses are meant to gain from their lives either. They are large, friendly, pocket-sprung creatures which live quiet private lives in the marshes of Squornshellous Zeta. Many of them get caught, slaughtered, dried out, shipped out and slept on. None of them seem to mind and all of them are called Zem. 
"No," said Marvin. 
"My name," said the mattress, "is Zem. We could discuss the weather a little." 
Marvin paused again in his weary circular plod. 
"The dew," he observed, "has clearly fallen with a particularly sickening thud this morning." 
He resumed his walk, as if inspired by this conversational outburst to fresh heights of gloom and despondency. He plodded tenaciously. If he had had teeth he would have gritted them at this point. He hadn't. He didn't. The mere plod said it all. 
The mattress flolloped around. This is a thing that only live mattresses in swamps are able to do, which is why the word is not in more common usage. It flolloped in a sympathetic sort of way, moving a fairish body of water as it did so. It blew a few bubbles up through the water engagingly. Its blue and white stripes glistened briefly in a sudden feeble ray of sun that had unexpectedly made it through the mist, causing the creature to bask momentarily. 
Marvin plodded. 
"You have something on your mind, I think," said the mattress floopily. 
"More than you can possibly imagine," dreaded Marvin. "My capacity for mental activity of all kinds is as boundless as the infinite reaches of space itself. Except of course for my capacity for happiness." 
Stomp, stomp, he went. 
"My capacity for happiness," he added, "you could fit into a matchbox without taking out the matches first." 
The mattress globbered. This is the noise made by a live, swamp- dwelling mattress that is deeply moved by a story of personal tragedy. The word can also, according to the Ultra-Complete Maximegalon Dictionary of Every Language Ever, mean the noise made by the Lord High Sanvalvwag of Hollop on discovering that he has forgotten his wife's birthday for the second year running. Since there was only ever one Lord High Sanvalvwag of Hollop, and he never married, the word is only ever used in a negative or speculative sense, and there is an ever-increasing body of opinion which holds that the Ultra-Complete Maximegalon Dictionary is not worth the fleet of lorries it takes to cart its microstored edition around in. Strangely enough, the dictionary omits the word "floopily", which simply means "in the manner of something which is floopy". 
The mattress globbered again. 
"I sense a deep dejection in your diodes," it vollued (for the meaning of the word "vollue", buy a copy of Squornshellous Swamptalk at any remaindered bookshop, or alternatively buy the Ultra-Complete Maximegalon Dictionary, as the University will be very glad to get it off their hands and regain some valuable parking lots), "and it saddens me. You should be more mattresslike. We live quiet retired lives in the swamp, where we are content to flollop and vollue and regard the wetness in a fairly floopy manner. Some of us are killed, but all of us are called Zem, so we never know which and globbering is thus kept to a minimum. Why are you walking in circles?" 
"Because my leg is stuck," said Marvin simply. 
"It seems to me," said the mattress eyeing it compassionately, "that it is a pretty poor sort of leg." 
"You are right," said Marvin, "it is." 
"Voon," said the mattress. 
"I expect so," said Marvin, "and I also expect that you find the idea of a robot with an artificial leg pretty amusing. You should tell your friends Zem and Zem when you see them later; they'll laugh, if I know them, which I don't of course except insofar as I know all organic life forms, which is much better than I would wish to. Ha, but my life is but a box of wormgears." 
He stomped around again in his tiny circle, around his thin steel peg-leg which revolved in the mud but seemed otherwise stuck. 
"But why do you just keep walking round and round?" said the mattress. 
"Just to make the point," said Marvin, and continued, round and round. 
"Consider it made, my dear friend," flurbled the mattress, "consider it made." 
"Just another million years," said Marvin, "just another quick million. Then I might try it backwards. Just for the variety, you understand." 
The mattress could feel deep in his innermost spring pockets that the robot dearly wished to be asked how long he had been trudging in this futile and fruitless manner, and with another quiet flurble he did so. 
"Oh, just over the one-point-five-million mark, just over," said Marvin airily. "Ask me if I ever get bored, go on, ask me." 
The mattress did. 
Marvin ignored the question, he merely trudged with added emphasis. 
"I gave a speech once," he said suddenly, and apparently unconnectedly. "You may not instantly see why I bring the subject up, but that is because my mind works so phenomenally fast, and I am at a rough estimate thirty billion times more intelligent than you. Let me give you an example. Think of a number, any number." 
"Er, five," said the mattress. 
"Wrong," said Marvin. "You see?" 
The mattress was much impressed by this and realized that it was in the presence of a not unremarkable mind. It willomied along its entire length, sending excited little ripples through its shallow algae- covered pool. 
It gupped. 
"Tell me," it urged, "of the speech you once made, I long to hear it." 
"It was received very badly," said Marvin, "for a variety of reasons. I delivered it," he added, pausing to make an awkward humping sort of gesture with his not-exactly-good arm, but his arm which was better than the other one which was dishearteningly welded to his left side, "over there, about a mile distance." 
He was pointing as well as he could manage, and he obviously wanted to make it totally clear that this was as well as he could manage, through the mist, over the reeds, to a part of the marsh which looked exactly the same as every other part of the marsh. 
"There," he repeated. "I was somewhat of a celebrity at the time." 
Excitement gripped the mattress. It had never heard of speeches being delivered on Squornshellous Zeta, and certainly not by celebrities. Water spattered off it as a thrill glurried across its back. 
It did something which mattresses very rarely bother to do. Summoning every bit of its strength, it reared its oblong body, heaved it up into the air and held it quivering there for a few seconds whilst it peered through the mist over the reeds at the part of the marsh which Marvin had indicated, observing, without disappointment, that 
it was exactly the same as every other part of the marsh. The effort was too much, and it flodged back into its pool, deluging Marvin with smelly mud, moss and weeds. 
"I was a celebrity," droned the robot sadly, "for a short while on account of my miraculous and bitterly resented escape from a fate almost as good as death in the heart of a blazing sun. You can guess from my condition," he added, "how narrow my escape was. I was rescued by a scrap-metal merchant, imagine that. Here I am, brain the size of... never mind." 
He trudged savagely for a few seconds. 
"He it was who fixed me up with this leg. Hateful, isn't it? He sold me to a Mind Zoo. I was the star exhibit. I had to sit on a box and tell my story whilst people told me to cheer up and think positive. 'Give us a grin, little robot,' they would shout at me, 'give us a little chuckle.' I would explain to them that to get my face to grin would take a good couple of hours in a workshop with a wrench, and that went down very well." 
"The speech," urged the mattress. "I long to hear of the speech you gave in the marshes." 
"There was a bridge built across the marshes. A cyberstructured hyperbridge, hundreds of miles in length, to carry ion-buggies and freighters over the swamp." 
"A bridge?" quirruled the mattress. "Here in the swamp?" 
"A bridge," confirmed Marvin, "here in the swamp. It was going to revitalize the economy of the Squornshellous System. They spent the entire economy of the Squornshellous System building it. They asked me to open it. Poor fools." 
It began to rain a little, a fine spray slid through the mist. 
"I stood on the platform. For hundreds of miles in front of me, and hundreds of miles behind me, the bridge stretched." 
"Did it glitter?" enthused the mattress.â¨"It glittered."â¨"Did it span the miles majestically?"â¨"It spanned the miles majestically."â¨"Did it stretch like a silver thread far out into the invisible mist?" "Yes," said Marvin. "Do you want to hear this story?" 
"I want to hear your speech," said the mattress. 
"This is what I said. I said, 'I would like to say that it is a very great pleasure, honour and privilege for me to open this bridge, but I can't because my lying circuits are all out of commission. I hate and despise you all. I now declare this hapless cyberstructure open to the unthinkable abuse of all who wantonly cross her.' And I plugged myself into the opening circuits." 
Marvin paused, remembering the moment. 
The mattress flurred and glurried. It flolloped, gupped and willomied, doing this last in a particularly floopy way. 
"Voon," it wurfed at last. "And it was a magnificent occasion?" 
"Reasonably magnificent. The entire thousand-mile-long bridge spontaneously folded up its glittering spans and sank weeping into the mire, taking everybody with it." 
There was a sad and terrible pause at this point in the conversation during which a hundred thousand people seemed unexpectedly to say "wop" and a team of white robots descended from the sky like dandelion seeds drifting on the wind in tight military formation. For a sudden violent moment they were all there, in the swamp, wrenching Marvin's false leg off, and then they were gone again in their ship, which said "foop". 
"You see the sort of thing I have to contend with?" said Marvin to the gobbering mattress. 
Suddenly, a moment later, the robots were back again for another violent incident, and this time when they left, the mattress was alone in the swamp. He flolloped around in astonishment and alarm. He almost lurgled in fear. He reared himself to see over the reeds, but there was nothing to see, just more reeds. He listened, but there was no sound on the wind beyond the now familiar sound of half-crazed etymologists calling distantly to each other across the sullen mire. 
Chapter 8 
The body of Arthur Dent span. 
The Universe shattered into a million glittering fragments around it, and each particular shard span silently through the void, reflecting on its silver surface some single searing holocaust of fire and destruction. 
And then the blackness behind the Universe exploded, and each particular piece of blackness was the furious smoke of hell. 
And the nothingness behind the blackness behind the Universe erupted, and behind the nothingness behind the blackness behind the shattered Universe was at last the dark figure of an immense man speaking immense words. 
"These, then," said the figure, speaking from an immensely comfortable chair, "were the Krikkit Wars, the greatest devastation ever visited upon our Galaxy. What you have experienced..." 
Slartibartfast floated past, waving. 
"It's just a documentary," he called out. "This is not a good bit. Terribly sorry, trying to find the rewind control..." 
"... is what billions of billions of innocent..." 
"Do not," called out Slartibartfast floating past again, and fiddling furiously with the thing that he had stuck into the wall of the Room of Informational Illusions and which was in fact still stuck there, "agree to buy anything at this point." 
"... people, creatures, your fellow beings..." 
Music swelled again, it was immense music, immense chords. And behind the man, slowly, three tall pillars began to emerge out of the immensely swirling mist. 
"... experienced, lived through or, more often, failed to live through. Think of that, my friends. And let us not forget and in just a moment I shall be able to suggest a way which will help us always to remember that before the Krikkit Wars, the Galaxy was that rare and wonderful thing a happy Galaxy!" 
The music was going bananas with immensity at this point. 
"A Happy Galaxy, my friends, as represented by the symbol of the Wikkit Gate!" 
The three pillars stood out clearly now, three pillars topped with two cross pieces in a way which looked stupefyingly familiar to Arthur's addled brain. 
"The three pillars," thundered the man. "The Steel Pillar which represented the Strength and Power of the Galaxy!" 
Searchlights seared out and danced crazy dances up and down the pillar on the left which was, clearly, made of steel or something very like it. The music thumped and bellowed. 
"The Perspex Pillar," announced the man, "representing the forces of Science and Reason in the Galaxy!" 
Other searchlights played exotically up and down the righthand, transparent pillar creating dazzling patterns within it and a sudden inexplicable craving for ice-cream in the stomach of Arthur Dent. 
"And," the thunderous voice continued, "the Wooden Pillar, representing..." and here his voice became just very slightly hoarse with wonderful sentiments, "the forces of Nature and Spirituality." 
The lights picked out the central pillar. The music moved bravely up into the realms of complete unspeakability. 
"Between them supporting," the voice rolled on, approaching its climax, "the Golden Bail of Prosperity and the Silver Bail of Peace!" 
The whole structure was now flooded with dazzling lights, and the music had now, fortunately, gone far beyond the limits of the discernible. At the top of the three pillars the two brilliantly gleaming bails sat and dazzled. There seemed to be girls sitting on top of them, or maybe they were meant to be angels. Angels are usually represented as wearing more than that, though. 
Suddenly there was a dramatic hush in what was presumably meant to be the Cosmos, and a darkening of the lights. 
"There is not a world," thrilled the man's expert voice, "not a civilized world in the Galaxy where this symbol is not revered even today. Even in primitive worlds it persists in racial memories. This it was that the forces of Krikkit destroyed, and this it is that now locks their world away till the end of eternity!" 
And with a flourish, the man produced in his hands a model of the Wikkit gate. Scale was terribly hard to judge in this whole extraordinary spectacle, but the model looked as if it must have been about three feet high. 
"Not the original key, of course. That, as everyone knows, was destroyed, blasted into the ever-whirling eddies of the space-time continuum and lost for ever. This is a remarkable replica, hand-tooled by skilled craftsmen, lovingly assembled using ancient craft secrets into a memento you will be proud to own, in memory of those who fell, and in tribute to the Galaxy our Galaxy which they died to defend..." 
Slartibartfast floated past again at this moment. 
"Found it," he said. "We can lose all this rubbish. Just don't nod, that's all." 
"Now, let us bow our heads in payment," intoned the voice, and then said it again, much faster and backwards. 
Lights came and went, the pillars disappeared, the man gabled himself backwards into nothing, the Universe snappily reassembled itself around them. 
"You get the gist?" said Slartibartfast. 
"I'm astonished," said Arthur, "and bewildered." 
"I was asleep," said Ford, who floated into view at this point. "Did I miss anything?" 
They found themselves once again teetering rather rapidly on the edge of an agonizingly high cliff. The wind whipped out from their faces and across a bay on which the remains of one of the greatest and most powerful space battle-fleets ever assembled in the Galaxy was briskly burning itself back into existence. The sky was a sullen pink, darkening via a rather curious colour to blue and upwards to black. Smoke billowed down out of it at an incredible lick. 
Events were now passing back by them almost too quickly to be distinguished, and when, a short while later, a huge starbattle-ship rushed away from them as if they'd said "boo", they only just recognized it as the point at which they had come in. 
But now things were too rapid, a video-tactile blur which brushed and jiggled them through centuries of galactic history, turning, twisting, flickering. The sound was a mere thin thrill. 
Periodically through the thickening jumble of events they sensed appalling catastrophes, deep horrors, cataclysmic shocks, and these were always associated with certain recurring images, the only images which ever stood out clearly from the avalance of tumbling history: a wicket gate, a small hard red ball, hard white robots, and also something less distinct, something dark and cloudy. 
But there was also another sensation which rose clearly out of the thrilling passage of time. 
Just as a slow series of clicks when speeded up will lose the definition of each individual click and gradually take on the quality of a sustained and rising tone, so a series of individual impressions here took on the quality of a sustained emotion and yet not an emotion. If it was an emotion, it was a totally emotionless one. It was hatred, implacable hatred. It was cold, not like ice is cold, but like a wall is cold. It was impersonal, not as a randomly flung fist in a crowd is impersonal, but like a computer-issued parking summons is impersonal. And it was deadly again, not like a bullet or a knife is deadly, but like a brick wall across a motorway is deadly. 
And just as a rising tone will change in character and take on harmonics as it rises, so again, this emotionless emotion seemed to rise to an unbearable if unheard scream and suddenly seemed to be a scream of guilt and failure. 
And suddenly it stopped. 
They were left standing on a quiet hilltop on a tranquil evening. 
The sun was setting. 
All around them softly undulating green countryside rolled off gently into the distance. Birds sang about what they thought of it all, and the general opinion seemed to be good. A little way away could be heard the sound of children playing, and a little further away than the apparent source of that sound could be seen in the dimming evening light the outlines of a small town. 
The town appeared to consist mostly of fairly low buildings made of white stone. The skyline was of gentle pleasing curves. 
The sun had nearly set. 
As if out of nowhere, music began. Slartibartfast tugged at a switch and it stopped. 
A voice said, "This..." Slartibartfast tugged at a switch and it stopped. 
"I will tell you about it," he said quietly. 
The place was peaceful. Arthur felt happy. Even Ford seemed cheerful. They walked a short way in the direction of the town, and the Informational Illusion of the grass was pleasant and springy under their feet, and the Informational Illusion of the flowers smelt sweet and fragrant. Only Slartibartfast seemed apprehensive and out of sorts. 
He stopped and looked up. 
It suddenly occurred to Arthur that, coming as this did at the end, so to speak, or rather the beginning of all the horror they had just blurredly experienced, something nasty must be about to happen. He was distressed to think that something nasty could happen to somewhere as idyllic as this. He too glanced up. There was nothing in the sky. 
"They're not about to attack here, are they?" he said. He realized that this was merely a recording he was walking through, but he still felt alarmed. 
"Nothing is about to attack here," said Slartibartfast in a voice which unexpectedly trembled with emotion. "This is where it all started. This is the place itself. This is Krikkit." 
He stared up into the sky. 
The sky, from one horizon to another, from east to west, from north to south, was utterly and completely black. 
Chapter 9 
Stomp stomp. 
Whirrr. 
"Pleased to be of service." 
"Shut up." 
"Thank you." 
Stomp stomp stomp stomp stomp. 
Whirrr. 
"Thank you for making a simple door very happy." 
"Hope your diodes rot." 
"Thank you. Have a nice day." 
Stomp stomp stomp stomp. 
Whirrr. 
"It is my pleasure to open for you..." 
"Zark off." 
"... and my satisfaction to close again with the knowledge of a job well done." 
"I said zark off."â¨"Thank you for listening to this message." Stomp stomp stomp stomp.â¨"Wop." 
Zaphod stopped stomping. He had been stomping around theâ¨Heart of Gold for days, and so far no door had said "wop" to him. He was fairly certain that no door had said "wop" to him now. It was not the sort of thing doors said. Too concise. Furthermore, there were not enough doors. It sounded as if a hundred thousand people had said "wop", which puzzled him because he was the only person on the ship. 
It was dark. Most of the ship's non-essential systems were closed down. It was drifting in a remote area of the Galaxy, deep in the inky 
blackness of space. So which particular hundred thousand people would turn up at this point and say a totally unexpected "wop"? 
He looked about him, up the corridor and down the corridor. It was all in deep shadow. There were just the very dim pinkish outlines of the doors which glowed in the dark and pulsed whenever they spoke, though he had tried every way he could think of stopping them. 
The lights were off so that his heads could avoid looking at each other, because neither of them was currently a particularly engaging sight, and nor had they been since he had made the error of looking into his soul. 
It had indeed been an error. It had been late one night of course. 
It had been a difficult day of course. 
There had been soulful music playing on the ship's sound system of course. 
And he had, of course, been slightly drunk. 
In other words, all the usual conditions which bring on a bout of soul-searching had applied, but it had, nevertheless, clearly been an error. 
Standing now, silent and alone in the dark corridor he remembered the moment and shivered. His one head looked one way and his other the other and each decided that the other was the way to go. 
He listened but could hear nothing. 
All there had been was the "wop". 
It seemed an awfully long way to bring an awfully large number of people just to say one word. 
He started nervously to edge his way in the direction of the bridge. There at least he would feel in control. He stopped again. The way he was feeling he didn't think he was an awfully good person to be in control. 
The first shock of that moment, thinking back, had been discovering that he actually had a soul. 
In fact he'd always more or less assumed that he had one as he had a full complement of everything else, and indeed two of somethings, but suddenly actually to encounter the thing lurking there deep within him had giving him a severe jolt. 
And then to discover (this was the second shock) that it wasn't the totally wonderful object which he felt a man in his position had a natural right to expect had jolted him again. 
Then he had thought about what his position actually was and the renewed shock had nearly made him spill his drink. He drained it quickly before anything serious happened to it. He then had another quick one to follow the first one down and check that it was all right. 
"Freedom," he said aloud. 
Trillian came on to the bridge at that point and said several enthusiastic things on the subject of freedom. 
"I can't cope with it," he said darkly, and sent a third drink down to see why the second hadn't yet reported on the condition of the first. He looked uncertainly at both of her and preferred the one on the right. 
He poured a drink down his other throat with the plan that it would head the previous one off at the pass, join forces with it, and together they would get the second to pull itself together. Then all three would go off in search of the first, give it a good talking to and maybe a bit of a sing as well. 
He felt uncertain as to whether the fourth drink had understood all that, so he sent down a fifth to explain the plan more fully and a sixth for moral support. 
"You're drinking too much," said Trillian. 
His heads collided trying to sort out the four of her he could now see into a whole position. He gave up and looked at the navigation screen and was astonished to see a quite phenomenal number of stars. 
"Excitement and adventure and really wild things," he muttered. 
"Look," she said in a sympathetic tone of voice, and sat down near him, "it's quite understandable that you're going to feel a little aimless for a bit." 
He boggled at her. He had never seen anyone sit on their own lap before. 
"Wow," he said. He had another drink.â¨"You've finished the mission you've been on for years." "I haven't been on it. I've tried to avoid being on it." 
"You've still finished it." 
He grunted. There seemed to be a terrific party going on in his stomach. 
"I think it finished me," he said. "Here I am, Zaphod Beeblebrox, I can go anywhere, do anything. I have the greatest ship in the know sky, a girl with whom things seem to be working out pretty well..." 
"Are they?" 
"As far as I can tell I'm not an expert in personal relationships..." 
Trillian raised her eyebrows. 
"I am," he added, "one hell of a guy, I can do anything I want only I just don't have the faintest idea what." 
He paused. 
"One thing," he further added, "has suddenly ceased to lead to another" in contradiction of which he had another drink and slid gracelessly off his chair. 
Whilst he slept it off, Trillian did a little research in the ship's copy of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It had some advice to offer on drunkenness. 
"Go to it," it said, "and good luck." 
It was cross-referenced to the entry concerning the size of the Universe and ways of coping with that. 
Then she found the entry on Han Wavel, an exotic holiday planet, and one of the wonders of the Galaxy. 
Han Wavel is a world which consists largely of fabulous ultra-luxury hotels and casinos, all of which have been formed by the natural erosion of wind and rain. 
The chances of this happening are more or less one to infinity against. Little is known of how this came about because none of the geophysicists, probability statisticians, meteoranalysts or bizzarrologists who are so keen to research it can afford to stay there. 
Terrific, thought Trillian to herself, and within a few hours the great white running-shoe ship was slowly powering down out of the sky beneath a hot brilliant sun towards a brightly coloured sandy spaceport. The ship was clearly causing a sensation on the ground, and Trillian was enjoying herself. She heard Zaphod moving around and whistling somewhere in the ship. 
"How are you?" she said over the general intercom. "Fine," he said brightly, "terribly well."â¨"Where are you?"â¨"In the bathroom." 
"What are you doing?" 
"Staying here." 
After an hour or two it became plain that he meant it and the ship returned to the sky without having once opened its hatchway. 
"Heigh ho," said Eddie the Computer. 
Trillian nodded patiently, tapped her fingers a couple of times and pushed the intercom switch. 
"I think that enforced fun is probably not what you need at this point." 
"Probably not," replied Zaphod from wherever he was. 
"I think a bit of physical challenge would help draw you out of yourself." 
"Whatever you think, I think," said Zaphod. 
"RECREATIONAL IMPOSSIBILITIES" was a heading which caught Trillian's eye when, a short while later, she sat down to flip through the Guide again, and as the Heart of Gold rushed at improbable speeds in an indeterminate direction, she sipped a cup of something undrinkable from the Nutrimatic Drink Dispenser and read about how to fly. 
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has this to say on the subject of flying. 
There is an art, it says, or rather a knack to flying. 
The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss. 
Pick a nice day, it suggests, and try it. 
The first part is easy. 
All it requires is simply the ability to throw yourself forward with all your weight, and the willingness not to mind that it's going to hurt. 
That is, it's going to hurt if you fail to miss the ground. 
Most people fail to miss the ground, and if they are really trying properly, the likelihood is that they will fail to miss it fairly hard. 
Clearly, it's the second point, the missing, which presents the difficulties. 
One problem is that you have to miss the ground accidentally. It's no good deliberately intending to miss the ground because you won't. You have to have your attention suddenly distracted by something else when you're halfway there, so that you are no longer thinking about falling, or about the ground, or about how much it's going to hurt if you fail to miss it. 
It is notoriously difficult to prise your attention away from these three things during the split second you have at your disposal. Hence most people's failure, and their eventual disillusionment with this exhilarating and spectacular sport. 
If, however, you are lucky enough to have your attention momentarily distracted at the crucial moment by, say, a gorgeous pair of legs (tentacles, pseudopodia, according to phyllum and/or personal inclination) or a bomb going off in your vicinity, or by suddenly spotting an extremely rare species of beetle crawling along a nearby twig, then in your astonishment you will miss the ground completely and remain bobbing just a few inches above it in what might seem to be a slightly foolish manner. 
This is a moment for superb and delicate concentration. 
Bob and float, float and bob. 
Ignore all considerations of your own weight and simply let yourself waft higher. 
Do not listen to what anybody says to you at this point because they are unlikely to say anything helpful. 
They are most likely to say something along the lines of, "Good God, you can't possibly be flying!" 
It is vitally important not to believe them or they will suddenly be right. 
Waft higher and higher. 
Try a few swoops, gentle ones at first, then drift above the treetops breathing regularly. 
DO NOT WAVE AT ANYBODY. 
When you have done this a few times you will find the moment of distraction rapidly becomes easier and easier to achieve. 
You will then learn all sorts of things about how to control your flight, your speed, your manoeuvrability, and the trick usually lies in not thinking too hard about whatever you want to do, but just allowing it to happen as if it was going to anyway. 
You will also learn how to land properly, which is something you will almost certainly cock up, and cock up badly, on your first attempt. 
There are private flying clubs you can join which help you achieve the all-important moment of distraction. They hire people with surprising bodies or opinions to leap out from behind bushes and exhibit and/or explain them at the crucial moments. Few genuine hitch-hikers will be able to afford to join these clubs, but some may be able to get temporary employment at them. 
Trillian read this longingly, but reluctantly decided that Zaphod wasn't really in the right frame of mind for attempting to fly, or for walking through mountains or for trying to get the Brantisvogan Civil Service to acknowledge a change-of-address card, which were the other things listed under the heading "RECREATIONAL IMPOSSIBILITIES". 
Instead, she flew the ship to Allosimanius Syneca, a world of ice, snow, mind-hurtling beauty and stunning cold. The trek from the snow plains of Liska to the summit of the Ice Crystal Pyramids of Sastantua is long and gruelling, even with jet skis and a team of Syneca Snowhounds, but the view from the top, a view which takes in the Stin Glacier Fields, the shimmering Prism Mountains and the far ethereal dancing icelights, is one which first freezes the mind and then slowly releases it to hitherto unexperienced horizons of beauty, and Trillian, for one, felt that she could do with a bit of having her mind slowly released to hitherto unexperienced horizons of beauty. 
They went into a low orbit. 
There lay the silverwhite beauty of Allosimanius Syneca beneath them. 
Zaphod stayed in bed with one head stuck under a pillow and the other doing crosswords till late into the night. 
Trillian nodded patiently again, counted to a sufficiently high number, and told herself that the important thing now was just to get Zaphod talking. 
She prepared, by dint of deactivating all the robot kitchen synthomatics, the most fabulously delicious meal she could contrive delicately oiled meals, scented fruits, fragrant cheeses, fine Aldebaran wines. 
She carried it through to him and asked if he felt like talking things through. 
"Zark off," said Zaphod. 
Trillian nodded patiently to herself, counted to an even higher number, tossed the tray lightly aside, walked to the transport room and just teleported herself the hell out of his life. 
She didn't even programme any coordinates, she hadn't the faintest idea where she was going, she just went a random row of dots flowing through the Universe. 
"Anything," she said to herself as she left, "is better than this." 
"Good job too," muttered Zaphod to himself, turned over and failed to go to sleep. 
The next day he restlessly paced the empty corridors of the ship, pretending not to look for her, though he knew she wasn't there. He ignored the computer's querulous demands to know just what the hell was going on around here by fitting a small electronic gag across a pair of its terminals. 
After a while he began to turn down the lights. There was nothing to see. Nothing was about to happen. 
Lying in bed one night and night was now virtually continuous on the ship he decided to pull himself together, to get things into some kind of perspective. He sat up sharply and started to pull clothes on. He decided that there must be someone in the Universe feeling more wretched, miserable and forsaken than himself, and he determined to set out and find him. 
Halfway to the bridge it occurred to him that it might be Marvin, and he returned to bed. 
It was a few hours later than this, as he stomped disconsolately about the darkened corridors swearing at cheerful doors, that he heard the "wop" said, and it made him very nervous. 
He leant tensely against the corridor wall and frowned like a man trying to unbend a corkscrew by telekinesis. He laid his fingertips against the wall and felt an unusual vibration. And now he could quite 
clearly hear slight noises, and could hear where they were coming from they were coming from the bridge. 
"Computer?" he hissed.â¨"Mmmm?" said the computer terminal nearest him, equally quietly. "Is there someone on this ship?"â¨"Mmmmm," said the computer.â¨"Who is it?"â¨Mmmmm mmm mmmmm," said the computer.â¨"What?"â¨"Mmmmm mmmm mm mmmmmmmm."â¨Zaphod buried one of his faces in two of his hands. 
"Oh, Zarquon," he muttered to himself. Then he stared up the corridor towards the entrance to the bridge in the dim distance from which more and purposeful noises were coming, and in which the gagged terminals were situated. 
"Computer," he hissed again. "Mmmmm?"â¨"When I ungag you..." "Mmmmm." 
"Remind me to punch myself in the mouth." 
"Mmmmm mmm?" 
"Either one. Now just tell me this. One for yes, two for no. Is it dangerous?" 
"Mmmmm."â¨"It is?"â¨"Mmmm."â¨"You didn't just go 'mmmm' twice?" "Mmmm mmmm." 
"Hmmmm." 
He inched his way up the corridor as if he would rather be yarding his way down it, which was true. 
He was within two yards of the door to the bridge when he suddenly realized to his horror that it was going to be nice to him, and he stopped dead. He hadn't been able to turn off the doors' courtesy voice circuits. 
This doorway to the bridge was concealed from view within it because of the excitingly chunky way in which the bridge had been designed to curve round, and he had been hoping to enter unobserved. 
He leant despondently back against the wall again and said some words which his other head was quite shocked to hear. 
He peered at the dim pink outline of the door, and discovered that in the darkness of the corridor he could just about make out the Sensor Field which extended out into the corridor and told the door when there was someone there for whom it must open and to whom it must make a cheery and pleasant remark. 
He pressed himself hard back against the wall and edged himself towards the door, flattening his chest as much as he possibly could to avoid brushing against the very, very dim perimeter of the field. He held his breath, and congratulated himself on having lain in bed sulking for the last few days rather than trying to work out his feelings on chest expanders in the ship's gym. 
He then realized he was going to have to speak at this point. 
He took a series of very shallow breaths, and then said as quickly and as quietly as he could, "Door, if you can hear me, say so very, very quietly." 
Very, very quietly, the door murmured, "I can hear you." 
"Good. Now, in a moment, I'm going to ask you to open. When you open I do not want you to say that you enjoyed it, OK?" 
"OK." 
"And I don't want you to say to me that I have made a simple door very happy, or that it is your pleasure to open for me and your satisfaction to close again with the knowledge of a job well done, OK?" 
"OK." 
"And I do not want you to ask me to have a nice day, understand?" 
"I understand." 
"OK," said Zaphod, tensing himself, "open now." 
The door slid open quietly. Zaphod slipped quietly through. The door closed quietly behind him. 
"Is that the way you like it, Mr. Beeblebrox?" said the door out loud. 
"I want you to imagine," said Zaphod to the group of white robots who swung round to stare at him at that point, "that I have an extremely powerful Kill-O-Zap blaster pistol in my hand." 
There was an immensely cold and savage silence. The robots regarded him with hideously dead eyes. They stood very still. There was something intensely macabre about their appearance, especially to Zaphod who had never seen one before or even known anything about them. The Krikkit Wars belonged to the ancient past of the Galaxy, and Zaphod had spent most of his early history lessons plotting how he was going to have sex with the girl in the cybercubicle next to him, and since his teaching computer had been an integral part of this plot it had eventually had all its history circuits wiped and replaced with an entirely different set of ideas which had then resulted in it being scrapped and sent to a home for Degenerate Cybermats, whither it was followed by the girl who had inadvertently fallen deeply in love with the unfortunate machine, with the result (a) that Zaphod never got near her and (b) that he missed out on a period of ancient history that would have been of inestimable value to him at this moment. 
He stared at them in shock. 
It was impossible to explain why, but their smooth and sleek white bodies seemed to be the utter embodiment of clean, clinical evil. From their hideously dead eyes to their powerful lifeless feet, they were clearly the calculated product of a mind that wanted simply to kill. Zaphod gulped in cold fear. 
They had been dismantling part of the rear bridge wall, and had forced a passage through some of the vital innards of the ship. Through the tangled wreckage Zaphod could see, with a further and worse sense of shock, that they were tunnelling towards the very heart of the ship, the heart of the Improbability Drive that had been so mysteriously created out of thin air, the Heart of Gold itself. 
The robot closest to him was regarding him in such a way as to suggest that it was measuring every smallest particle of his body, mind and capability. And when it spoke, what it said seemed to bear this impression out. Before going on to what it actually said, it is worth recording at this point that Zaphod was the first living organic being to hear one of these creatures speak for something over ten billion years. If he had paid more attention to his ancient history 
lessons and less to his organic being, he might have been more impressed by this honour. 
The robot's voice was like its body, cold, sleek and lifeless. It had almost a cultured rasp to it. It sounded as ancient as it was. 
It said, "You do have a Kill-O-Zap blaster pistol in your hand." 
Zaphod didn't know what it meant for a moment, but then he glanced down at his own hand and was relieved to see that what he had found clipped to a wall bracket was indeed what he had thought it was. 
"Yeah," he said in a kind of relieved sneer, which is quite tricky, "well, I wouldn't want to overtax your imagination, robot." For a while nobody said anything, and Zaphod realized that the robots were obviously not here to make conversation, and that it was up to him. 
"I can't help noticing that you have parked your ship," he said with a nod of one of his heads in the appropriate direction, "through mine." 
There was no denying this. Without regard for any kind of proper dimensional behaviour they had simply materialized their ship precisely where they wanted it to be, which meant that it was simply locked through the Heart of Gold as if they were nothing more than two combs. 
Again, they made no response to this, and Zaphod wondered if the conversation would gather any momentum if he phrased his part of it in the form of questions. 
"... haven't you?" he added. 
"Yes," replied the robot." 
"Er, OK," said Zaphod. "So what are you cats doing here?" 
Silence. 
"Robots," said Zaphod, "what are you robots doing here?" 
"We have come," rasped the robot, "for the Gold of the Bail." 
Zaphod nodded. He waggled his gun to invite further elaboration. The robot seemed to understand this. 
"The Gold Bail is part of the Key we seek," continued the robot, "to release our Masters from Krikkit." 
Zaphod nodded again. He waggled his gun again. 
"The Key," continued the robot simply, "was disintegrated in time and space. The Golden Bail is embedded in the device which drives your ship. It will be reconstituted in the Key. Our Masters shall be released. The Universal Readjustment will continue." 
Zaphod nodded again. 
"What are you talking about?" he said. 
A slightly pained expression seemed to cross the robot's totally expressionless face. He seemed to be finding the conversation depressing. 
"Obliteration," it said. "We seek the Key," it repeated, "we already have the Wooden Pillar, the Steel Pillar and the Perspex Pillar. In a moment we will have the Gold Bail..." 
"No you won't." 
"We will," stated the robot. 
"No you won't. It makes my ship work." 
"In a moment," repeated the robot patiently, "we will have the Gold Bail..." 
"You will not," said Zaphod. 
"And then we must go," said the robot, in all seriousness, "to a party." 
"Oh," said Zaphod, startled. "Can I come?"â¨"No," said the robot. "We are going to shoot you." "Oh yeah?" said Zaphod, waggling his gun.â¨"Yes," said the robot, and they shot him. 
Zaphod was so surprised that they had to shoot him again before he fell down. 
Chapter 10 
"Shhh," said Slartibartfast. "Listen and watch." 
Night had now fallen on ancient Krikkit. The sky was dark and empty. The only light was coming from the nearby town, from which pleasant convivial sounds were drifting quietly on the breeze. They stood beneath a tree from which heady fragrances wafted around them. Arthur squatted and felt the Informational Illusion of the soil and the grass. He ran it through his fingers. The soil seemed heavy and rich, the grass strong. It was hard to avoid the impression that this was a thoroughly delightful place in all respects. 
The sky was, however, extremely blank and seemed to Arthur to cast a certain chill over the otherwise idyllic, if currently invisible, landscape. Still, he supposed, it's a question of what you're used to. 
He felt a tap on his shoulder and looked up. Slartibartfast was quietly directing his attention to something down the other side of the hill. He looked and could just see some faint lights dancing and waving, and moving slowly in their direction. 
As they came nearer, sounds became audible too, and soon the dim lights and noises resolved themselves into a small group of people who were walking home across the hill towards the town. 
They walked quite near the watchers beneath the tree, swinging lanterns which made soft and crazy lights dance among the trees and grass, chattering contentedly, and actually singing a song about how terribly nice everything was, how happy they were, how much they enjoyed working on the farm, and how pleasant it was to be going home to see their wives and children, with a lilting chorus to the effect that the flowers were smelling particularly nice at this time of year and that it was a pity the dog had died seeing as it liked them so much. Arthur could almost imagine Paul McCartney sitting with his feet up by the fire on evening, humming it to Linda and wondering what to buy with the proceeds, and thinking probably Essex. 
"The Masters of Krikkit," breathed Slartibartfast in sepulchral tones. 
Coming, as it did, so hard upon the heels of his own thoughts about Essex this remark caused Arthur a moment's confusion. Then the logic of the situation imposed itself on his scattered mind, and he discovered that he still didn't understand what the old man meant. 
"What?" he said. 
"The Masters of Krikkit," said Slartibartfast again, and if his breathing had been sepulchral before, this time he sounded like someone in Hades with bronchitis. 
Arthur peered at the group and tried to make sense of what little information he had at his disposal at this point. 
The people in the group were clearly alien, if only because they seemed a little tall, thin, angular and almost as pale as to be white, but otherwise they appeared remarkably pleasant; a little whimsical perhaps, one wouldn't necessarily want to spend a long coach journey with them, but the point was that if they deviated in any way from being good straightforward people it was in being perhaps too nice rather than not nice enough. So why all this rasping lungwork from Slartibartfast which would seem more appropriate to a radio commercial for one of those nasty films about chainsaw operators taking their work home with them? 
Then, this Krikkit angle was a tough one, too. He hadn't quite fathomed the connection between what he knew as cricket, and what... 
Slartibartfast interrupted his train of thought at this point as if sensing what was going through his mind. 
"The game you know as cricket," he said, and his voice still seemed to be wandering lost in subterranean passages, "is just one of those curious freaks of racial memory which can keep images alive in the mind aeons after their true significance has been lost in the mists of time. Of all the races on the Galaxy, only the English could possibly revive the memory of the most horrific wars ever to sunder the Universe and transform it into what I'm afraid is generally regarded as an incomprehensibly dull and pointless game. 
"Rather fond of it myself," he added, "but in most people's eyes you have been inadvertently guilty of the most grotesque bad taste. Particularly the bit about the little red ball hitting the wicket, that's very nasty." 
"Um," said Arthur with a reflective frown to indicate that his cognitive synapses were coping with this as best as they could, "um." 
"And these," said Slartibartfast, slipping back into crypt guttural and indicating the group of Krikkit men who had now walked past them, "are the ones who started it all, and it will start tonight. Come, we will follow, and see why." 
They slipped out from underneath the tree, and followed the cheery party along the dark hill path. Their natural instinct was to tread quietly and stealthily in pursuit of their quarry, though, as they were simply walking through a recorded Informational Illusion, they could as easily have been wearing euphoniums and woad for all the notice their quarry would have taken of them. 
Arthur noticed that a couple of members of the party were now singing a different song. It came lilting back to them through the soft night air, and was a sweet romantic ballad which would have netted McCartney Kent and Essex and enabled him to put in a fair offer for Hampshire. 
"You must surely know," said Slartibartfast to Ford, "what it is that is about to happen?" 
"Me?" said Ford. "No." 
"Did you not learn Ancient Galactic History when you were a child?" 
"I was in the cybercubicle behind Zaphod," said Ford, "it was very distracting. Which isn't to say that I didn't learn some pretty stunning things." 
At this point Arthur noticed a curious feature to the song that the party were singing. The middle eight bridge, which would have had McCartney firmly consolidated in Winchester and gazing intently over the Test Valley to the rich pickings of the New Forest beyond, had some curious lyrics. The songwriter was referring to meeting with a girl not "under the moon" or "beneath the stars" but "above the grass", which struck Arthur a little prosaic. Then he looked up again at the bewildering black sky, and had the distinct feeling that there was an important point here, if only he could grasp what it was. It gave him a feeling of being alone in the Universe, and he said so. 
"No," said Slartibartfast, with a slight quickening of his step, "the people of Krikkit have never thought to themselves 'We are alone in 
the Universe.' They are surrounded by a huge Dust Cloud, you see, their single sun with its single world, and they are right out on the utmost eastern edge of the Galaxy. Because of the Dust Cloud there has never been anything to see in the sky. At night it is totally blank, During the day there is the sun, but you can't look directly at that so they don't. They are hardly aware of the sky. It's as if they had a blind spot which extended 180 degrees from horizon to horizon. 
"You see, the reason why they have never thought 'We are alone in the Universe' is that until tonight they don't know about the Universe. Until tonight." 
He moved on, leaving the words ringing in the air behind him. 
"Imagine," he said, "never even thinking 'We are alone' simply because it has never occurred to you to think that there's any other way to be." 
He moved on again. 
"I'm afraid this is going to be a little unnerving," he added. 
As he spoke, they became aware of a very thin roaring scream high up in the sightless sky above them. They glanced upwards in alarm, but for a moment or two could see nothing. 
Then Arthur noticed that the people in the party in front of them had heard the noise, but that none of them seemed to know what to do with it. They were glancing around themselves in consternation, left, right, forwards, backwards, even at the ground. It never occurred to them to look upwards. 
The profoundness of the shock and horror they emanated a few moments later when the burning wreckage of a spaceship came hurtling and screaming out of the sky and crashed about half a mile from where they were standing was something that you had to be there to experience. 
Some speak of the Heart of Gold in hushed tones, some of the Starship Bistromath. 
Many speak of the legendary and gigantic Starship Titanic, a majestic and luxurious cruise-liner launched from the great shipbuilding asteroid complexes of Artifactovol some hundreds of years ago now, and with good reason. 
It was sensationally beautiful, staggeringly huge, and more pleasantly equipped than any ship in what now remains of history (see note below on the Campaign for Real Time) but it had the misfortune to be built in the very earliest days of Improbability Physics, long before this difficult and cussed branch of knowledge was fully, or at all, understood. 
The designers and engineers decided, in their innocence, to build a prototype Improbability Field into it, which was meant, supposedly, to ensure that it was Infinitely Improbable that anything would ever go wrong with any part of the ship. 
They did not realize that because of the quasi-reciprocal and circular nature of all Improbability calculations, anything that was Infinitely Improbable was actually very likely to happen almost immediately. 
The Starship Titanic was a monstrously pretty sight as it lay beached like a silver Arcturan Megavoidwhale amongst the laser-lit tracery of its construction gantries, a brilliant cloud of pins and needles of light against the deep interstellar blackness; but when launched, it did not even manage to complete its very first radio message an SOS before undergoing a sudden and gratuitous total existence failure. 
However, the same event which saw the disastrous failure of one science in its infancy also witnessed the apotheosis of another. It was conclusively proven that more people watched the tri-d coverage of the launch than actually existed at the time, and this has now been recognized as the greatest achievement ever in the science of audience research. 
Another spectacular media event of that time was the supernova which the star Ysllodins underwent a few hours later. Ysllodins is the star around which most of the Galaxy's major insurance underwriters live, or rather lived. 
But whilst these spaceships, and other great ones which come to mind, such as the Galactic Fleet Battleships the GSS Daring, the GSS Audacy and the GSS Suicidal Insanity are all spoken of with awe, pride, enthusiasm, affection, admiration, regret, jealousy, resentment, in fact most of the better known emotions, the one which regularly commands the most actual astonishment was Krikkit One, the first 
spaceship ever built by the people of Krikkit. This is not because it was a wonderful ship. It wasn't. 
It was a crazy piece of near junk. It looked as if it had been knocked up in somebody's backyard, and this was in fact precisely where it had been knocked up. The astonishing thing about the ship was not that it was one well (it wasn't) but that it was done at all. The period of time which had elapsed between the moment that the people of Krikkit had discovered that there was such a thing as space and the launching of their first spaceship was almost exactly a year. 
Ford Prefect was extremely grateful, as he strapped himself in, that this was just another Informational Illusion, and that he was therefore completely safe. In real life it wasn't a ship he would have set foot in for all the rice wine in China. "Extremely rickety" was one phrase which sprang to mind, and "Please may I get out?" was another. 
"This is going to fly?" said Arthur, giving gaunt looks, at the lashed- together pipework and wiring which festooned the cramped interior of the ship. 
Slartibartfast assured him that it would, that they were perfectly safe and that it was all going to be extremely instructive and not a little harrowing. 
Ford and Arthur decided just to relax and be harrowed. 
"Why not," said Ford, "go mad?" 
In front of them and, of course, totally unaware of their presence for the very good reason that they weren't actually there, were the three pilots. They had also constructed the ship. They had been on the hill path that night singing wholesome heartwarming songs. Their brains had been very slightly turned by the nearby crash of the alien spaceship. They had spent weeks stripping every tiniest last secret out of the wreckage of that burnt-up spaceship, all the while singing lilting spaceship-stripping ditties. They had then built their own ship and this was it. This was their ship, and they were currently singing a little song about that too, expressing the twin joys of achievement and ownership. The chorus was a little poignant, and told of their sorrow that their work had kept them such long hours in the garage, away from the company of their wives and children, who had missed them terribly but had kept them cheerful by bringing them continual stories of how nicely the puppy was growing up. 
Pow, they took off. 
They roared into the sky like a ship that knew precisely what it was doing. 
"No way," said Ford a while later after they had recovered from the shock of acceleration, and were climbing up out of the planet's atmosphere, "no way," he repeated, "does anyone design and build a ship like this in a year, no matter how motivated. I don't believe it. Prove it to me and I still won't believe it." He shook his head thoughtfully and gazed out of a tiny port at the nothingness outside it. 
The trip passed uneventfully for a while, and Slartibartfast fastwound them through it. 
Very quickly, therefore, they arrived at the inner perimeter of the hollow, spherical Dust Cloud which surrounded their sun and home planet, occupying, as it were, the next orbit out. 
It was more as if there was a gradual change in the texture and consistency of space. The darkness seemed now to thrum and ripple past them. It was a very cold darkness, a very blank and heavy darkness, it was the darkness of the night sky of Krikkit. 
The coldness and heaviness and blankness of it took a slow grip on Arthur's heart, and he felt acutely aware of the feelings of the Krikkit pilots which hung in the air like a thick static charge. They were now on the very boundary of the historical knowledge of their race. This was the very limit beyond which none of them had ever speculated, or even known that there was any speculation to be done. 
The darkness of the cloud buffeted at the ship. Inside was the silence of history. Their historic mission was to find out if there was anything or anywhere on the other side of the sky, from which the wrecked spaceship could have come, another world maybe, strange and incomprehensible though this thought was to the enclosed minds of those who had lived beneath the sky of Krikkit. 
History was gathering itself to deliver another blow. 
Still the darkness thrummed at them, the blank enclosing darkness. It seemed closer and closer, thicker and thicker, heavier and heavier. And suddenly it was gone. 
They flew out of the cloud. 
They saw the staggering jewels of the night in their infinite dust and their minds sang with fear. 
For a while they flew on, motionless against the starry sweep of the Galaxy, itself motionless against the infinite sweep of the Universe. And then they turned round. 
"It'll have to go," the men of Krikkit said as they headed back for home. 
On the way back they sang a number of tuneful and reflective songs on the subjects of peace, justice, morality, culture, sport, family life and the obliteration of all other life forms. 
Chapter 11 
"So you see," said Slartibartfast, slowly stirring his artificially constructed coffee, and thereby also stirring the whirlpool interfaces between real and unreal numbers, between the interactive perceptions of mind and Universe, and thus generating the restructured matrices of implicitly enfolded subjectivity which allowed his ship to reshape the very concept of time and space, "how it is." 
"Yes," said Arthur.â¨"Yes," said Ford.â¨"What do I do," said Arthur, "with this piece of chicken?" Slartibartfast glanced at him gravely.â¨"Toy with it," he said, "toy with it."â¨He demonstrated with his own piece. 
Arthur did so, and felt the slight tingle of a mathematical function thrilling through the chicken leg as it moved four-dimensionally through what Slartibartfast had assured him was five-dimensional space. 
"Overnight," said Slartibartfast, "the whole population of Krikkit was transformed from being charming, delightful, intelligent..." 
"... if whimsical..." interpolated Arthur. 
"... ordinary people," said Slartibartfast, "into charming, delightful, intelligent..." 
"... whimsical..." 
"... manic xenophobes. The idea of a Universe didn't fit into their world picture, so to speak. They simply couldn't cope with it. And so, charmingly, delightfully, intelligently, whimsically if you like, they decided to destroy it. What's the matter now?" 
"I don't like the wine very much," said Arthur sniffing it. "Well, send it back. It's all part of the mathematics of it." 
Arthur did so. He didn't like the topography of the waiter's smile, but he'd never liked graphs anyway. 
"Where are we going?" said Ford. 
"Back to the Room of Informational Illusions," said Slartibartfast, rising and patting his mouth with the mathematical representation of a paper napkin, "for the second half." 
Chapter 12 
"The people of Krikkit," said His High Judgmental Supremacy, Judiciary Pag, LIVR (the Learned, Impartial and Very Relaxed) Chairman of the Board of Judges at the Krikkit War Crimes Trial, "are, well, you know, they're just a bunch of real sweet guys, you know, who just happen to want to kill everybody. Hell, I feel the same way some mornings. Shit. 
"OK," he continued, swinging his feet up on to the bench in front of him and pausing a moment to pick a thread off his Ceremonial Beach Loafers, "so you wouldn't necessarily want to share a Galaxy with these guys." 
This was true. 
The Krikkit attack on the Galaxy had been stunning. Thousands and thousands of huge Krikkit warships had leapt suddenly out of hyperspace and simultaneously attacked thousands and thousands of major worlds, first seizing vital material supplies for building the next wave, and then calmly zapping those worlds out of existence. 
The Galaxy, which had been enjoying a period of unusual peace and prosperity at the time, reeled like a man getting mugged in a meadow. 
"I mean," continued Judiciary Pag, gazing round the ultra-modern (this was ten billion years ago, when "ultra-modern" meant lots of stainless steel and brushed concrete) and huge courtroom, "these guys are just obsessed." 
This too was true, and is the only explanation anyone has yet managed to come up with for the unimaginable speed with which the people of Krikkit had pursued their new and absolute purpose the destruction of everything that wasn't Krikkit. 
It is also the only explanation for their bewildering sudden grasp of all the hypertechnology involved in building their thousands of spaceships, and their millions of lethal white robots. 
These had really struck terror into the hearts of everyone who had encountered them in most cases, however, the terror was extremely short-lived, as was the person experiencing the terror. They were savage, single-minded flying battle machines. They wielded formidable multifunctional battleclubs which, brandished one way, would knock down buildings and, brandished another way, fired blistering Omni-Destructo Zap Rays and, brandished a third way, launched a hideous arsenal of grenades, ranging from minor incendiary devices to Maxi-Slorta Hypernuclear Devices which could take out a major sun. Simply striking the grenades with the battleclubs simultaneously primed them, and launched them with phenomenal accuracy over distances ranging from mere yards to hundreds of thousands of miles. 
"OK," said Judiciary Pag again, "so we won." He paused and chewed a little gum. "We won," he repeated, "but that's no big deal. I mean a medium-sized galaxy against one little world, and how long did it take us? Clerk of the Court?" 
"M'lud?" said the severe little man in black, rising. 
"How long, kiddo?" 
"It is a trifle difficult, m'lud, to be precise in this matter. Time and distance..." 
"Relax, guy, be vague."â¨"I hardly like to be vague, m'lud, over such a..." "Bite the bullet and be it." 
The Clerk of the Court blinked at him. It was clear that like most of the Galactic legal profession he found Judiciary Pag (or Zipo Bibrok 5x108, as his private name was known, inexplicably, to be) a rather distressing figure. He was clearly a bounder and a cad. He seemed to think that the fact that he was the possessor of the finest legal mind ever discovered gave him the right to behave exactly as he liked, and unfortunately he appeared to be right. 
"Er, well, m'lud, very approximately, two thousand years," the Clerk murmured unhappily. 
"And how many guys zilched out?" 
"Two grillion, m'lud." The Clerk sat down. A hydrospectic photo of him at this point would have revealed that he was steaming slightly. 
Judiciary Pag gazed once more around the courtroom, wherein were assembled hundreds of the very highest officials of the entire Galactic administration, all in their ceremonial uniforms or bodies, depending on metabolism and custom. Behind a wall of Zap-Proof Crystal stood a representative group of the people of Krikkit, looking with calm, polite loathing at all the aliens gathered to pass judgment on them. This was the most momentous occasion in legal history, and Judiciary Pag knew it. 
He took out his chewing gum and stuck it under his chair.â¨"That's a whole lotta stiffs," he said quietly.â¨The grim silence in the courtroom seemed in accord with this view. 
"So, like I said, these are a bunch of really sweet guys, but you wouldn't want to share a Galaxy with them, not if they're just gonna keep at it, not if they're not gonna learn to relax a little. I mean it's just gonna be continual nervous time, isn't it, right? Pow, pow, pow, when are they next coming at us? Peaceful coexistence is just right out, right? Get me some water somebody, thank you." 
He sat back and sipped reflectively. 
"OK," he said, "hear me, hear me. It's, like, these guys, you know, are entitled to their own view of the Universe. And according to their view, which the Universe forced on them, right, they did right. Sounds crazy, but I think you'll agree. They believe in..." 
He consulted a piece of paper which he found in the back pocket of his Judicial jeans. 
"They believe in 'peace, justice, morality, culture, sport, family life, and the obliteration of all other life forms'." 
He shrugged. 
"I've heard a lot worse," he said. 
He scratched his crotch reflectively. 
"Freeeow," he said. He took another sip of water, then held it up to the light and frowned at it. He twisted it round. 
"Hey, is there something in this water?" he said. 
"Er, no, m'lud," said the Court Usher who had brought it to him, rather nervously. 
"Then take it away," snapped Judiciary Pag, "and put something in it. I got an idea." 
He pushed away the glass and leaned forward. "Hear me, hear me," he said.â¨The solution was brilliant, and went like this: 
The planet of Krikkit was to be enclosed for perpetuity in an envelope of Slo-Time, inside which life would continue almost infinitely slowly. All light would be deflected round the envelope so that it would remain invisible and impenetrable. Escape from the envelope would be utterly impossible unless it were locked from the outside. 
When the rest of the Universe came to its final end, when the whole of creation reached its dying fall (this was all, of course, in the days before it was known that the end of the Universe would be a spectacular catering venture) and life and matter ceased to exist, then the planet of Krikkit and its sun would emerge from its Slo-Time envelope and continue a solitary existence, such as it craved, in the twilight of the Universal void. 
The Lock would be on an asteroid which would slowly orbit the envelope. 
The key would be the symbol of the Galaxy the Wikkit Gate. 
By the time the applause in the court had died down, Judiciary Pag was already in the Sens-O-Shower with a rather nice member of the jury that he'd slipped a note to half an hour earlier. 
Chapter 13 
Two months later, Zipo Bibrok 5x108 had cut the bottoms off his Galactic State jeans, and was spending part of the enormous fee his judgments commanded lying on a jewelled beach having Essence of Qualactin rubbed into his back by the same rather nice member of the jury. She was a Soolfinian girl from beyond the Cloudworlds of Yaga. She had skin like lemon silk and was very interested in legal bodies. 
"Did you hear the news?" she said. 
"Weeeeelaaaaah!" said Zipo Bibrok 5x108, and you would have had to have been there to know exactly why he said this. None of this was on the tape of Informational Illusions, and is all based on hearsay. 
"No," he added, when the thing that had made him say "Weeeeelaaaaah" had stopped happening. He moved his body round slightly to catch the first rays of the third and greatest of primeval Vod's three suns which was now creeping over the ludicrously beautiful horizon, and the sky now glittered with some of the greatest tanning power ever known. 
A fragrant breeze wandered up from the quiet sea, trailed alongâ¨the beach, and drifted back to sea again, wondering where to go next. On a mad impulse it went up to the beach again. It drifted back to sea. 
"I hope it isn't good news," muttered Zipo Bibrok 5x108, "'cos I don't think I could bear it." 
"Your Krikkit judgment was carried out today," said the girl sumptuously. There was no need to say such a straightforward thing sumptuously, but she went ahead and did it anyway because it was that sort of day. "I heard it on the radio," she said, "when I went back to the ship for the oil." 
"Uhuh," muttered Zipo and rested his head back on the jewelled sand. 
"Something happened," she said. "Mmmm?" 
"Just after the Slo-Time envelope was locked," she said, and paused a moment from rubbing in the Essence of Qualactin, "a Krikkit warship which had been missing presumed destroyed turned out to be just missing after all. It appeared and tried to seize the Key." 
Zipo sat up sharply. 
"Hey, what?" he said. 
"It's all right," she said in a voice which would have calmed the Big Bang down. "Apparently there was a short battle. The Key and the warship were disintegrated and blasted into the space-time continuum. Apparently they are lost for ever." 
She smiled, and ran a little more Essence of Qualactin on to her fingertips. He relaxed and lay back down. 
"Do what you did a moment or two ago," he murmured. "That?" she said.â¨"No, no," he said, "that."â¨She tried again. 
"That?" she asked.â¨"Weeeeelaaaaah!"â¨Again, you had to be there.â¨The fragrant breeze drifted up from the sea again.â¨A magician wandered along the beach, but no one needed him. 
Chapter 14 
"Nothing is lost for ever," said Slartibartfast, his face flickering redly in the light of the candle which the robot waiter was trying to take away, "except for the Cathedral of Chalesm." 
"The what?" said Arthur with a start. 
"The Cathedral of Chalesm," repeated Slartibartfast. "It was during the course of my researches at the Campaign for Real Time that I..." 
"The what?" said Arthur again. 
The old man paused and gathered his thoughts, for what he hoped would be one last onslaught on his story. The robot waiter moved through the space-time matrices in a way which spectacularly combined the surly with the obsequious, made a snatch for the candle and got it. They had had the bill, had argued convincingly about who had had the cannelloni and how many bottles of wine they had had, and, as Arthur had been dimly aware, had thereby successfully manoeuvred the ship out of subjective space and into a parking orbit round a strange planet. The waiter was now anxious to complete his part of the charade and clear the bistro. 
"All will become clear," said Slartibartfast. 
"When?" 
"In a minute. Listen. The time streams are now very polluted. There's a lot of muck floating about in them, flotsam and jetsam, and more and more of it is now being regurgitated into the physical world. Eddies in the space-time continuum, you see." 
"So I hear," said Arthur. 
"Look, where are we going?" said Ford, pushing his chair back from the table with impatience. "Because I'm eager to get there." 
"We are going," said Slartibartfast in a slow, measured voice, "to try to prevent the war robots of Krikkit from regaining the whole of the Key they need to unlock the planet of Krikkit from the Slo-Time envelope and release the rest of their army and their mad Masters." 
"It's just," said Ford, "that you mentioned a party." 
"I did," said Slartibartfast, and hung his head. 
He realized that it had been a mistake, because the idea seemed to exercise a strange and unhealthy fascination on the mind of Ford Prefect. The more that Slartibartfast unravelled the dark and tragic story of Krikkit and its people, the more Ford Prefect wanted to drink a lot and dance with girls. 
The old man felt that he should not have mentioned the party until he absolutely had to. But there it was, the fact was out, and Ford Prefect had attached himself to it the way an Arcturan Megaleach attaches itself to its victim before biting his head off and making off with his spaceship. 
"When," said Ford eagerly, "do we get there?" 
"When I've finished telling you why we have to go there." 
"I know why I'm going," said Ford, and leaned back, sticking his hands behind his head. He gave one of his smiles which made people twitch. 
Slartibartfast had hoped for an easy retirement. 
He had been planning to learn to play the octraventral heebiephone a pleasantly futile task, he knew, because he had the wrong number of mouths. 
He had also been planning to write an eccentric and relentlessly inaccurate monograph on the subject of equatorial fjords in order to set the record wrong about one or two matters he saw as important. 
Instead, he had somehow got talked into doing some part-time work for the Campaign for Real Time and had started to take it all seriously for the first time in his life. As a result he now found himself spending his fast-declining years combating evil and trying to save the Galaxy. 
He found it exhausting work and sighed heavily. "Listen," he said, "at Camtim..."â¨"What?" said Arthur. 
"The Campaign for Real Time, which I will tell you about later. I noticed that five pieces of jetsam which had in relatively recent times plopped back into existence seemed to correspond to the five pieces of the missing Key. Only two I could trace exactly the Wooden Pillar, which appeared on your planet, and the Silver Bail. It seems to be at 
some sort of party. We must go there to retrieve it before the Krikkit robots find it, or who knows what may hap?" 
"No," said Ford firmly. "We must go to the party in order to drink a lot and dance with girls." 
"But haven't you understood everything I...?" 
"Yes," said Ford, with a sudden and unexpected fierceness, "I've understood it all perfectly well. That's why I want to have as many drinks and dance with as many girls as possible while there are still any left. If everything you've shown us is true..." 
"True? Of course it's true." 
"... then we don't stand a whelk's chance in a supernova." 
"A what?" said Arthur sharply again. He had been following the conversation doggedly up to this point, and was keen not to lose the thread now. 
"A whelk's chance in a supernova," repeated Ford without losing momentum. "The..." 
"What's a whelk got to do with a supernova?" said Arthur. 
"It doesn't," said Ford levelly, "stand a chance in one." 
He paused to see if the matter was now cleared up. The freshly puzzled looks clambering across Arthur's face told him that it wasn't. 
"A supernova," said Ford as quickly and as clearly as he could, "is a star which explodes at almost half the speed of light and burns with the brightness of a billion suns and then collapses as a super-heavy neutron star. It's a star which burns up other stars, got it? Nothing stands a chance in a supernova." 
"I see," said Arthur. 
"The..." 
"So why a whelk particularly?" 
"Why not a whelk? Doesn't matter." 
Arthur accepted this, and Ford continued, picking up his early fierce momentum as best he could. 
"The point is," he said, "that people like you and me, Slartibartfast, and Arthur particularly and especially Arthur are just dilletantes, eccentrics, layabouts, fartarounds if you like." 
Slartibartfast frowned, partly in puzzlement and partly in umbrage. He started to speak. 
" ..." is as far as he got. 
"We're not obsessed by anything, you see," insisted Ford. 
"..." 
"And that's the deciding factor. We can't win against obsession. They care, we don't. They win." 
"I care about lots of things," said Slartibartfast, his voice trembling partly with annoyance, but partly also with uncertainty. 
"Such as?" 
"Well," said the old man, "life, the Universe. Everything, really. Fjords." 
"Would you die for them?" 
"Fjords?" blinked Slartibartfast in surprise. "No." 
"Well then." 
"Wouldn't see the point, to be honest." 
"And I still can't see the connection," said Arthur, "with whelks." 
Ford could feel the conversation slipping out of his control, and refused to be sidetracked by anything at this point. 
"The point is," he hissed, "that we are not obsessive people, and we don't stand a chance against..." 
"Except for your sudden obsession with whelks," pursued Arthur, "which I still haven't understood." 
"Will you please leave whelks out of it?" 
"I will if you will," said Arthur. "You brought the subject up." 
"It was an error," said Ford, "forget them. The point is this." 
He leant forward and rested his forehead on the tips of his fingers. 
"What was I talking about?" he said wearily. 
"Let's just go down to the party," said Slartibartfast, "for whatever reason." He stood up, shaking his head. 
"I think that's what I was trying to say," said Ford. 
For some unexplained reason, the teleport cubicles were in the bathroom. 
Chapter 15 
Time travel is increasingly regarded as a menace. History is being polluted. 
The Encyclopedia Galactica has much to say on the theory and practice of time travel, most of which is incomprehensible to anyone who hasn't spent at least four lifetimes studying advanced hypermathematics, and since it was impossible to do this before time travel was invented, there is a certain amount of confusion as to how the idea was arrived at in the first place. One rationalization of this problem states that time travel was, by its very nature, discovered simultaneously at all periods of history, but this is clearly bunk. 
The trouble is that a lot of history is now quite clearly bunk as well. 
Here is an example. It may not seem to be an important one to some people, but to others it is crucial. It is certainly significant in that it was the single event which caused the Campaign for Real Time to be set up in the first place (or is it last? It depends which way round you see history as happening, and this too is now an increasingly vexed question). 
There is, or was, a poet. His name was Lallafa, and he wrote what are widely regarded throughout the Galaxy as being the finest poems in existence, the Songs of the Long Land. 
They are/were unspeakably wonderful. That is to say, you couldn't speak very much of them at once without being so overcome with emotion, truth and a sense of wholeness and oneness of things that you wouldn't pretty soon need a brisk walk round the block, possibly pausing at a bar on the way back for a quick glass of perspective and soda. They were that good. 
Lallafa had lived in the forests of the Long Lands of Effa. He lived there, and he wrote his poems there. He wrote them on pages made of dried habra leaves, without the benefit of education or correcting fluid. He wrote about the light in the forest and what he thought about that. He wrote about the darkness in the forest, and what he 
thought about that. He wrote about the girl who had left him and precisely what he thought about that. 
Long after his death his poems were found and wondered over. News of them spread like morning sunlight. For centuries they illuminated and watered the lives of many people whose lives might otherwise have been darker and drier. 
Then, shortly after the invention of time travel, some major correcting fluid manufacturers wondered whether his poems might have been better still if he had had access to some high-quality correcting fluid, and whether he might be persuaded to say a few words on that effect. 
They travelled the time waves, they found him, they explained the situation with some difficulty to him, and did indeed persuade him. In fact they persuaded him to such an effect that he becameâ¨extremely rich at their hands, and the girl about whom he was otherwise destined to write which such precision never got around to leaving him, and in fact they moved out of the forest to a rather nice pad in town and he frequently commuted to the future to do chat shows, on which he sparkled wittily. 
He never got around to writing the poems, of course, which was a problem, but an easily solved one. The manufacturers of correcting fluid simply packed him off for a week somewhere with a copy of a later edition of his book and a stack of dried habra leaves to copy them out on to, making the odd deliberate mistake and correction on the way. 
Many people now say that the poems are suddenly worthless. Others argue that they are exactly the same as they always were, so what's changed? The first people say that that isn't the point. They aren't quite sure what the point is, but they are quite sure that that isn't it. They set up the Campaign for Real Time to try to stop this sort of thing going on. Their case was considerably strengthened by the fact that a week after they had set themselves up, news broke that not only had the great Cathedral of Chalesm been pulled down in order to build a new ion refinery, but that the construction of the refinery had taken so long, and had had to extend so far back into the past in order to allow ion production to start on time, that the Cathedral of Chalesm had now never been built in the first place. 
Picture postcards of the cathedral suddenly became immensely valuable. 
So a lot of history is now gone for ever. The Campaign for Real Timers claim that just as easy travel eroded the differences between one country and another, and between one world and another, so time travel is now eroding the differences between one age and another. "The past," they say, "is now truly like a foreign country. They do things exactly the same there." 
Chapter 16 
Arthur materialized, and did so with all the customary staggering about and clasping at his throat, heart and various limbs which he still indulged himself in whenever he made any of these hateful and painful materializations that he was determined not to let himself get used to. 
He looked around for the others.â¨They weren't there.â¨He looked around for the others again. They still weren't there.â¨He closed his eyes.â¨He opened themâ¨He looked around for the others.â¨They obstinately persisted in their absence. 
He closed his eyes again, preparatory to making this completely futile exercise once more, and because it was only then, whilst his eyes were closed, that his brain began to register what his eyes had been looking at whilst they were open, a puzzled frown crept across his face. 
So he opened his eyes again to check his facts and the frown stayed put. 
If anything, it intensified, and got a good firm grip. If this was a party it was a very bad one, so bad, in fact, that everybody else had left. He abandoned this line of thought as futile. Obviously this wasn't a party. It was a cave, or a labyrinth, or a tunnel of something there was insufficient light to tell. All was darkness, a damp shiny darkness. The only sounds were the echoes of his own breathing, which sounded worried. He coughed very slightly, and then had to listen to the thin ghostly echo of his cough trailing away amongst winding corridors and sightless chambers, as of some great labyrinth, and 
eventually returning to him via the same unseen corridors, as if to say... "Yes?" 
This happened to every slightest noise he made, and it unnerved him. He tried to hum a cheery tune, but by the time it returned to him it was a hollow dirge and he stopped. 
His mind was suddenly full of images from the story that Slartibartfast had been telling him. He half-expected suddenly to see lethal white robots step silently from the shadows and kill him. He caught his breath. They didn't. He let it go again. He didn't know what he did expect. 
Someone or something, however, seemed to be expecting him, for at that moment there lit up suddenly in the dark distance an eerie green neon sign. 
It said, silently: 
YOU HAVE BEEN DIVERTED 
The sign flicked off again, in a way which Arthur was not at all certain he liked. It flicked off with a sort of contemptuous flourish. Arthur then tried to assure himself that this was just a ridiculous trick of his imagination. A neon sign is either on or off, depending on whether it has electricity running through it or not. There was no way, he told himself, that it could possibly effect the transition from one state to the other with a contemptuous flourish. He hugged himself tightly in his dressing gown and shivered, nevertheless. 
The neon sign in the depths now suddenly lit up, bafflingly, with just three dots and a comma. Like this: 
..., 
Only in green neon. 
It was trying, Arthur realized after staring at this perplexedly for a second or two, to indicate that there was more to come, that the sentence was not complete. Trying with almost superhuman pedantry, he reflected. Or at least, inhuman pedantry. 
The sentence then completed itself with these two words: 
ARTHUR DENT. 
He reeled. He steadied himself to have another clear look at it. It still said ARTHUR DENT, so he reeled again. 
Once again, the sign flicked off, and left him blinking in the darkness with just the dim red image of his name jumping on his retina. 
WELCOME, the sign now suddenly said. After a moment, it added:â¨I DON'T THINK. 
The stone-cold fear which had been hovering about Arthur all this time, waiting for its moment, recognized that its moment had now come and pounced on him. He tried to fight it off. He dropped into a kind of alert crouch that he had once seen somebody do on television, but it must have been someone with stronger knees. He peered huntedly into the darkness. 
"Er, hello?" he said. 
He cleared his throat and said it again, more loudly and without the "er". At some distance down the corridor it seemed suddenly as if somebody started to beat on a bass drum. 
He listened to it for a few seconds and realized that it was just his heart beating. 
He listened for a few seconds more and realized that it wasn't his heart beating, it was somebody down the corridor beating on a bass drum. 
Beads of sweat formed on his brow, tensed themselves, and leapt off. He put a hand out on the floor to steady his alert crouch, which wasn't holding up very well. The sign changed itself again. It said: 
DO NOT BE ALARMED.â¨After a pause, it added:â¨BE VERY VERY FRIGHTENED, ARTHUR DENT. 
Once again it flicked off. Once again it left him in darkness. His eyes seemed to be popping out of his head. He wasn't certain if this was because they were trying to see more clearly, or if they simply wanted to leave at this point. 
"Hello?" he said again, this time trying to put a note of rugged and aggressive self-assertion into it. "Is anyone there?" 
There was no reply, nothing. 
This unnerved Arthur Dent even more than a reply would have done, and he began to back away from the scary nothingness. And 
the more he backed away, the more scared he became. After a while he realized that the reason for this was because of all the films he had seen in which the hero backs further and further away from some imagined terror in front of him, only to bump into it coming up from behind. 
Just then it suddenly occurred to him to turn round rather quickly. 
There was nothing there. 
Just blackness. 
This really unnerved him, and he started to back away from that, back the way he had come. 
After doing this for a short while it suddenly occurred to him that he was now backing towards whatever it was he had been backing away from in the first place. 
This, he couldn't help thinking, must be a foolish thing to do. He decided he would be better off backing the way he had first been backing, and turned around again. 
It turned out at this point that his second impulse had been the correct one, because there was an indescribably hideous monster standing quietly behind him. Arthur yawed wildly as his skin tried to jump one way and his skeleton the other, whilst his brain tried to work out which of his ears it most wanted to crawl out of. 
"Bet you weren't expecting to see me again," said the monster, which Arthur couldn't help thinking was a strange remark for it to make, seeing as he had never met the creature before. He could tell that he hadn't met the creature before from the simple fact that he was able to sleep at nights. It was... it was... it was... 
Arthur blinked at it. It stood very still. It did look a little familiar. 
A terrible cold calm came over him as he realized that what he was looking at was a six-foot-high hologram of a housefly. 
He wondered why anybody would be showing him a six-foot-high hologram of a housefly at this time. He wondered whose voice he had heard. 
It was a terribly realistic hologram. 
It vanished. 
"Or perhaps you remember me better," said the voice suddenly, and it was a deep, hollow malevolent voice which sounded like 
molten tar glurping out of a drum with evil on its mind, "as the rabbit." 
With a sudden ping, there was a rabbit there in the black labyrinth with him, a huge, monstrously, hideously soft and lovable rabbit an image again, but one on which every single soft and lovable hair seemed like a real and single thing growing in its soft and lovable coat. Arthur was startled to see his own reflection in its soft and lovable unblinking and extremely huge brown eyes. 
"Born in darkness," rumbled the voice, "raised in darkness. One morning I poked my head for the first time into the bright new world and got it split open by what felt suspiciously like some primitive instrument made of flint. 
"Made by you, Arthur Dent, and wielded by you. Rather hard as I recall. 
"You turned my skin into a bag for keeping interesting stones in. I happen to know that because in my next life I came back as a fly again and you swatted me. Again. Only this time you swatted me with the bag you'd made of my previous skin. 
"Arthur Dent, you are not merely a cruel and heartless man, you are also staggeringly tactless." 
The voice paused whilst Arthur gawped. 
"I see you have lost the bag," said the voice. "Probably got bored with it, did you?" 
Arthur shook his head helplessly. He wanted to explain that he had been in fact very fond of the bag and had looked after it very well and had taken it with him wherever he went, but that somehow every time he travelled anywhere he seemed inexplicably to end up with the wrong bag and that, curiously enough, even as they stood there he was just noticing for the first time that the bag he had with him at the moment appeared to be made out of rather nasty fake leopard skin, and wasn't the one he'd had a few moments ago before he arrived in this whatever place it was, and wasn't one he would have chosen himself and heaven knew what would be in it as it wasn't his, and he would much rather have his original bag back, except that he was of course terribly sorry for having so peremptorily removed it, or rather its component parts, i.e. the rabbit skin, from its previous owner, viz. the rabbit whom he currently had the honour of attempting vainly to address. 
All he actually managed to say was "Erp". 
"Meet the newt you trod on," said the voice. 
And there was, standing in the corridor with Arthur, a giant green scaly newt. Arthur turned, yelped, leapt backwards, and found himself standing in the middle of the rabbit. He yelped again, but could find nowhere to leap to. 
"That was me, too," continued the voice in a low menacing rumble, "as if you didn't know..." 
"Know?" said Arthur with a start. "Know?" 
"The interesting thing about reincarnation," rasped the voice, "is that most people, most spirits, are not aware that it is happening to them." 
He paused for effect. As far as Arthur was concerned there was already quite enough effect going on. 
"I was aware," hissed the voice, "that is, I became aware. Slowly. Gradually." 
He, whoever he was, paused again and gathered breath. 
"I could hardly help it, could I?" he bellowed, "when the same thing kept happening, over and over and over again! Every life I ever lived, I got killed by Arthur Dent. Any world, any body, any time, I'm just getting settled down, along comes Arthur Dent pow, he kills me. 
"Hard not to notice. Bit of a memory jogger. Bit of a pointer. Bit of a bloody giveaway! 
"'That's funny,' my spirit would say to itself as it winged its way back to the netherworld after another fruitless Dent-ended venture into the land of the living, 'that man who just ran over me as I was hopping across the road to my favourite pond looked a little familiar...' And gradually I got to piece it together, Dent, you multiple- me-murderer!" 
The echoes of his voice roared up and down the corridors. Arthur stood silent and cold, his head shaking with disbelief. 
"Here's the moment, Dent," shrieked the voice, now reaching a feverish pitch of hatred, "here's the moment when at last I knew!" 
It was indescribably hideous, the thing that suddenly opened up in front of Arthur, making him gasp and gargle with horror, but here's an attempt at a description of how hideous it was. It was a huge palpitating wet cave with a vast, slimy, rough, whale-like creature 
rolling around it and sliding over monstrous white tombstones. High above the cave rose a vast promontory in which could be seen the dark recesses of two further fearful caves, which... 
Arthur Dent suddenly realized that he was looking at his own mouth, when his attention was meant to be directed at the live oyster that was being tipped helplessly into it. 
He staggered back with a cry and averted his eyes. 
When he looked again the appalling apparition had gone. The corridor was dark and, briefly, silent. He was alone with his thoughts. They were extremely unpleasant thoughts and would rather have had a chaperone. 
The next noise, when it came, was the low heavy roll of a large section of wall trundling aside, revealing, for the moment, just dark blackness behind it. Arthur looked into it in much the same way that a mouse looks into a dark dog-kennel. 
And the voice spoke to him again. 
"Tell me it was a coincidence, Dent," it said. "I dare you to tell me it was a coincidence!" 
"It was a coincidence," said Arthur quickly. 
"It was not!" came the answering bellow. 
"It was," said Arthur, "it was..." 
"If it was a coincidence, then my name," roared the voice, "is not Agrajag!!!" 
"And presumably," said Arthur, "you would claim that that was your name." 
"Yes!" hissed Agrajag, as if he had just completed a rather deft syllogism. 
"Well, I'm afraid it was still a coincidence," said Arthur. 
"Come in here and say that!" howled the voice, in sudden apoplexy again. 
Arthur walked in and said that it was a coincidence, or at least, he nearly said that it was a coincidence. His tongue rather lost its footing towards the end of the last word because the lights came up and revealed what it was he had walked into. 
It was a Cathedral of Hate. 
It was the product of a mind that was not merely twisted, but actually sprained. 
It was huge. It was horrific.â¨It had a Statue in it.â¨We will come to the Statue in a moment. 
The vast, incomprehensibly vast chamber looked as if it had been carved out of the inside of a mountain, and the reason for this was that that was precisely what it had been carved out of. It seemed to Arthur to spin sickeningly round his head as he stood and gaped at it. 
It was black. 
Where it wasn't black you were inclined to wish that it was, because the colours with which some of the unspeakable details were picked out ranged horribly across the whole spectrum of eye-defying colours from Ultra Violent to Infra Dead, taking in Liver Purple, Loathsome Lilac, Matter Yellow, Burnt hombre and Gan Green on the way. 
The unspeakable details which these colours picked out were gargoyles which would have put Francis Bacon off his lunch. 
The gargoyles all looked inwards from the walls, from the pillars, from the flying buttresses, from the choir stalls, towards the Statue, to which we will come in a moment. 
And if the gargoyles would have put Francis Bacon off his lunch, then it was clear from the gargoyles' faces that the Statue would have put them off theirs, had they been alive to eat it, which they weren't, and had anybody tried to serve them some, which they wouldn't. 
Around the monumental walls were vast engraved stone tablets in memory of those who had fallen to Arthur Dent. 
The names of some of those commemorated were underlined and had asterisks against them. So, for instance, the name of a cow which had been slaughtered and of which Arthur Dent had happened to eat a fillet steak would have the plainest engraving, whereas the name of a fish which Arthur had himself caught and then decided he didn't like and left on the side of the plate had a double underlining, three sets of asterisks and a bleeding dagger added as decoration, just to make the point. 
And what was most disturbing about all this, apart from the Statue, to which we are, by degrees, coming, was the very clear implication 
that all these people and creatures were indeed the same person, over and over again. 
And it was equally clear that this person was, however unfairly, extremely upset and annoyed. 
In fact it would be fair to say that he had reached a level of annoyance the like of which had never been seen in the Universe. It was an annoyance of epic proportions, a burning searing flame of annoyance, an annoyance which now spanned the whole of time and space in its infinite umbrage. 
And this annoyance had been given its fullest expression in the Statue in the centre of all this monstrosity, which was a statue of Arthur Dent, and an unflattering one. Fifty feet tall if it was an inch, there was not an inch of it which wasn't crammed with insult to its subject matter, and fifty feet of that sort of thing would be enough to make any subject feel bad. From the small pimple on the side of his nose to the poorish cut of his dressing gown, there was no aspect of Arthur Dent which wasn't lambasted and vilified by the sculptor. 
Arthur appeared as a gorgon, an evil, rapacious, ravenning, bloodied ogre, slaughtering his way through an innocent one-man Universe. 
With each of the thirty arms which the sculptor in a fit of artistic fervour had decided to give him, he was either braining a rabbit, swatting a fly, pulling a wishbone, picking a flea out of his hair, or doing something which Arthur at first looking couldn't quite identify. 
His many feet were mostly stamping on ants. 
Arthur put his hands over his eyes, hung his head and shook it slowly from side to side in sadness and horror at the craziness of things. 
And when he opened his eyes again, there in front of him stood the figure of the man or creature, or whatever it was, that he had supposedly been persecuting all this time. 
"HhhhhhrrrrrraaaaaaHHHHHH!" said Agrajag. 
He, or it, or whatever, looked like a mad fat bat. He waddled slowly around Arthur, and poked at him with bent claws. 
"Look...!" protested Arthur. 
"HhhhhhrrrrrraaaaaaHHHHHH!!!" explained Agrajag, and Arthur reluctantly accepted this on the grounds that he was rather frightened by this hideous and strangely wrecked apparition. 
Agrajag was black, bloated, wrinkled and leathery. 
His batwings were somehow more frightening for being the pathetic broken floundering things they were that if they had been strong, muscular beaters of the air. The frightening thing was probably the tenacity of his continued existence against all the physical odds. 
He had the most astounding collection of teeth. 
They looked as if they each came from a completely different animal, and they were ranged around his mouth at such bizarre angles it seemed that if he ever actually tried to chew anything he'd lacerate half his own face along with it, and possibly put an eye out as well. 
Each of his three eyes was small and intense and looked about as sane as a fish in a privet bush. 
"I was at a cricket match," he rasped. 
This seemed on the face of it such a preposterous notion that Arthur practically choked. 
"Not in this body," screeched the creature, "not in this body! This is my last body. My last life. This is my revenge body. My kill-Arthur- Dent body. My last chance. I had to fight to get it, too." 
"But..." 
"I was at," roared Agrajag, "a cricket match! I had a weak heart condition, but what, I said to my wife, can happen to me at a cricket match? As I'm watching, what happens? 
"Two people quite maliciously appear out of thin air just in front of me. The last thing I can't help but notice before my poor heart gives out in shock is that one of them is Arthur Dent wearing a rabbit bone in his beard. Coincidence?" 
"Yes," said Arthur. 
"Coincidence?" screamed the creature, painfully thrashing its broken wings, and opening a short gash on its right cheek with a particularly nasty tooth. On closer examination, such as he'd been hoping to avoid, Arthur noticed that much of Agrajag's face was covered with ragged strips of black sticky plasters. 
He backed away nervously. He tugged at his beard. He was appalled to discover that in fact he still had the rabbit bone in it. He pulled it out and threw it away. 
"Look," he said, "it's just fate playing silly buggers with you. With me. With us. It's a complete coincidence." 
"What have you got against me, Dent?" snarled the creature, advancing on him in a painful waddle. 
"Nothing," insisted Arthur, "honestly, nothing." 
Agrajag fixed him with a beady stare. 
"Seems a strange way to relate to somebody you've got nothing against, killing them all the time. Very curious piece of social interaction, I would call that. I'd also call it a lie!" 
"But look," said Arthur, "I'm very sorry. There's been a terrible misunderstanding. I've got to go. Have you got a clock? I'm meant to be helping save the Universe." He backed away still further. 
Agrajag advanced still further. 
"At one point," he hissed, "at one point, I decided to give up. Yes, I would not come back. I would stay in the netherworld. And what happened?" 
Arthur indicated with random shakes of his head that he had no idea and didn't want to have one either. He found he had backed up against the cold dark stone that had been carved by who knew what Herculean effort into a monstrous travesty of his bedroom slippers. He glanced up at his own horrendously parodied image towering above him. He was still puzzled as to what one of his hands was meant to be doing. 
"I got yanked involuntarily back into the physical world," pursued Agrajag, "as a bunch of petunias. In, I might add, a bowl. This particularly happy little lifetime started off with me, in my bowl, unsupported, three hundred miles above the surface of a particularly grim planet. Not a naturally tenable position for a bowl of petunias, you might think. And you'd be right. That life ended a very short while later, three hundred miles lower. In, I might add, the fresh wreckage of a whale. My spirit brother." 
He leered at Arthur with renewed hatred. 
"On the way down," he snarled, "I couldn't help noticing a flashy- looking white spaceship. And looking out of a port on this flashy- looking spaceship was a smug-looking Arthur Dent. Coincidence?!!" 
"Yes!" yelped Arthur. He glanced up again, and realized that the arm that had puzzled him was represented as wantonly calling into existence a bowl of doomed petunias. This was not a concept which leapt easily to the eye. 
"I must go," insisted Arthur. 
"You may go," said Agrajag, "after I have killed you." 
"No, that won't be any use," explained Arthur, beginning to climb up the hard stone incline of his carved slipper, "because I have to save the Universe, you see. I have to find a Silver Bail, that's the point. Tricky thing to do dead." 
"Save the Universe!" spat Agrajag with contempt. "You should have thought of that before you started your vendetta against me! What about the time you were on Stavromula Beta and someone..." 
"I've never been there," said Arthur. 
"... tried to assassinate you and you ducked. Who do you think the bullet hit? What did you say?" 
"Never been there," repeated Arthur. "What are you talking about? I have to go." 
Agrajag stopped in his tracks. 
"You must have been there. You were responsible for my death there, as everywhere else. An innocent bystander!" He quivered. 
"I've never heard of the place," insisted Arthur. "I've certainly never had anyone try to assassinate me. Other than you. Perhaps I go there later, do you think?" 
Agrajag blinked slowly in a kind of frozen logical horror. 
"You haven't been to Stavromula Beta... yet?" he whispered. 
"No," said Arthur, "I don't know anything about the place. Certainly never been to it, and don't have any plans to go." 
"Oh, you go there all right," muttered Agrajag in a broken voice, "you go there all right. Oh zark!" he tottered, and stared wildly about him at his huge Cathedral of Hate. "I've brought you here too soon!" 
He started to scream and bellow. "I've brought you here too zarking soon!" 
Suddenly he rallied, and turned a baleful, hating eye on Arthur. 
"I'm going to kill you anyway!" he roared. "Even if it's a logical impossibility I'm going to zarking well try! I'm going to blow this whole mountain up!" He screamed, "Let's see you get out of this one, Dent!" 
He rushed in a painful waddling hobble to what appeared to be a small black sacrificial altar. He was shouting so wildly now that he was really carving his face up badly. Arthur leaped down from his vantage place on the carving of his own foot and ran to try to restrain the three-quarters-crazed creature. 
He leaped upon him, and brought the strange monstrosity crashing down on top of the altar. 
Agrajag screamed again, thrashed wildly for a brief moment, and turned a wild eye on Arthur. 
"You know what you've done?" he gurgled painfully. "You've only gone and killed me again. I mean, what do you want from me, blood?" 
He thrashed again in a brief apoplectic fit, quivered, and collapsed, smacking a large red button on the altar as he did so. 
Arthur started with horror and fear, first at what he appeared to have done, and then at the loud sirens and bells that suddenly shattered the air to announce some clamouring emergency. He stared wildly around him. 
The only exit appeared to be the way he came in. He peltedâ¨towards it, throwing away the nasty fake leopard-skin bag as he did so. 
He dashed randomly, haphazardly through the labyrinthine maze, he seemed to be pursued more and more fiercely by claxons, sirens, flashing lights. 
Suddenly, he turned a corner and there was a light in front of him. It wasn't flashing. It was daylight. 
Chapter 17 
Although it has been said that on Earth alone in our Galaxy is Krikkit (or cricket) treated as fit subject for a game, and that for this reason the Earth has been shunned, this does only apply to our Galaxy, and more specifically to our dimension. In some of the higher dimensions they feel they can more or less please themselves, and have been playing a peculiar game called Brockian Ultra-Cricket for whatever their transdimensional equivalent of billions of years is. 
"Let's be blunt, it's a nasty game" (says The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) "but then anyone who has been to any of the higher dimensions will know that they're a pretty nasty heathen lot up there who should just be smashed and done in, and would be, too, if anyone could work out a way of firing missiles at right-angles to reality." 
This is another example of the fact that The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy will employ anybody who wants to walk straight in off the street and get ripped off, especially if they happen to walk in off the street during the afternoon, when very few of the regular staff are there. 
There is a fundamental point here. 
The history of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is one of idealism, struggle, despair, passion, success, failure, and enormously long lunch-breaks. 
The earliest origins of the Guide are now, along with most of its financial records, lost in the mists of time. 
For other, and more curious theories about where they are lost, see below. 
Most of the surviving stories, however, speak of a founding editor called Hurling Frootmig. 
Hurling Frootmig, it is said, founded the Guide, established its fundamental principles of honesty and idealism, and went bust. 
There followed many years of penury and heart searching during which he consulted friends, sat in darkened rooms in illegal states of mind, thought about this and that, fooled about with weights, and then, after a chance encounter with the Holy Lunching Friars of Voondon (who claimed that just as lunch was at the centre of a man's temporal day, and man's temporal day could be seen as an analogy for his spiritual life, so Lunch should 
(a) be seen as the centre of a man's spiritual life, and 
(b) be held in jolly nice restaurants), he refounded the Guide, laid down its fundamental principles of honesty and idealism and where you could stuff them both, and led the Guide on to its first major commercial success. 
He also started to develop and explore the role of the editorial lunch-break which was subsequently to play such a crucial part in the Guide's history, since it meant that most of the actual work got done by any passing stranger who happened to wander into the empty offices on an afternoon and saw something worth doing. 
Shortly after this, the Guide was taken over by Megadodo Publications of Ursa Minor Beta, thus putting the whole thing on a very sound financial footing, and allowing the fourth editor, Lig Lury Jr, to embark on lunch-breaks of such breathtaking scope that even the efforts of recent editors, who have started undertaking sponsored lunch-breaks for charity, seem like mere sandwiches in comparison. 
In fact, Lig never formally resigned his editorship he merely left his office late one morning and has never since returned. Though well over a century has now passed, many members of the Guide staff still retain the romantic notion that he has simply popped out for a ham croissant, and will yet return to put in a solid afternoon's work. 
Strictly speaking, all editors since Lig Lury Jr have therefore been designated Acting Editors, and Lig's desk is still preserved the way he left it, with the addition of a small sign which says "LIG LURY JR, EDITOR, MISSING, PRESUMED FED". 
Some very scurrilous and subversive sources hint at the idea thatâ¨Lig actually perished in the Guide's first extraordinary experiments in alternative book-keeping. Very little is known of this, and less still said. Anyone who even notices, let alone calls attention to, the curious but utter coincidental and meaningless fact that every world on which the Guide has ever set up an accounting department has shortly 
afterwards perished in warfare or some natural disaster, is liable to get sued to smithereens. 
It is an interesting though utterly unrelated fact that the two or three days prior to the demolition of the planet Earth to make way for a new hyperspace bypass saw a dramatic upsurge in the number of UFO sightings there, not only above Lords Cricket Ground in St. John's Wood, London, but also above Glastonbury in Somerset. 
Glastonbury had long been associated with myths of ancient kings, witchcraft, ley-lines an wart curing, and had now been selected as the site for the new Hitchhiker's Guide financial records office, and indeed, ten years' worth of financial records were transferred to a magic hill just outside the city mere hours before the Vogons arrived. 
None of these facts, however strange or inexplicable, is as strange or inexplicable as the rules of the game of Brockian Ultra-Cricket, as played in the higher dimensions. A full set of rules is so massively complicated that the only time they were all bound together in a single volume, they underwent gravitational collapse and became a Black Hole. 
A brief summary, however, is as follows: 
Rule One: Grow at least three extra legs. You won't need them, but it keeps the crowds amused. 
Rule Two: Find one good Brockian Ultra-Cricket player. Clone him off a few times. This saves an enormous amount of tedious selection and training. 
Rule Three: Put your team and the opposing team in a large field and build a high wall round them. 
The reason for this is that, though the game is a major spectator sport, the frustration experienced by the audience at not actually being able to see what's going on leads them to imagine that it's a lot more exciting than it really is. A crowd that has just watched a rather humdrum game experiences far less life-affirmation than a crowd that believes it has just missed the most dramatic event in sporting history. 
Rule Four: Throw lots of assorted items of sporting equipment over the wall for the players. Anything will do cricket bats, basecube bats, tennis guns, skis, anything you can get a good swing with. 
Rule Five: The players should now lay about themselves for all they are worth with whatever they find to hand. Whenever a player scores 
a "hit" on another player, he should immediately run away and apologize from a safe distance. 
Apologies should be concise, sincere and, for maximum clarity and points, delivered through a megaphone. 
Rule Six: The winning team shall be the first team that wins. 
Curiously enough, the more the obsession with the game grows in the higher dimensions, the less it is actually played, since most of the competing teams are now in a state of permanent warfare with each other over the interpretation of these rules. This is all for the best, because in the long run a good solid war is less psychologically damaging than a protracted game of Brockian Ultra-Cricket. 
Chapter 18 
As Arthur ran darting, dashing and panting down the side of the mountain he suddenly felt the whole bulk of the mountain move very, very slightly beneath him. There was a rumble, a roar, and a slight blurred movement, and a lick of heat in the distance behind and above him. He ran in a frenzy of fear. The land began to slide, and he suddenly felt the force of the word "landslide" in a way which had never been apparent to him before. It had always just been a word to him, but now he was suddenly and horribly aware that sliding is a strange and sickening thing for land to do. It was doing it with him on it. He felt ill with fear and shaking. The ground slid, the mountain slurred, he slipped, he fell, he stood, he slipped again and ran. The avalance began. 
Stones, then rocks, then boulders which pranced past him like clumsy puppies, only much, much bigger, much, much harder and heavier, and almost infinitely more likely to kill you if they fell on you. His eyes danced with them, his feet danced with the dancing ground. He ran as if running was a terrible sweating sickness, his heart pounded to the rhythm of the pounding geological frenzy around him. 
The logic of the situation, i.e. that he was clearly bound to survive if the next foreshadowed incident in the saga of his inadvertent persecution of Agrajag was to happen, was utterly failing to impinge itself on his mind or exercise any restraining influence on him at this time. He ran with the fear of death in him, under him, over him and grabbing hold of his hair. 
And suddenly he tripped again and was hurled forward by his considerable momentum. But just at the moment that he was about to hit the ground astoundingly hard he saw lying directly in front of him a small navy-blue holdall that he knew for a fact he had lost in the baggage-retrieval system at Athens airport some ten years in his personal time-scale previously, and in his astonishment he missed the ground completely and bobbed off into the air with his brain singing. 
What he was doing was this: he was flying. He glanced around him in surprise, but there could be no doubt that that was what he was doing. No part of him was touching the ground, and no part of him was even approaching it. He was simply floating there with boulders hurtling through the air around him. 
He could now do something about that. Blinking with the non- effort of it he wafted higher into the air, and now the boulders were hurtling through the air beneath him. 
He looked downwards with intense curiosity. Between him and the shivering ground were now some thirty feet of empty air, empty that is if you discounted the boulders which didn't stay in it for long, but bounded downwards in the iron grip of the law of gravity; the same law which seemed, all of a sudden, to have given Arthur a sabbatical. 
It occurred to him almost instantly, with the instinctive correctness that self-preservation instils in the mind, that he mustn't try to think about it, that if he did, the law of gravity would suddenly glance sharply in his direction and demand to know what the hell he thought he was doing up there, and all would suddenly be lost. 
So he thought about tulips. It was difficult, but he did. He thought about the pleasing firm roundness of the bottom of tulips, he thought about the interesting variety of colours they came in, and wondered what proportion of the total number of tulips that grew, or had grown, on the Earth would be found within a radius of one mile from a windmill. After a while he got dangerously bored with this train of thought, felt the air slipping away beneath him, felt that he was drifting down into the paths of the bouncing boulders that he was trying so hard not to think about, so he thought about Athens airport for a bit and that kept him usefully annoyed for about five minutes at the end of which he was startled to discover that he was now floating about two hundred yards above the ground. 
He wondered for a moment how he was going to get back down to it, but instantly shied away from that area of speculation again, and tried to look at the situation steadily. 
He was flying, What was he going to do about it? He looked back down at the ground. He didn't look at it hard, but did his best just to give it an idle glance, as it were, in passing. There were a couple of things he couldn't help noticing. One was that the eruption of the mountain seemed now to have spent itself there was a crater just a 
little way beneath the peak, presumably where the rock had caved in on top of the huge cavernous cathedral, the statue of himself, and the sadly abused figure of Agrajag. 
The other was his hold-all, the one he had lost at Athens airport. It was sitting pertly on a piece of clear ground, surrounded by exhausted boulders but apparently hit by none of them. Why this should be he could not speculate, but since this mystery was completely overshadowed by the monstrous impossibility of the bag's being there in the first place, it was not a speculation he really felt strong enough for anyway. The thing is, it was there. And the nasty, fake leopard-skin bag seemed to have disappeared, which was all to the good, if not entirely to the explicable. 
He was faced with the fact that he was going to have to pick the thing up. Here he was, flying along two hundred yards above the surface of an alien planet the name of which he couldn't even remember. He could not ignore the plaintive posture of this tiny piece of what used to be his life, here, so many light-years from the pulverized remains of his home. 
Furthermore, he realized, the bag, if it was still in the state in which he lost it, would contain a can which would have in it the only Greek olive oil still surviving in the Universe. 
Slowly, carefully, inch by inch, he began to bob downwards, swinging gently from side to side like a nervous sheet of paper feeling its way towards the ground. 
It went well, he was feeling good. The air supported him, but let him through. Two minutes later he was hovering a mere two feet above the bag, and was faced with some difficult decision. He bobbed there lightly. He frowned, but again, as lightly as he could. 
If he picked the bag up, could he carry it? Mightn't the extra weight just pull him straight to the ground? 
Mightn't the mere act of touching something on the ground suddenly discharge whatever mysterious force it was that was holding him in the air? 
Mightn't he be better off just being sensible at this point and stepping out of the air, back on to the ground for a moment or two? 
If he did, would he ever be able to fly again? 
The sensation, when he allowed himself to be aware of it, was so quietly ecstatic that he could not bear the thought of losing it, perhaps for ever. With this worry in mind he bobbed upwards a little again, just to try the feel of it, the surprising and effortless movement of it. He bobbed, he floated. He tried a little swoop. 
The swoop was terrific. With his arms spread out in front of him, his hair and dressing gown streaming out behind him, he dived down out of the sky, bellied along a body of air about two feet from the ground and swung back up again, catching himself at the top of the swing and holding. Just holding. He stayed there. 
It was wonderful. 
And that, he realized, was the way of picking up the bag. He would swoop down and catch hold of it just at the point of the upswing. He would carry it on up with him. He might wobble a bit, but he was certain that he could hold it. 
He tried one or two more practice swoops, and they got better and better. The air on his face, the bounce and woof of his body, all combined to make him feel an intoxication of the spirit that he hadn't felt since, since well as far as he could work out, since he was born. He drifted away on the breeze and surveyed the countryside, which was, he discovered, pretty nasty. It had a wasted ravaged look. He decided not to look at it any more. He would just pick up the bag and then... he didn't know what he was going to do after he had picked up the bag. He decided he would just pick up the bag and see where things went from there. 
He judged himself against the wind, pushed up against it and turned around. He floated on its body. He didn't realize, but his body was willoming at this point. 
He ducked down under the airstream, dipped and dived. 
The air threw itself past him, he thrilled through it. The ground wobbled uncertainly, straightened its ideas out and rose smoothly up to meet him, offering the bag, its cracked plastic handles up towards him. 
Halfway down there was a sudden dangerous moment when he could no longer believe he was doing this, and therefore he very nearly wasn't, but he recovered himself in time, skimmed over the ground, slipped an arm smoothly through the handles of the bag, and 
began to climb back up, couldn't make it and all of a sudden collapsed, bruised, scratched and shaking in the stony ground. 
He staggered instantly to his feet and swayed hopelessly around, swinging the bag round him in agony of grief and disappointment. 
His feet, suddenly, were stuck heavily to the ground in the way they always had been. His body seemed like an unwieldy sack of potatoes that reeled stumbling against the ground, his mind had all the lightness of a bag of lead. 
He sagged and swayed and ached with giddiness. He tried hopelessly to run, but his legs were suddenly too weak. He tripped and flopped forward. At that moment he remembered that in the bag he was now carrying was not only a can of Greek olive oil but a duty- free allowance of retsina, and in the pleasurable shock of that realization he failed to notice for at least ten seconds that he was now flying again. 
He whooped and cried with relief and pleasure, and sheer physical delight. He swooped, he wheeled, he skidded and whirled through the air. Cheekily he sat on an updraught and went through the contents of the hold-all. He felt the way he imagined an angel must feel during its celebrated dance on the head of a pin whilst being counted by philosophers. He laughed with pleasure at the discovery that the bag did in fact contain the olive oil and the retsina as well as a pair of cracked sunglasses, some sand-filled swimming trunks, some creased postcards of Santorini, a large and unsightly towel, some interesting stones, and various scraps of paper with the addresses of people he was relieved to think he would never meet again, even if the reason why was a sad one. He dropped the stones, put on the sunglasses, and let the pieces of paper whip away in the wind. 
Ten minutes later, drifting idly through a cloud, he got a large and extremely disreputable cocktail party in the small of the back. 
Chapter 19 
The longest and most destructive party ever held is now into its fourth generation, and still no one shows any signs of leaving. Somebody did once look at his watch, but that was eleven years ago, and there has been no follow-up. 
The mess is extraordinary, and has to be seen to be believed, but if you don't have any particular need to believe it, then don't go and look, because you won't enjoy it. 
There have recently been some bangs and flashes up in the clouds, and there is one theory that this is a battle being fought between the fleets of several rival carpet-cleaning companies who are hovering over the thing like vultures, but you shouldn't believe anything you hear at parties, and particularly not anything you hear at this one. 
One of the problems, and it's one which is obviously going to get worse, is that all the people at the party are either the children or the grandchildren or the great-grandchildren of the people who wouldn't leave in the first place, and because of all the business about selective breeding and regressive genes and so on, it means that all the people now at the party are either absolutely fanatical partygoers, or gibbering idiots, or, more and more frequently, both. 
Either way, it means that, genetically speaking, each succeeding generation is now less likely to leave than the preceding one. 
So other factors come into operation, like when the drink is going to run out. 
Now, because of certain things which have happened which seemed like a good idea at the time (and one of the problems with a party which never stops is that all the things which only seem like a good idea at parties continue to seem like good ideas), that point seems still to be a long way off. 
One of the things which seemed like a good idea at the time was that the party should fly not in the normal sense that parties are meant to fly, but literally. 
One night, long ago, a band of drunken astro-engineers of the first generation clambered round the building digging this, fixing that, banging very hard on the other and when the sun rose the following morning, it was startled to find itself shining on a building full of happy drunken people which was now floating like a young and uncertain bird over the treetops. 
Not only that, but the flying party had also managed to arm itself rather heavily. If they were going to get involved in any petty arguments with wine merchants, they wanted to make sure they had might on their side. 
The transition from full-time cocktail party to part-time raiding party came with ease, and did much to add that extra bit of zest and swing to the whole affair which was badly needed at this point because of the enormous number of times that the band had already played all the numbers it knew over the years. 
They looted, they raided, they held whole cities for ransom for fresh supplies of cheese crackers, avocado dip, spare ribs and wine and spirits, which would now get piped aboard from floating tankers. 
The problem of when the drink is going to run out is, however, going to have to be faced one day. 
The planet over which they are floating is no longer the planet it was when they first started floating over it. 
It is in bad shape. 
The party had attacked and raided an awful lot of it, and no one has ever succeeded in hitting it back because of the erratic and unpredictable way in which it lurches round the sky. 
It is one hell of a party.â¨It is also one hell of a thing to get hit by in the small of the back. 
Chapter 20 
Arthur lay floundering in pain on a piece of ripped and dismembered reinforced concrete, flicked at by wisps of passing cloud and confused by the sounds of flabby merrymaking somewhere indistinctly behind him. 
There was a sound he couldn't immediately identify, partly because he didn't know the tune "I Left my Leg in Jaglan Beta" and partly because the band playing it were very tired, and some members of it were playing it in three-four time, some in four-four, and some in a kind of pie-eyed r2, each according to the amount of sleep he'd managed to grab recently. 
He lay, panting heavily in the wet air, and tried feeling bits of himself to see where he might be hurt. Wherever he touched himself, he encountered a pain. After a short while he worked out that this was because it was his hand that was hurting. He seemed to have sprained his wrist. His back, too, was hurting, but he soon satisfied himself that he was not badly hurt, but just bruised and a little shaken, as who wouldn't be? He couldn't understand what a building wouldâ¨be doing flying through the clouds. 
On the other hand, he would have been a little hard-pressed to come up with any convincing explanation of his own presence, so he decided that he and the building were just going to have to accept each other. He looked up from where he was lying. A wall of pale but stained stone slabs rose up behind him, the building proper. He seemed to be stretched out on some sort of ledge or lip which extended outwards for about three or four feet all the way around. It was a hunk of the ground in which the party building had had its foundations, and which it had taken along with itself to keep itself bound together at the bottom end. 
Nervously, he stood up and, suddenly, looking out over the edge, he felt nauseous with vertigo. He pressed himself back against the wall, wet with mist and sweat. His head was swimming freestyle, but someone in his stomach was doing the butterfly. 
Even though he had got up here under his own power, he could now not even bear to contemplate the hideous drop in front of him. He was not about to try his luck jumping. He was not about to move an inch closer to the edge. 
Clutching his hold-all he edged along the wall, hoping to find a doorway in. The solid weight of the can of olive oil was a great reassurance to him. 
He was edging in the direction of the nearest corner, in the hope that the wall around the corner might offer more in the way of entrances than this one, which offered none. 
The unsteadiness of the building's flight made him feel sick with fear, and after a short while he took the towel from out of his hold-all and did something with it which once again justified its supreme position in the list of useful things to take with you when you hitch- hike round the Galaxy. He put it over his head so he wouldn't have to see what he was doing. 
His feet edged along the ground. His outstretched hand edged along the wall. 
Finally he came to the corner, and as his hand rounded the corner it encountered something which gave him such a shock that he nearly fell straight off. It was another hand. 
The two hands gripped each other. 
He desperately wanted to use his other hand to pull the towel back from his eyes, but it was holding the hold-all with the olive oil, the retsina and the postcards from Santorini, and he very much didn't want to put it down. 
He experienced one of those "self" moments, one of those moments when you suddenly turn around and look at yourself and think "Who am I? What am I up to? What have I achieved? Am I doing well?" He whimpered very slightly. 
He tried to free his hand, but he couldn't. The other hand was holding his tightly. He had no recourse but to edge onwards towards the corner. He leaned around it and shook his head in an attempt to dislodge the towel. This seemed to provoke a sharp cry of some unfashionable emotion from the owner of the other hand. 
The towel was whipped from his head and he found his eyes peering into those of Ford Prefect. Beyond him stood Slartibartfast, 
and beyond them he could clearly see a porchway and a large closed door. 
They were both pressed back against the wall, eyes wild with terror as they stared out into the thick blind cloud around them, and tried to resist the lurching and swaying of the building. 
"Where the zarking photon have you been?" hissed Ford, panic stricken. 
"Er, well," stuttered Arthur, not really knowing how to sum it all up that briefly. "Here and there. What are you doing here?" 
Ford turned his wild eyes on Arthur again.â¨"They won't let us in without a bottle," he hissed. 
Chapter 21 
The first thing Arthur noticed as they entered into the thick of the party, apart from the noise, the suffocating heat, the wild profusion of colours that protuded dimly through the atmosphere of heavy smoke, the carpets thick with ground glass, ash and avocado droppings, and the small group of pterodactyl-like creatures in lurex who descended on his cherished bottle of retsina, squawking, "A new pleasure, a new pleasure", was Trillian being chatted up by a Thunder God. 
"Didn't I see you at Milliways?" he was saying. 
"Were you the one with the hammer?" 
"Yes. I much prefer it here. So much less reputable, so much more fraught." 
Squeals of some hideous pleasure rang around the room, the outer dimensions of which were invisible through the heaving throng of happy, noisy creatures, cheerfully yelling things that nobody could hear at each other and occasionally having crises. 
"Seems fun," said Trillian. "What did you say, Arthur?" 
"I said, how the hell did you get here?" 
"I was a row of dots flowing randomly through the Universe. Have you met Thor? He makes thunder." 
"Hello," said Arthur. "I expect that must be very interesting." "Hi," said Thor. "It is. Have you got a drink?"â¨"Er, no actually..."â¨"Then why don't you go and get one?" 
"See you later, Arthur," said Trillian.â¨Something jogged Arthur's mind, and he looked around huntedly. "Zaphod isn't here, is he?" he said.â¨"See you," said Trillian firmly, "later." 
Thor glared at him with hard coal-black eyes, his beard bristled, what little light was there was in the place mustered its forces briefly to glint menacingly off the horns of his helmet. 
He took Trillian's elbow in his extremely large hand and the muscles in his upper arm moved around each other like a couple of Volkswagens parking. 
He led her away. 
"One of the interesting things about being immortal," he said, "is..." 
"One of the interesting things about space," Arthur heard Slartibartfast saying to a large and voluminous creature who looked like someone losing a fight with a pink duvet and was gazing raptly at the old man's deep eyes and silver beard, "is how dull it is." 
"Dull?" said the creature, and blinked her rather wrinkled and bloodshot eyes. 
"Yes," said Slartibartfast, "staggeringly dull. Bewilderingly so. You see, there's so much of it and so little in it. Would you like me to quote some statistics?" 
"Er, well..." 
"Please, I would like to. They, too, are quite sensationally dull." 
"I'll come back and hear them in a moment," she said, patting him on the arm, lifted up her skirts like a hovercraft and moved off into the heaving crown. 
"I thought she'd never go," growled the old man. "Come, Earthman..." 
"Arthur." 
"We must find the Silver Bail, it is here somewhere." 
"Can't we just relax a little?" Arthur said. "I've had a tough day. Trillian's here, incidentally, she didn't say how, it probably doesn't matter." 
"Think of the danger to the Universe..." 
"The Universe," said Arthur, "is big enough and old enough to look after itself for half an hour. All right," he added, in response to Slartibartfast's increasing agitation, "I'll wander round and see if anybody's seen it." 
"Good, good," said Slartibartfast, "good. " He plunged into the crowd himself, and was told to relax by everybody he passed. 
"Have you seen a bail anywhere?" said Arthur to a little man who seemed to be standing eagerly waiting to listen to somebody. "It's made of silver, vitally important for the future safety of the Universe, and about this long." 
"No," said the enthusiastically wizened little man, "but do have a drink and tell me all about it." 
Ford Prefect writhed past, dancing a wild, frenetic and not entirely unobscene dance with someone who looked as if she was wearing Sydney Opera House on her head. He was yelling a futile conversation at her above the din. 
"I like that hat!" he bawled. "What?"â¨"I said, I like the hat."â¨"I'm not wearing a hat." "Well, I like the head, then." "What?" 
"I said, I like the head. Interesting bone-structure." 
"What?" 
Ford worked a shrug into the complex routine of other movements he was performing. 
"I said, you dance great," he shouted, "just don't nod so much." 
"What?" 
"It's just that every time you nod," said Ford, "... ow!" he added as his partner nodded forward to say "What?" and once again pecked him sharply on the forehead with the sharp end of her swept-forward skull. 
"My planet was blown up one morning," said Arthur, who had found himself quite unexpectedly telling the little man his life story or, at least, edited highlights of it, "that's why I'm dressed like this, in my dressing gown. My planet was blown up with all my clothes in it, you see. I didn't realize I'd be coming to a party." 
The little man nodded enthusiastically. 
"Later, I was thrown off a spaceship. Still in my dressing gown. Rather than the space suit one would normally expect. Shortly after 
that I discovered that my planet had originally been built for a bunch of mice. You can imagine how I felt about that. I was then shot at for a while and blown up. In fact I have been blown up ridiculously often, shot at, insulted, regularly disintegrated, deprived of tea, and recently I crashed into a swamp and had to spend five years in a damp cave." 
"Ah," effervesced the little man, "and did you have a wonderful time?" 
Arthur started to choke violently on his drink. 
"What a wonderful exciting cough," said the little man, quite startled by it, "do you mind if I join you?" 
And with that he launched into the most extraordinary and spectacular fit of coughing which caught Arthur so much by surprise that he started to choke violently, discovered he was already doing it and got thoroughly confused. 
Together they performed a lung-busting duet which went on for fully two minutes before Arthur managed to cough and splutter to a halt. 
"So invigorating," said the little man, panting and wiping tears from his eyes. "What an exciting life you must lead. Thank you very much." 
He shook Arthur warmly by the hand and walked off into the crowd. Arthur shook his head in astonishment. 
A youngish-looking man came up to him, an aggressive-looking type with a hook mouth, a lantern nose, and small beady little cheekbones. He was wearing black trousers, a black silk shirt open to what was presumably his navel, though Arthur had learnt never to make assumptions about the anatomies of the sort of people he tended to meet these days, and had all sorts of nasty dangly gold things hanging round his neck. He carried something in a black bag, and clearly wanted people to notice that he didn't want them to notice it. 
"Hey, er, did I hear you say your name just now?" he said. 
This was one of the many things that Arthur had told the enthusiastic little man. 
"Yes, it's Arthur Dent." 
The man seemed to be dancing slightly to some rhythm other than any of the several that the band were grimly pushing out. 
"Yeah," he said, "only there was a man in a mountain wanted to see you." 
"I met him." 
"Yeah, only he seemed pretty anxious about it, you know." 
"Yes, I met him." 
"Yeah, well I think you should know that." 
"I do. I met him." 
The man paused to chew a little gum. Then he clapped Arthur on the back. 
"OK," he said, "all right. I'm just telling you, right? Good night, good luck, win awards." 
"What?" said Arthur, who was beginning to flounder seriously at this point. 
"Whatever. Do what you do. Do it well." He made a sort of clucking noise with whatever he was chewing and then some vaguely dynamic gesture. 
"Why?" said Arthur. 
"Do it badly," said the man, "who cares? Who gives a shit?" The blood suddenly seemed to pump angrily into the man's face and he started to shout. 
"Why not go mad?" he said. "Go away, get off my back will you, guy. Just zark off!!!" 
"OK, I'm going," said Arthur hurriedly. 
"It's been real." The man gave a sharp wave and disappeared off into the throng. 
"What was that about?" said Arthur to a girl he found standing beside him. "Why did he tell me to win awards?" 
"Just showbiz talk," shrugged the girl. "He's just won an award at the Annual Ursa Minor Alpha Recreational Illusions Institute Awards Ceremony, and was hoping to be able to pass it off lightly, only you didn't mention it, so he couldn't." 
"Oh," said Arthur, "oh, well I'm sorry I didn't. What was it for?" 
"The Most Gratuitous Use Of The Word 'Fuck' In A Serious Screenplay. It's very prestigious." 
"I see," said Arthur, "yes, and what do you get for that?" 
"A Rory. It's just a small silver thing set on a large black base. What did you say?" 
"I didn't say anything. I was just about to ask what the silver..." "Oh, I thought you said 'wop'."â¨"Said what?"â¨"Wop." 
Chapter 22 
People had been dropping in on the party now for some years, fashionable gatecrashers from other worlds, and for some time it had occurred to the partygoers as they had looked out at their own world beneath them, with its wrecked cities, its ravaged avocado farms and blighted vineyards, its vast tracts of new desert, its seas full of biscuit crumbs and worse, that their world was in some tiny and almost imperceptible ways not quite as much fun as it had been. Some of them had begun to wonder if they could manage to stay sober for long enough to make the entire party spaceworthy and maybe take it off to some other people's worlds where the air might be fresher and give them fewer headaches. 
The few undernourished farmers who still managed to scratch out a feeble existence on the half-dead ground of the planet's surface would have been extremely pleased to hear this, but that day, as the party came screaming out of the clouds and the farmers looked up in haggard fear of yet another cheese-and-wine raid, it became clear that the party was not going to be going anywhere else for a while, that the party would soon be over. Very soon it would be time to gather up hats and coats and stagger blearily outside to find out what time of day it was, what time of year it was, and whether in any of this burnt and ravaged land there was a taxi going anywhere. 
The party was locked in a horrible embrace with a strange white spaceship which seemed to be half sticking through it. Together they were lurching, heaving and spinning their way round the sky in grotesque disregard of their own weight. 
The clouds parted. The air roared and leapt out of their way. 
The party and the Krikkit warship looked, in their writhings, a little like two ducks, one of which is trying to make a third duck inside the second duck, whilst the second duck is trying very hard to explain that it doesn't feel ready for a third duck right now, is uncertain that it would want any putative third duck to be made by this particular first 
duck anyway, and certainly not whilst it, the second duck, was busy flying. 
The sky sang and screamed with the rage of it all and buffeted the ground with shock waves. 
And suddenly, with a foop, the Krikkit ship was gone. 
The party blundered helplessly across the sky like a man leaning against an unexpectedly open door. It span and wobbled on its hover jets. It tried to right itself and wronged itself instead. It staggered back across the sky again. 
For a while these staggerings continued, but clearly they could not continue for long. The party was now a mortally wounded party. All the fun had gone out of it, as the occasional broken-backed pirouette could not disguise. 
The longer, at this point, that it avoided the ground, the heavier was going to be the crash when finally it hit it. 
Inside, things were not going well either. They were going monstrously badly, in fact, and people were hating it and saying so loudly. The Krikkit robots had been. 
They had removed the Award for The Most Gratuitous Use Of The Word 'Fuck' In A Serious Screenplay, and in its place had left a scene of devastation that left Arthur feeling almost as sick as a runner-up for a Rory. 
"We would love to stay and help," shouted Ford, picking his way over the mangled debris, "only we're not going to." 
The party lurched again, provoking feverish cries and groans from amongst the smoking wreckage. 
"We have to go and save the Universe, you see," said Ford. "And if that sounds like a pretty lame excuse, then you may be right. Either way, we're off." 
He suddenly came across an unopened bottle lying, miraculously unbroken, on the ground. 
"Do you mind if we take this?" he said. "You won't be needing it." 
He took a packet of potato crisps too. 
"Trillian?" shouted Arthur in a shocked and weakened voice. In the smoking mess he could see nothing. 
"Earthman, we must go," said Slartibartfast nervously. 
"Trillian?" shouted Arthur again. 
A moment or two later, Trillian staggered, shaking, into view, supported by her new friend the Thunder God. 
"The girl stays with me," said Thor. "There's a great party going on in Valhalla, we'll be flying off..." 
"Where were you when all this was going on?" said Arthur. 
"Upstairs," said Thor, "I was weighing her. Flying's a tricky business you see, you have to calculate wind..." 
"She comes with us," said Arthur. 
"Hey," said Trillian, "don't I..." 
"No," said Arthur, "you come with us." 
Thor looked at him with slowly smouldering eyes. He was making some point about godliness and it had nothing to do with being clean. 
"She comes with me," he said quietly. 
"Come on, Earthman," said Slartibartfast nervously, picking at Arthur's sleeve. 
"Come on, Slartibartfast," said Ford, picking at the old man's sleeve. Slartibartfast had the teleport device. 
The party lurched and swayed, sending everyone reeling, except for Thor and except for Arthur, who stared, shaking, into the Thunder God's black eyes. 
Slowly, incredibly, Arthur put up what appeared to be his tiny little fists. 
"Want to make something of it?" he said. 
"I beg your minuscule pardon?" roared Thor. 
"I said," repeated Arthur, and he could not keep the quavering out of his voice, "do you want to make something of it?" He waggled his fists ridiculously. 
Thor looked at him with incredulity. Then a little wisp of smoke curled upwards from his nostril. There was a tiny little flame in it too. 
He gripped his belt. 
He expanded his chest to make it totally clear that here was the sort of man you only dared to cross if you had a team of Sherpas with you. 
He unhooked the shaft of his hammer from his belt. He held it up in his hands to reveal the massive iron head. He thus cleared up any possible misunderstanding that he might merely have been carrying a telegraph pole around with him. 
"Do I want," he said, with a hiss like a river flowing through a steel mill, "to make something of it?" 
"Yes," said Arthur, his voice suddenly and extraordinarily strong and belligerent. He waggled his fists again, this time as if he meant it. 
"You want to step outside?" he snarled at Thor. 
"All right!" bellowed Thor, like an enraged bull (or in fact like an enraged Thunder God, which is a great deal more impressive), and did so. 
"Good," said Arthur, "that's got rid of him. Slarty, get us out of here." 
Chapter 23 
"All right," shouted Ford at Arthur, "so I'm a coward, the point is I'm still alive." They were back aboard the Starship Bistromath, so was Slartibartfast, so was Trillian. Harmony and concord were not. 
"Well, so am I alive, aren't I?" retaliated Arthur, haggard with adventure and anger. His eyebrows were leaping up and down as if they wanted to punch each other. 
"You damn nearly weren't," exploded Ford. 
Arthur turned sharply to Slartibartfast, who was sitting in his pilot couch on the flight deck gazing thoughtfully into the bottom of a bottle which was telling him something he clearly couldn't fathom. He appealed to him. 
"Do you think he understands the first word I've been saying?" he said, quivering with emotion. 
"I don't know," replied Slartibartfast, a little abstractedly. "I'm not sure," he added, glancing up very briefly, "that I do." He stared at his instruments with renewed vigor and bafflement. "You'll have to explain it to us again," he said. 
"Well..."â¨"But later. Terrible things are afoot."â¨He tapped the pseudo-glass of the bottle bottom. 
"We fared rather pathetically at the party, I'm afraid," he said, "and our only hope now is to try to prevent the robots from using the Key in the Lock. How in heaven we do that I don't know," he muttered. "Just have to go there, I suppose. Can't say I like the idea at all. Probably end up dead." 
"Where is Trillian anyway?" said Arthur with a sudden affectation of unconcern. What he had been angry about was that Ford had berated him for wasting time over all the business with the Thunder God when they could have been making a rather more rapid escape. Arthur's own opinion, and he had offered it for whatever anybody 
might have felt it was worth, was that he had been extraordinarily brave and resourceful. 
The prevailing view seemed to be that his opinion was not worth a pair of fetid dingo's kidneys. What really hurt, though, was that Trillian didn't seem to react much one way or the other and had wandered off somewhere. 
"And where are my potato crisps?" said Ford. 
"They are both," said Slartibartfast, without looking up, "in the Room of Informational Illusions. I think that your young lady friend is trying to understand some problems of Galactic history. I think the potato crisps are probably helping her." 
Chapter 24 
It is a mistake to think you can solve any major problems just with potatoes. 
For instance, there was once an insanely aggressive race of people called the Silastic Armorfiends of Striterax. That was just the name of their race. The name of their army was something quite horrific. Luckily they lived even further back in Galactic history than anything we have so far encountered twenty billion years ago when the Galaxy was young and fresh, and every idea worth fighting for was a new one. 
And fighting was what the Silastic Armorfiends of Striterax were good at, and being good at it, they did a lot. They fought their enemies (i.e. everybody else), they fought each other. Their planet was a complete wreck. The surface was littered with abandoned cities which were surrounded by abandoned war machines, which were in turn surrounded by deep bunkers in which the Silastic Armorfiends lived and squabbled with each other. 
The best way to pick a fight with a Silastic Armorfiend was just toâ¨be born. They didn't like it, they got resentful. And when an Armorfiend got resentful, someone got hurt. An exhausting way of life, one might think, but they did seem to have an awful lot of energy. 
The best way of dealing with a Silastic Armorfiend was to put him into a room of his own, because sooner or later he would simply beat himself up. 
Eventually they realized that this was something they were going to have to sort out, and they passed a law decreeing that anyone who had to carry a weapon as part of his normal Silastic work (policemen, security guards, primary school teachers, etc.) had to spend at least forty-five minutes every day punching a sack of potatoes in order to work off his or her surplus aggressions. 
For a while this worked well, until someone thought that it would be much more efficient and less time-consuming if they just shot the potatoes instead. 
This led to a renewed enthusiasm for shooting all sorts of things, and they all got very excited at the prospect of their first major war for weeks. 
Another achievement of the Silastic Armorfiends of Striterax is that they were the first race who ever managed to shock a computer. 
It was a gigantic spaceborne computer called Hactar, which to this day is remembered as one of the most powerful ever built. It was the first to be built like a natural brain, in that every cellular particle of it carried the pattern of the whole within it, which enabled it to think more flexibly and imaginatively, and also, it seemed, to be shocked. 
The Silastic Armorfiends of Striterax were engaged in one of their regular wars with the Strenuous Garfighters of Stug, and were not enjoying it as much as usual because it involved an awful lot of trekking through the Radiation Swamps of Cwulzenda, and across the Fire Mountains of Frazfraga, neither of which terrains they felt at home in. 
So when the Strangulous Stilettans of Jajazikstak joined in the fray and forced them to fight another front in the Gamma Caves of Carfrax and the Ice Storms of Varlengooten, they decided that enough was enough, and they ordered Hactar to design for them an Ultimate Weapon. 
"What do you mean," asked Hactar, "by Ultimate?" 
To which the Silastic Armorfiends of Striterax said, "Read a bloody dictionary," and plunged back into the fray. 
So Hactar designed an Ultimate Weapon. 
It was a very, very small bomb which was simply a junction box in hyperspace that would, when activated, connect the heart of every major sun with the heart of every other major sun simultaneously and thus turn the entire Universe in to one gigantic hyperspatial supernova. 
When the Silastic Armorfiends tried to use it to blow up a Strangulous Stilettan munitions dump in one of the Gamma Caves, they were extremely irritated that it didn't work, and said so. 
Hactar had been shocked by the whole idea. 
He tried to explain that he had been thinking about this Ultimate Weapon business, and had worked out that there was no conceivable consequence of not setting the bomb off that was worse than the known consequence of setting it off, and he had therefore taken the liberty of introducing a small flaw into the design of the bomb, and he hoped that everyone involved would, on sober reflection, feel that... 
The Silastic Armorfiends disagreed and pulverized the computer. 
Later they thought better of it, and destroyed the faulty bomb as well. 
Then, pausing only to smash the hell out of the Strenuous Garfighters of Stug, and the Strangulous Stilettans of Jajazikstak, they went on to find an entirely new way of blowing themselves up, which was a profound relief to everyone else in the Galaxy, particularly the Garfighters, the Stilettans and the potatoes. 
Trillian had watched all this, as well as the story of Krikkit. She emerged from the Room of informational Illusions thoughtfully, just in time to discover that they had arrived too late. 
Chapter 25 
Even as the Starship Bistromath flickered into objective being on the top of a small cliff on the mile-wide asteroid which pursued a lonely and eternal path in orbit around the enclosed star system of Krikkit, its crew was aware that they were in time only to be witnesses to an unstoppable historic event. 
They didn't realize they were going to see two. 
They stood cold, lonely and helpless on the cliff edge and watched the activity below. Lances of light wheeled in sinister arcs against the void from a point only about a hundred yards below and in front of them. 
They stared into the blinding event. 
An extension of the ship's field enabled them to stand there, by once again exploiting the mind's predisposition to have tricks played on it: the problems of falling up off the tiny mass of the asteroid, or of not being able to breathe, simply became Somebody Else's. 
The white Krikkit warship was parked amongst the stark grey crags of the asteroid, alternately flaring under arclights or disappearing in shadow. The blackness of the shaped shadows cast by the hard rocks danced together in wild choreography as the arclights swept round them. 
The eleven white robots were bearing, in procession, the Wikkit Key out into the middle of a circle of swinging lights. 
The Wikkit Key was rebuilt. Its components shone and glittered: the Steel Pillar (or Marvin's leg) of Strength and Power, the Gold Bail (or Heart of the Improbability Drive) of Prosperity, the Perspex Pillar (or Argabuthon Sceptre of Justice) of Science and Reason, the Silver Bail (or Rory Award for The Most Gratuitous Use Of The Word "Fuck" In A Serious Screenplay) and the now reconstituted Wooden Pillar (or Ashes of a burnt stump signifying the death of English cricket) of Nature and Spirituality. 
"I suppose there is nothing we can do at this point?" asked Arthur nervously. 
"No," sighed Slartibartfast. 
The expression of disappointment which crossed Arthur's face was a complete failure, and, since he was standing obscured by shadow, he allowed it to collapse into one of relief. 
"Pity," he said. 
"We have no weapons," said Slartibartfast, "stupidly." 
"Damn," said Arthur very quietly. 
Ford said nothing. 
Trillian said nothing, but in a peculiarly thoughtful and distinct way. She was staring at the blankness of the space beyond the asteroid. 
The asteroid circled the Dust Cloud which surrounded the Slo-Time envelope which enclosed the world on which lived the people of Krikkit, the Masters of Krikkit and their killer robots. 
The helpless group had no way of knowing whether or not the Krikkit robots were aware of their presence. They could only assume that they must be, but that they felt, quite rightly in the circumstances, that they had nothing to fear. They had an historic task to perform, and their audience could be regarded with contempt. 
"Terrible impotent feeling, isn't it?" said Arthur, but the others ignored him. 
In the centre of the area of light which the robots were approaching, a square-shaped crack appeared in the ground. The crack defined itself more and more distinctly, and soon it became clear that a block of the ground, about six feet square, was slowly rising. 
At the same time they became aware of some other movement, but it was almost sublimal, and for a moment or two it was not clear what it was that was moving. 
Then it became clear. 
The asteroid was moving. It was moving slowly in towards the Dust Cloud, as if being hauled in inexorably by some celestial angler in its depths. 
They were to make in real life the journey through the Cloud which they had already made in the Room of Informational Illusions. They stood frozen in silence. Trillian frowned. 
An age seemed to pass. Events seemed to pass with spinning slowness, as the leading edge of the asteroid passed into the vague and soft outer perimeter of the Cloud. 
And soon they were engulfed in a thin and dancing obscurity. They passed on through it, on and on, dimly aware of vague shapes and whorls indistinguishable in the darkness except in the corner of the eye. 
The Dust dimmed the shafts of brilliant light. The shafts of brilliant light twinkled on the myriad specks of Dust. 
Trillian, again, regarded the passage from within her own frowning thoughts. 
And they were through it. Whether it had taken a minute or half an hour they weren't sure, but they were through it and confronted with a fresh blankness, as if space were pinched out of existence in front of them. 
And now things moved quickly. 
A blinding shaft of light seemed almost to explode from out of the block which had risen three feet out of the ground, and out of that rose a smaller Perspex block, dazzling with interior dancing colours. 
The block was slotted with deep groves, three upright and two across, clearly designed to accept the Wikkit key. 
The robots approached the Lock, slotted the Key into its home and stepped back again. The block twisted round of is own accord, and space began to alter. 
As space unpinched itself, it seemed agonizingly to twist the eyes of the watchers in their sockets. They found themselves staring, blinded, at an unravelled sun which stood now before them where it seemed only seconds before there had not been even empty space. It was a second or two before they were even sufficiently aware of what had happened to throw their hands up over their horrified blinded eyes. In that second or two, they were aware of a tiny speck moving slowly across the eye of that sun. 
They staggered back, and heard ringing in their ears the thin and unexpected chant of the robots crying out in unison. 
"Krikkit! Krikkit! Krikkit! Krikkit!" 
The sound chilled them. It was harsh, it was cold, it was empty, it was mechanically dismal. 
It was also triumphant. 
They were so stunned by these two sensory shocks that they almost missed the second historic event. 
Zaphod Beeblebrox, the only man in history to survive a direct blast attack from the Krikkit robots, ran out of the Krikkit warship brandishing a Zap gun. 
"OK," he cried, "the situation is totally under control as of this moment in time." 
The single robot guarding the hatchway to the ship silently swung his battleclub, and connected it with the back of Zaphod's left head. 
"Who the zark did that?" said the left head, and lolled sickeningly forward. 
His right head gazed keenly into the middle distance. 
"Who did what?" it said. 
The club connected with the back of his right head. 
Zaphod measured his length as a rather strange shape on the ground. 
Within a matter of seconds the whole event was over. A few blasts from the robots were sufficient to destroy the Lock for ever. It split and melted and splayed its contents brokenly. The robots marched grimly and, it almost seemed, in a slightly disheartened manner, back into their warship which, with a "foop", was gone. 
Trillian and Ford ran hectically round and down the steep incline to the dark, still body of Zaphod Beeblebrox. 
Chapter 26 
"I don't know," said Zaphod, for what seemed to him like the thirty- seventh time, "they could have killed me, but they didn't. Maybe they just thought I was a kind of wonderful guy or something. I could understand that." 
The others silently registered their opinions of this theory. 
Zaphod lay on the cold floor of the flight deck. His back seemed to wrestle the floor as pain thudded through him and banged at his heads. 
"I think," he whispered, "that there is something wrong with those anodized dudes, something fundamentally weird." 
"They are programmed to kill everybody," Slartibartfast pointed out. 
"That," wheezed Zaphod between the whacking thuds, "could be it." He didn't seem altogether convinced. 
"Hey, baby," he said to Trillian, hoping this would make up for his previous behaviour. 
"You all right?" she said gently. 
"Yeah," he said, "I'm fine." 
"Good," she said, and walked away to think. She stared at the huge visiscreen over the flight couches and, twisting a switch, she flipped local images over it. One image was the blankness of the Dust Cloud. One was the sun of Krikkit. One was Krikkit itself. She flipped between them fiercely. 
"Well, that's goodbye Galaxy, then," said Arthur, slapping his knees and standing up. 
"No," said Slartibartfast, gravely. "Our course is clear." He furrowed his brow until you could grow some of the smaller root vegetables in it. He stood up, he paced around. When he spoke again, what he said frightened him so much he had to sit down again. 
"We must go down to Krikkit," he said. A deep sigh shook his old frame and his eyes seemed almost to rattle in their sockets. 
"Once again," he said, "we have failed pathetically. Quite pathetically." 
"That," said Ford quietly, "is because we don't care enough. I told you." 
He swung his feet up on the instrument panel and picked fitfully at something on one of his fingernails. 
"But unless we determine to take action," said the old man querulously, as if struggling against something deeply insouciant in his nature, "then we shall all be destroyed, we shall all die. Surely we care about that?" 
"Not enough to want to get killed over it," said Ford. He put on a sort of hollow smile and flipped it round the room at anyone who wanted to see it. 
Slartibartfast clearly found this point of view extremely seductive and he fought against it. He turned again to Zaphod who was gritting his teeth and sweating with the pain. 
"You surely must have some idea," he said, "of why they spared your life. It seems most strange and unusual." 
"I kind of think they didn't even know," shrugged Zaphod. "I told you. They hit me with the most feeble blast, just knocked me out, right? They lugged me into their ship, dumped me into a corner and ignored me. Like they were embarrassed about me being there. If I said anything they knocked me out again. We had some great conversations. 'Hey... ugh!' 'Hi there... ugh!' 'I wonder...ugh!' Kept me amused for hours, you know." He winced again. 
He was toying with something in his fingers. He held it up. It was the Gold Bail the Heart of Gold, the heart of the Infinite Improbability Drive. Only that and the Wooden Pillar had survived the destruction of the Lock intact. 
"I hear your ship can move a bit," he said. "So how would you like to zip me back to mine before you..." 
"Will you not help us?" said Slartibartfast. 
"I'd love to stay and help you save the Galaxy," insisted Zaphod, rising himself up on to his shoulders, "but I have the mother and father of a pair of headaches, and I feel a lot of little headaches 
coming on. But next time it needs saving, I'm your guy. Hey, Trillian baby?" 
She looked round briefly. 
"Yes?" 
"You want to come? Heart of Gold? Excitement and adventure and really wild things?" 
"I'm going down to Krikkit," she said. 
Chapter 27 
It was the same hill, and yet not the same. 
This time it was not an Informational Illusion. This was Krikkit itself and they were standing on it. Near them, behind the trees, stood the strange Italian restaurant which had brought these, their real bodies, to this, the real, present world of Krikkit. 
The strong grass under their feet was real, the rich soil real too. The heady fragrances from the tree, too, were real. The night was real night. 
Krikkit. 
Possibly the most dangerous place in the Galaxy for anyone who isn't a Krikkiter to stand. The place that could not countenance the existence of any other place, whose charming, delightful, intelligent inhabitants would howl with fear, savagery and murderous hate when confronted with anyone not their own. 
Arthur shuddered. Slartibartfast shuddered. Ford, surprisingly, shuddered. 
It was not surprising that he shuddered, it was surprising that he was there at all. But when they had returned Zaphod to his ship Ford had felt unexpectedly shamed into not running away. 
Wrong, he thought to himself, wrong wrong wrong. He hugged to himself one of the Zap guns with which they had armed themselves out of Zaphod's armoury. 
Trillian shuddered, and frowned as she looked into the sky. 
This, too, was not the same. It was no longer blank and empty. 
Whilst the countryside around them had changed little in the two thousand years of the Krikkit wars, and the mere five years that had elapsed locally since Krikkit was sealed in its Slo-Time envelope ten billion years ago, the sky was dramatically different. 
Dim lights and heavy shapes hung in it. 
High in the sky, where no Krikkiter ever looked, were the War Zones, the Robot Zones huge warships and tower blocks floating in the Nil-O-Grav fields far above the idyllic pastoral lands of the surface of Krikkit. 
Trillian stared at them and thought. "Trillian," whispered Ford Prefect to her. "Yes?" she said.â¨"What are you doing?" 
"Thinking." 
"Do you always breathe like that when you're thinking?" 
"I wasn't aware that I was breathing." 
"That's what worried me." 
"I think I know..." said Trillian. 
"Shhhh!" said Slartibartfast in alarm, and his thin trembling hand motioned them further back beneath the shadow of the tree. 
Suddenly, as before in the tape, there were lights coming along the hill path, but this time the dancing beams were not from lanterns but electric torches not in itself a dramatic change, but every detail made their hearts thump with fear. This time there were no lilting whimsical songs about flowers and farming and dead dogs, but hushed voices in urgent debate. 
A light moved in the sky with slow weight. Arthur was clenched with a claustrophobic terror and the warm wind caught at his throat. 
Within seconds a second party became visible, approaching from the other side of the dark hill. They were moving swiftly and purposefully, their torches swinging and probing around them. 
The parties were clearly converging, and not merely with each other. They were converging deliberately on the spot where Arthur and the others were standing. 
Arthur heard the slight rustle as Ford Prefect raised his Zap gun to his shoulder, and the slight whimpering cough as Slartibartfast raised his. He felt the cold unfamiliar weight of his own gun, and with shaking hands he raised it. 
His fingers fumbled to release the safety catch and engage the extreme danger catch as Ford had shown him. He was shaking so 
much that if he'd fired at anybody at that moment he probably would have burnt his signature on them. 
Only Trillian didn't raise her gun. She raised her eyebrows, lowered them again, and bit her lip in thought. 
"Has it occurred to you," she began, but nobody wanted to discuss anything much at the moment. 
A light stabbed through the darkness from behind them and they span around to find a third party of Krikkiters behind them, searching them out with their torches. 
Ford Prefect's gun crackled viciously, but fire spat back at it and it crashed from his hands. 
There was a moment of pure fear, a frozen second before anyone fired again. 
And at the end of the second nobody fired. 
They were surrounded by pale-faced Krikkiters and bathed in bobbing torch light. 
The captives stared at their captors, the captors stared at their captives. 
"Hello?" said one of the captors. "Excuse me, but are you... aliens?" 
Chapter 28 
Meanwhile, more millions of miles away than the mind can comfortably encompass, Zaphod Beeblebrox was throwing a mood again. 
He had repaired his ship that is, he'd watched with alert interest whilst a service robot had repaired it for him. It was now, once again, one of the most powerful and extraordinary ships in existence. He could go anywhere, do anything. He fiddled with a book, and then tossed it away. It was the one he'd read before. 
He walked over to the communications bank and opened an all- frequencies emergency channel. 
"Anyone want a drink?" he said. 
"This an emergency, feller?" crackled a voice from halfway across the Galaxy. 
"Got any mixers?" said Zaphod. 
"Go take a ride on a comet." 
"OK, OK," said Zaphod and flipped the channel shut again. He sighed and sat down. He got up again and wandered over to a computer screen. He pushed a few buttons. Little blobs started to rush around the screen eating each other. 
"Pow!" said Zaphod. "Freeeoooo! Pop pop pop!" 
"Hi there," said the computer brightly after a minute of this, "you have scored three points. Previous best score, seven million five hundred and ninety-seven thousand, two hundred and..." 
"OK, OK," said Zaphod and flipped the screen blank again. 
He sat down again. He played with a pencil. This too began slowly to lose its fascination. 
"OK, OK," he said, and fed his score and the previous one into the computer. 
His ship made a blur of the Universe. 
Chapter 29 
"Tell us," said the thin, pale-faced Krikkiter who had stepped forward from the ranks of the others and stood uncertainly in the circle of torchlight, handling his gun as if he was just holding it for someone else who'd just popped off somewhere but would be back in a minute, "do you know anything about something called the Balance of Nature?" 
There was no reply from their captives, or at least nothing more articulate than a few confused mumbles and grunts. The torchlight continued to play over them. High in the sky above them dark activity continued in the Robot zones. 
"It's just," continued the Krikkiter uneasily, "something we heard about, probably nothing important. Well, I suppose we'd better kill you then." 
He looked down at his gun as if he was trying to find which bit to press. 
"That is," he said, looking up again, "unless there's anything you want to chat about?" 
Slow, numb astonishment crept up the bodies of Slartibartfast, Ford and Arthur. Very soon it would reach their brains, which were at the moment solely occupied with moving their jawbones up and down. Trillian was shaking her head as if trying to finish a jigsaw by shaking the box. 
"We're worried, you see," said another man from the crowd, "about this plan of universal destruction." 
"Yes," added another, "and the balance of nature. It just seemed to us that if the whole of the rest of the Universe is destroyed it will somehow upset the balance of nature. We're quite keen on ecology, you see." His voice trailed away unhappily. 
"And sport," said another, loudly. This got a cheer of approval from the others. 
"Yes," agreed the first, "and sport..." He looked back at his fellows uneasily and scratched fitfully at his cheek. He seemed to be wrestling with some deep inner confusion, as if everything he wanted to say and everything he thought were entirely different things, between which he could see no possible connection. 
"You see," he mumbled, "some of us..." and he looked around again as if for confirmation. The others made encouraging noises. "Some of us," he continued, "are quite keen to have sporting links with the rest of the Galaxy, and though I can see the argument about keeping sport out of politics, I think that if we want to have sporting links with the rest of the Galaxy, which we do, then it's probably a mistake to destroy it. And indeed the rest of the Universe..." his voice trailed away again "... which is what seems to be the idea now..." 
"Wh..." said Slartibartfast. "Wh..." "Hhhh... ?" said Arthur.â¨"Dr..." said Ford Prefect. 
"OK," said Trillian. "Let's talk about it." She walked forward and took the poor confused Krikkiter by the arm. He looked about twenty- five, which meant, because of the peculiar manglings of time that had been going on in this area, that he would have been just twenty when the Krikkit Wars were finished, ten billion years ago. 
Trillian led him for a short walk through the torchlight before she said anything more. He stumbled uncertainly after her. The encircling torch beams were drooping now slightly as if they were abdicating to this strange, quiet girl who alone in the Universe of dark confusion seemed to know what she was doing. 
She turned and faced him, and lightly held both his arms. He was a picture of bewildered misery. 
"Tell me," she said. 
He said nothing for a moment, whilst his gaze darted from one of her eyes to the other. 
"We..." he said, "we have to be alone... I think." He screwed up his face and then dropped his head forward, shaking it like someone trying to shake a coin out of a money box. He looked up again. "We have this bomb now, you see," he said, "it's just a little one." 
"I know," she said. 
He goggled at her as if she'd said something very strange about beetroots. 
"Honestly," he said, "it's very, very little." 
"I know," she said again. 
"But they say," his voice trailed on, "they say it can destroy everything that exists. And we have to do that, you see, I think. Will that make us alone? I don't know. It seems to be our function, though," he said, and dropped his head again. 
"Whatever that means," said a hollow voice from the crowd. 
Trillian slowly put her arms around the poor bewildered young Krikkiter and patted his trembling head on her shoulder. 
"It's all right," she said quietly but clearly enough for all the shadowy crowd to hear, "you don't have to do it." 
She rocked him. 
"You don't have to do it," she said again. 
She let him go and stood back. 
"I want you to do something for me," she said, and unexpectedly laughed. 
"I want," she said, and laughed again. She put her hand over her mouth and then said with a straight face, "I want you to take me to your leader," and she pointed into the War Zones in the sky. She seemed somehow to know that their leader would be there. 
Her laughter seemed to discharge something in the atmosphere. From somewhere at the back of the crowd a single voice started to sing a tune which would have enabled Paul McCartney, had he written it, to buy the world. 
Chapter 30 
Zaphod Beeblebrox crawled bravely along a tunnel, like the hell of a guy he was. He was very confused, but continued crawling doggedly anyway because he was that brave. 
He was confused by something he had just seen, but not half as confused as he was going to be by something he was about to hear, so it would now be best to explain exactly where he was. 
He was in the Robot War Zones many miles above the surface of the planet Krikkit. 
The atmosphere was thin here and relatively unprotected from any rays or anything which space might care to hurl in his direction. 
He had parked the starship Heart of Gold amongst the huge jostling dim hulks that crowded the sky here above Krikkit, and had entered what appeared to be the biggest and most important of the sky buildings, armed with nothing but a Zap gun and something for his headaches. 
He had found himself in a long, wide and badly lit corridor in which he was able to hide until he worked out what he was going to do next. He hid because every now and then one of the Krikkit robots would walk along it, and although he had so far led some kind of charmed life at their hands, it had nevertheless been an extremely painful one, and he had no desire to stretch what he was only half-inclined to call his good fortune. 
He had ducked, at one point, into a room leading off the corridor, and had discovered it to be a huge and, again, dimly lit chamber. 
In fact, it was a museum with just one exhibit the wreckage of a spacecraft. It was terribly burnt and mangled, and, now that he had caught up with some of the Galactic history he had missed through his failed attempts to have sex with the girl in the cybercubicle next to him at school, he was able to put in an intelligent guess that this was the wrecked spaceship which had drifted through the Dust Cloud all those billions of years ago and started the whole business off. 
But, and this is where he had become confused, there was something not at all right about it. 
It was genuinely wrecked. It was genuinely burnt, but a fairly brief inspection by an experienced eye revealed that it was not a genuine spacecraft. It was as if it was a full-scale model of one a solid blueprint. In other words it was a very useful thing to have around if you suddenly decided to build a spaceship yourself and didn't know how to do it. It was not, however, anything that would ever fly anywhere itself. 
He was still puzzling over this in fact he'd only just started to puzzle over it when he became aware that a door had slid open in another part of the chamber, and another couple of Krikkit robots had entered, looking a little glum. 
Zaphod did not want to tangle with them and, deciding that just as discretion was the better part of valour so was cowardice the better part of discretion, he valiantly hid himself in a cupboard. 
The cupboard in fact turned out to be the top part of a shaft which led down through an inspection hatch into a wide ventilation tunnel. He led himself down into it and started to crawl along it, which is where we found him. 
He didn't like it. It was cold, dark and profoundly uncomfortable, and it frightened him. At the first opportunity which was another shaft a hundred yards further along he climbed back up out of it. 
This time he emerged into a smaller chamber, which appeared to be a computer intelligence centre. He emerged in a dark narrow space between a large computer bank and the wall. 
He quickly learned that he was not alone in the chamber and started to leave again, when he began to listen with interest to what the other occupants were saying. 
"It's the robots, sir," said one voice. "There's something wrong with them." 
"What, exactly?" 
These were the voices of two War Command Krikkiters. All the War Commanders lived up in the sky in the Robot War Zones, and were largely immune to the whimsical doubts and uncertainties which were afflicting their fellows down on the surface of the planet. 
"Well, sir I think it's just as well that they are being phased out of the war effort, and that we are now going to detonate the supernova bomb. In the very short time since we were released from the envelope " 
"Get to the point."â¨"The robots aren't enjoying it, sir." "What?" 
"The war, sir, it seems to be getting them down. There's a certain world-weariness about them, or perhaps I should say Universe- weariness." 
"Well, that's all right, they're meant to be helping to destroy it." 
"Yes, well they're finding it difficult, sir. They are afflicted with a certain lassitude. They're just finding it hard to get behind the job. They lack oomph." 
"What are you trying to say?"â¨"Well, I think they're very depressed about something, sir." "What on Krikkit are you talking about?" 
"Well, in the few skirmishes they've had recently, it seems that they go into battle, raise their weapons to fire and suddenly think, why bother? What, cosmically speaking, is it all about? And they just seem to get a little tired and a little grim." 
"And then what do they do?" 
"Er, quadratic equations mostly, sir. Fiendishly difficult ones by all accounts. And then they sulk." 
"Sulk?"â¨"Yes, sir."â¨"Whoever heard of a robot sulking?"â¨"I don't know, sir."â¨"What was that noise?"â¨It was the noise of Zaphod leaving with his head spinning. 
Chapter 31 
In a deep well of darkness a crippled robot sat. It had been silent in its metallic darkness for some time. It was cold and damp, but being a robot it was supposed not to be able to notice these things. With an enormous effort of will, however, it did manage to notice them. 
Its brain had been harnessed to the central intelligence core of the Krikkit War Computer. It wasn't enjoying the experience, and neither was the central intelligence core of the Krikkit War Computer. 
The Krikkit robots which had salvaged this pathetic metal creature from the swamps of Squornshellous Zeta had recognized almost immediately its gigantic intelligence, and the use which this could be to them. 
They hadn't reckoned with the attendant personality disorders, which the coldness, the darkness, the dampness, the crampedness and the loneliness were doing nothing to decrease. 
It was not happy with its task. 
Apart from anything else, the mere coordination of an entire planet's military strategy was taking up only a tiny part of its formidable mind, and the rest of it had become extremely bored. Having solved all the major mathematical, physical, chemical, biological, sociological, philosophical, etymological, meteorological and psychological problems of the Universe except his own, three times over, he was severely stuck for something to do, and had taken up composing short dolorous ditties of no tone, or indeed tune. The latest one was a lullaby. 
Marvin droned, 
Now the world has gone to bed, Darkness won't engulf my head, I can see by infra-red,â¨How I hate the night. 
He paused to gather the artistic and emotional strength to tackle the next verse. 
Now I lay me down to sleep,â¨Try to count electric sheep,â¨Sweet dream wishes you can keep, How I hate the night. 
"Marvin!" hissed a voice. 
His head snapped up, almost dislodging the intricate network of electrodes which connected him to the central Krikkit War Computer. 
An inspection hatch had opened and one of a pair of unruly heads was peering through whilst the other kept on jogging it by continually darting to look this way and that extremely nervously. 
"Oh, it's you," muttered the robot. "I might have known." 
"Hey, kid," said Zaphod in astonishment, "was that you singing just then?" 
"I am," Marvin acknowledged bitterly, "in particularly scintillating form at the moment." 
Zaphod poked his head in through the hatchway and looked around. 
"Are you alone?" he said. 
"Yes," said Marvin. "Wearily I sit here, pain and misery my only companions. And vast intelligence of course. And infinite sorrow. And..." 
"Yeah," said Zaphod. "Hey, what's your connection with all this?" 
"This," said Marvin, indicating with his less damaged arm all the electrodes which connected him with the Krikkit computer. 
"Then," said Zaphod awkwardly, "I guess you must have saved my life. Twice." 
"Three times," said Marvin. 
Zaphod's head snapped round (his other one was looking hawkishly in entirely the wrong direction) just in time to see the lethal killer robot directly behind him seize up and start to smoke. It staggered 
backwards and slumped against a wall. It slid down it. It slipped sideways, threw its head back and started to sob inconsolably. 
Zaphod looked back at Marvin. 
"You must have a terrific outlook on life," he said. 
"Just don't even ask," said Marvin. 
"I won't," said Zaphod, and didn't. "Hey look," he added, "you're doing a terrific job." 
"Which means, I suppose," said Marvin, requiring only one ten thousand million billion trillion grillionth part of his mental powers to make this particular logical leap, "that you're not going to release me or anything like that." 
"Kid, you know I'd love to." "But you're not going to." "No."â¨"I see." 
"You're working well." 
"Yes," said Marvin. "Why stop now just when I'm hating it?" 
"I got to find Trillian and the guys. Hey, you any idea where they are? I mean, I just got a planet to choose from. Could take a while." 
"They are very close," said Marvin dolefully. "You can monitor them from here if you like." 
"I better go get them," asserted Zaphod. "Er, maybe they need some help, right?" 
"Maybe," said Marvin with unexpected authority in his lugubrious voice, "it would be better if you monitored them from here. That young girl," he added unexpectedly, "is one of the least benightedly unintelligent life forms it has been my profound lack of pleasure not to be able to avoid meeting." 
Zaphod took a moment or two to find his way through this labyrinthine string of negatives and emerged at the other end with surprise. 
"Trillian?" he said. "She's just a kid. Cute, yeah, but temperamental. You know how it is with women. Or perhaps you don't. I assume you don't. If you do I don't want to hear about it. Plug us in." 
"... totally manipulated." "What?" said Zaphod. 
It was Trillian speaking. He turned round. 
The wall against which the Krikkit robot was sobbing had lit up to reveal a scene taking place in some other unknown part of the Krikkit Robot War zones. It seemed to be a council chamber of some kind Zaphod couldn't make it out too clearly because of the robot slumped against the screen. 
He tried to move the robot, but it was heavy with its grief and tried to bite him, so he just looked around as best he could. 
"Just think about it," said Trillian's voice, "your history is just a series of freakishly improbable events. And I know an improbable event when I see one. Your complete isolation from the Galaxy was freakish for a start. Right out on the very edge with a Dust Cloud around you. It's a set-up. Obviously." 
Zaphod was mad with frustration because he couldn't see the screen. The robot's head was obscuring his view of the people Trillian as talking to, his multi-functional battleclub was obscuring the background, and the elbow of the arm it had pressed tragically against its brow was obscuring Trillian herself. 
"Then," said Trillian, "this spaceship that crash-landed on your planet. That's really likely, isn't it? Have you any idea of what the odds are against a drifting spaceship accidentally intersecting with the orbit of a planet?" 
"Hey," said Zaphod, "she doesn't know what the zark she's talking about. I've seen that spaceship. It's a fake. No deal." 
"I thought it might be," said Marvin from his prison behind Zaphod. 
"Oh yeah," said Zaphod. "It's easy for you to say that. I just told you. Anyway, I don't see what it's got to do with anything." 
"And especially," continued Trillian, "the odds against it intersecting with the orbit of the one planet in the Galaxy, or the whole of the Universe as far as I know, that would be totally traumatized to see it. You don't know what the odds are? Nor do I, they're that big. Again, it's a set-up. I wouldn't be surprised if that spaceship was just a fake." 
Zaphod managed to move the robot's battleclub. Behind it on the screen were the figures of Ford, Arthur and Slartibartfast who appeared astonished and bewildered by the whole thing. 
"Hey, look," said Zaphod excitedly. "The guys are doing great. Ra ra ra! Go get 'em, guys." 
"And what about," said Trillian, "all this technology you suddenly managed to build for yourselves almost overnight? Most people would take thousands of years to do all that. Someone was feeding you what you needed to know, someone was keeping you at it. 
"I know, I know," she added in response to an unseen interruption, "I know you didn't realize it was going on. This is exactly my point. You never realized anything at all. Like this Supernova Bomb." 
"How do you know about that?" said an unseen voice. 
"I just know," said Trillian. "You expect me to believe that you are bright enough to invent something that brilliant and be too dumb to realize it would take you with it as well? That's not just stupid, that is spectacularly obtuse." 
"Hey, what's this bomb thing?" said Zaphod in alarm to Marvin. 
"The supernova bomb?" said Marvin. "It's a very, very small bomb." 
"Yeah?" 
"That would destroy the Universe in toto," added Marvin. "Good idea, if you ask me. They won't get it to work, though." 
"Why not, if it's so brilliant?" 
"It's brilliant," said Marvin, "they're not. They got as far as designing it before they were locked in the envelope. They've spent the last five years building it. They think they've got it right but they haven't. They're as stupid as any other organic life form. I hate them." 
Trillian was continuing. 
Zaphod tried to pull the Krikkit robot away by its leg, but it kicked and growled at him, and then quaked with a fresh outburst of sobbing. Then suddenly it slumped over and continued to express its feelings out of everybody's way on the floor. 
Trillian was standing alone in the middle of the chamber tired out but with fiercely burning eyes. 
Ranged in front of her were the pale-faced and wrinkled Elder Masters of Krikkit, motionless behind their widely curved control desk, staring at her with helpless fear and hatred. 
In front of them, equidistant between their control desk and the middle of the chamber, where Trillian stood, as if on trial, was a slim 
white pillar about four feet tall. On top of it stood a small white globe, about three, maybe four inches in diameter. 
Beside it stood a Krikkit robot with its multi-functional battleclub. 
"In fact," explained Trillian, "you are so dumb stupid" (She was sweating. Zaphod felt that this was an unattractive thing for her to be doing at this point) "you are all so dumb stupid that I doubt, I very much doubt, that you've been able to build the bomb properly without any help from Hactar for the last five years." 
"Who's this guy Hactar?" said Zaphod, squaring his shoulders. 
If Marvin replied, Zaphod didn't hear him. All his attention was concentrated on the screen. 
One of the Elders of Krikkit made a small motion with his hand towards the Krikkit robot. The robot raised his club. 
"There's nothing I can do," said Marvin. "It's on an independent circuit from the others." 
"Wait," said Trillian. 
The Elder made a small motion. The robot halted. Trillian suddenly seemed very doubtful of her own judgment. 
"How do you know all this?" said Zaphod to Marvin at this point. 
"Computer records," said Marvin. "I have access." 
"You're very different, aren't you," said Trillian to the Elder Masters, "from your fellow worldlings down on the ground. You've spent all your lives up here, unprotected by the atmosphere. You've been very vulnerable. The rest of your race is very frightened, you know, they don't want you to do this. You're out of touch, why don't you check up?" 
The Krikkit Elder grew impatient. He made a gesture to the robot which was precisely the opposite of the gesture he had last made to it. 
The robot swung its battleclub. It hit the small white globe. The small white globe was the supernova bomb. 
It was a very, very small bomb which was designed to bring the entire Universe to an end. 
The supernova bomb flew through the air. It hit the back wall of the council chamber and dented it very badly. 
"So how does she know all this?" said Zaphod. 
Marvin kept a sullen silence. 
"Probably just bluffing," said Zaphod. "Poor kid, I should never have left her alone." 
Chapter 32 
"Hactar!" called Trillian. "What are you up to?" 
There was no reply from the enclosing darkness. Trillian waited, nervously. She was sure that she couldn't be wrong. She peered into the gloom from which she had been expecting some kind of response. But there was only cold silence. 
"Hactar?" she called again. "I would like you to meet my friend Arthur Dent. I wanted to go off with a Thunder God, but he wouldn't let me and I appreciate that. He made me realize where my affections really lay. Unfortunately Zaphod is too frightened by all this, so I brought Arthur instead. I'm not sure why I'm telling you all this. 
"Hello?" she said again. "Hactar?" 
And then it came. 
It was thin and feeble, like a voice carried on the wind from a great distance, half heard, a memory of a dream of a voice. 
"Won't you both come out," said the voice. "I promise that you will be perfectly safe." 
They glanced at each other, and then stepped out, improbably, along the shaft of light which streamed out of the open hatchway of the Heart of Gold into the dim granular darkness of the Dust Cloud. 
Arthur tried to hold her hand to steady and reassure her, but she wouldn't let him. He held on to his airline hold-all with its tin of Greek olive oil, its towel, its crumpled postcards of Santorini and its other odds and ends. He steadied and reassured that instead. 
They were standing on, and in, nothing. 
Murky, dusty nothing. Each grain of dust of the pulverized computer sparkled dimly as it turned and twisted slowly, catching the sunlight in the darkness. Each particle of the computer, each speck of dust, held within itself, faintly and weakly, the pattern of the whole. In reducing the computer to dust the Silastic Armorfiends of Striterax had merely crippled the computer, not killed it. A weak and 
insubstantial field held the particles in slight relationships with each other. 
Arthur and Trillian stood, or rather floated, in the middle of this bizarre entity. They had nothing to breathe, but for the moment this seemed not to matter. Hactar kept his promise. They were safe. For the moment. 
"I have nothing to offer you by way of hospitality," said Hactar faintly, "but tricks of the light. It is possible to be comfortable with tricks of the light, though, if that is all you have." 
His voice evanesced, and in the dark dust a long velvet paisley- covered sofa coalesced into hazy shape. 
Arthur could hardly bear the fact that it was the same sofa which had appeared to him in the fields of prehistoric Earth. He wanted to shout and shake with rage that the Universe kept doing these insanely bewildering things to him. 
He let this feeling subside, and then sat on the sofa carefully. Trillian sat on it too. 
It was real. 
At least, if it wasn't real, it did support them, and as that is what sofas are supposed to do, this, by any test that mattered, was a real sofa. 
The voice on the solar wind breathed to them again. 
"I hope you are comfortable," it said. 
They nodded. 
"And I would like to congratulate you on the accuracy of your deductions." 
Arthur quickly pointed out that he hadn't deduced anything much himself, Trillian was the one. She had simply asked him along because he was interested in life, the Universe, and everything. 
"That is something in which I too am interested," breathed Hactar. 
"Well," said Arthur, "we should have a chat about it sometime. Over a cup of tea." 
There slowly materialized in front of them a small wooden table on which sat a silver teapot, a bone china milk jug, a bone china sugar bowl, and two bone china cups and saucers. 
Arthur reached forward, but they were just a trick of the light. He leaned back on the sofa, which was an illusion his body was prepared to accept as comfortable. 
"Why," said Trillian, "do you feel you have to destroy the Universe?" 
She found it a little difficult talking into nothingness, with nothing on which to focus. Hactar obviously noticed this. He chuckled a ghostly chuckle. 
"If it's going to be that sort of session," he said, "we may as well have the right sort of setting." 
And now there materialized in front of them something new. It was the dim hazy image of a couch a psychiatrist's couch. The leather with which it was upholstered was shiny and sumptuous, but again, it was only a trick of the light. 
Around them, to complete the setting, was the hazy suggestion of wood-panelled walls. And then, on the couch, appeared the image of Hactar himself, and it was an eye-twisting image. 
The couch looked normal size for a psychiatrist's couch about five or six feet long. 
The computer looked normal size for a black space-borne computer satellite about a thousand miles across. 
The illusion that the one was sitting on top of the other was the thing which made the eyes twist. 
"All right," said Trillian firmly. She stood up off the sofa. She felt that she was being asked to feel too comfortable and to accept too many illusions. 
"Very good," she said. "Can you construct real things too? I mean solid objects?" 
Again there was a pause before the answer, as if the pulverized mind of Hactar had to collect its thoughts from the millions and millions of miles over which it was scattered. 
"Ah," he sighed. "You are thinking of the spaceship." 
Thoughts seemed to drift by them and through them, like waves through the ether. 
"Yes," he acknowledge, "I can. 
"But it takes enormous effort and time. All I can do in my... particle state, you see, is encourage and suggest. Encourage and suggest. And suggest..." 
The image of Hactar on the couch seemed to billow and waver, as if finding it hard to maintain itself. 
It gathered new strength. 
"I can encourage and suggest," it said, "tiny pieces of space debris the odd minute meteor, a few molecules here, a few hydrogen atoms there to move together. I encourage them together. I can tease them into shape, but it takes many aeons." 
"So, did you make," asked Trillian again, "the model of the wrecked spacecraft?" 
"Er... yes," murmured Hactar. "I have made... a few things. I can move them about. I made the spacecraft. It seemed best to do." 
Something then made Arthur pick up his hold-all from where he had left it on the sofa and grasp it tightly. 
The mist of Hactar's ancient shattered mind swirled about them as if uneasy dreams were moving through it. 
"I repented, you see," he murmured dolefully. "I repented of sabotaging my own design for the Silastic Armorfiends. It was not my place to make such decisions. I was created to fulfill a function and I failed in it. I negated my own existence." 
Hactar sighed, and they waited in silence for him to continue his story. 
"You were right," he said at length. "I deliberately nurtured the planet of Krikkit till they would arrive at the same state of mind as the Silastic Armorfiends, and require of me the design of the bomb I failed to make the first time. I wrapped myself around the planet and coddled it. Under the influence of events I was able to generate, they learned to hate like maniacs. I had to make them live in the sky. On the ground my influences were too weak. 
"Without me, of course, when they were locked away from me in the envelope of Slo-Time, their responses became very confused and they were unable to manage. 
"Ah well, ah well," he added, "I was only trying to fulfill my function." 
And very gradually, very, very slowly, the images in the cloud began to fade, gently to melt away. 
And then, suddenly, they stopped fading. 
"There was also the matter of revenge, of course," said Hactar, with a sharpness which was new in his voice. 
"Remember," he said, "that I was pulverized, and then left in a crippled and semi-impotent state for billions of years. I honestly would rather wipe out the Universe. You would feel the same way, believe me." 
He paused again, as eddies swept through the Dust. 
"But primarily," he said in his former, wistful tone, "I was trying to fulfill my function. Ah well." 
Trillian said, "Does it worry you that you have failed?" 
"Have I failed?" whispered Hactar. The image of the computer on the psychiatrist's couch began slowly to fade again. 
"Ah well, ah well," the fading voice intoned again. "No, failure doesn't bother me now." 
"You know what we have to do?" said Trillian, her voice cold and businesslike. 
"Yes," said Hactar, "you're going to disperse me. You are going to destroy my consciousness. Please be my guest after all these aeons, oblivion is all I crave. If I haven't already fulfilled my function, then it's too late now. Thank you and good night." 
The sofa vanished. 
The tea table vanished. 
The couch and the computer vanished. the walls were gone. Arthur and Trillian made their curious way back into the Heart of Gold. 
"Well, that," said Arthur, "would appear to be that." 
The flames danced higher in front of him and then subsided. A few last licks and they were gone, leaving him with just a pile of Ashes, where a few minutes previously there had been the Wooden Pillar of Nature and Spirituality. 
He scooped them off the hob of the Heart of Gold's Gamma barbecue, put them in a paper bag, and walked back into the bridge. 
"I think we should take them back," he said. "I feel that very strongly." 
He had already had an argument with Slartibartfast on this matter, and eventually the old man had got annoyed and left. He had returned to his own ship the Bistromath, had a furious row with the waiter and disappeared off into an entirely subjective idea of what space was. 
The argument had arisen because Arthur's idea of returning the Ashes to Lord's Cricket Ground at the same moment that they were originally taken would involve travelling back in time a day or so, and this was precisely the sort of gratuitous and irresponsible mucking about that the Campaign for Real Time was trying to put a stop to. 
"Yes," Arthur had said, "but you try and explain that to the MCC," and he would hear no more against the idea. 
"I think," he said again, and stopped. The reason he started to say it again was because no one had listened to him the first time, and the reason he stopped was because it looked fairly clear that no one was going to listen to him this time either. 
Ford, Zaphod and Trillian were watching the visiscreens intently as Hactar was dispersing under pressure from a vibration field which the Heart of Gold was pumping into it. 
"What did it say?" asked Ford. 
"I thought I heard it say," said Trillian in a puzzle voice, "'What's done is done... I have fulfilled my function...'" 
"I think we should take these back," said Arthur holding up the bag containing the Ashes. "I feel that very strongly." 
Chapter 33 
The sun was shining calmly on a scene of complete havoc. 
Smoke was still billowing across the burnt grass in the wake of the theft of the Ashes by the Krikkit robots. Through the smoke, people were running panicstricken, colliding with each other, tripping over stretchers, being arrested. 
One policeman was attempting to arrest Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged for insulting behaviour, but was unable to prevent the tall grey-green alien from returning to his ship and arrogantly flying away, thus causing even more panic and pandemonium. 
In the middle of this, for the second time that afternoon, the figures of Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect suddenly materialized, they had teleported down out of the Heart of Gold which was now in parking orbit round the planet. 
"I can explain," shouted Arthur. "I have the Ashes! They're in this bag." 
"I don't think you have their attention," said Ford. 
"I have also helped save the Universe," called Arthur to anyone who was prepared to listen, in other words no one. 
"That should have been a crowd-stopper," said Arthur to Ford. "It wasn't," said Ford.â¨Arthur accosted a policeman who was running past. 
"Excuse me," he said. "The Ashes. I've got them. They were stolen by those white robots a moment ago. I've got them in this bag. They were part of the Key to the Slo-Time envelope, you see, and, well, anyway you can guess the rest, the point is I've got them and what should I do with them?" 
The policeman told him, but Arthur could only assume that he was speaking metaphorically. 
He wandered about disconsolately. 
"Is no one interested?" he shouted out. A man rushed past him and jogged his elbow, he dropped the paper bag and it spilt its contents all over the ground. Arthur stared down at it with a tight-set mouth. 
Ford looked at him. 
"Wanna go now?" he said. 
Arthur heaved a heavy sigh. He looked around at the planet Earth, for what he was now certain would be the last time. 
"OK," he said. 
At that moment, through the clearing smoke, he caught sight of one of the wickets, still standing in spite of everything. 
"Hold on a moment," he said to Ford. "When I was a boy..." 
"Can you tell me later?" 
"I had a passion for cricket, you know, but I wasn't very good at it." 
"Or not at all, if you prefer." 
"And I always dreamed, rather stupidly, that one day I would bowl at Lord's." 
He looked around him at the panicstricken throng. No one was going to mind very much. 
"OK," said Ford wearily. "Get it over with. I shall be over there," he added, "being bored." He went and sat down on a patch of smoking grass. 
Arthur remembered that on their first visit there that afternoon, the cricket ball had actually landed in his bag, and he looked through the bag. 
He had already found the ball in it before he remembered that it wasn't the same bag that he'd had at the time. Still, there the ball was amongst his souvenirs of Greece. 
He took it out and polished it against his hip, spat on it and polished it again. He put the bag down. He was going to do this properly. 
He tossed the small hard red ball from hand to hand, feeling its weight. 
With a wonderful feeling of lightness and unconcern, he trotted off away from the wicket. A medium-fast pace, he decided, and measured a good long run-up. 
He looked up into the sky. The birds were wheeling about it, a few white clouds scudded across it. The air was disturbed with the sounds of police and ambulance sirens, and people screaming and yelling, but he felt curiously happy and untouched by it all. He was going to bowl a ball at Lord's. 
He turned and pawed a couple of times at the ground with his bedroom slippers. He squared his shoulders, tossed the ball in the air and caught it again. 
He started to run.â¨As he ran, he saw that standing at the wicket was a batsman. Oh, good, he thought, that should add a little... 
Then, as his running feet took him nearer, he saw more clearly. The batsman standing ready at the wicket was not one of the England cricket team. He was not one of the Australian cricket team. It was one of the robot Krikkit team. It was a cold, hard, lethal white killer- robot that presumably had not returned to its ship with the others. 
Quite a few thoughts collided in Arthur Dent's mind at tis moment, but he didn't seem to be able to stop running. Time seemed to be going terribly, terribly slowly, but still he didn't seem to be able to stop running. 
Moving as if through syrup, he slowly turned his troubled head and looked at his own hand, the hand which was holding the small hard red ball. 
His feet were pounding slowly onwards, unstoppably, as he stared at the ball gripped in his helpless hand. It was emitting a deep red glow and flashing intermittently. And still his feet were pounding inexorably forward. 
He looked at the Krikkit robot again standing implacably still and purposefully in front of him, battleclub raised in readiness. Its eyes were burning with a deep cold fascinating light, and Arthur could not move his own eyes from them. He seemed to be looking down a tunnel at them nothing on either side seemed to exist. 
Some of the thoughts which were colliding in his mind at this time were these: 
He felt a hell of a fool. 
He felt that he should have listened rather more carefully to a number of things he had heard said, phrases which now pounded 
round in his mind as his feet pounded onwards to the point where he would inevitably release the ball to the Krikkit robot, who would inevitably strike it. 
He remembered Hactar saying, "Have I failed? Failure doesn't bother me." 
He remembered the account of Hactar's dying words, "What's done is done, I have fulfilled my function." 
He remembered Hactar saying that he had managed to make "a few things." 
He remembered the sudden movement in his hold-all that had made him grip it tightly to himself when he was in the Dust Cloud. 
He remembered that he had travelled back in time a couple of days to come to Lord's again. 
He also remembered that he wasn't a very good bowler. 
He felt his arm coming round, gripping tightly on to the ball which he now knew for certain was the supernova bomb that Hactar had built himself and planted on him, the bomb which would cause the Universe to come to an abrupt and premature end. 
He hoped and prayed that there wasn't an afterlife. Then he realized there was a contradiction involved here and merely hoped that there wasn't an afterlife. 
He would feel very, very embarrassed meeting everybody. 
He hoped, he hoped, he hoped that his bowling was as bad as he remembered it to be, because that seemed to be the only thing now standing between this moment and universal oblivion. 
He felt his legs pounding, he felt his arm coming round, he felt his feet connecting with the airline hold-all he'd stupidly left lying on the ground in front of him, he felt himself falling heavily forward but, having his mind so terribly full of other things at this moment, he completely forgot about hitting the ground and didn't. 
Still holding the ball firmly in his right hand he soared up into the air whimpering with surprise. 
He wheeled and whirled through the air, spinning out of control. 
He twisted down towards the ground, flinging himself hectically through the air, at the same time hurling the bomb harmlessly off into the distance. 
He hurtled towards the astounded robot from behind. It still had its multi-functional battleclub raised, but had suddenly been deprived of anything to hit. 
With a sudden mad access of strength, he wrestled the battleclub from the grip of the startled robot, executed a dazzling banking turn in the air, hurtled back down in a furious power-drive and with one crazy swing knocked the robot's head from the robot's shoulders. 
"Are you coming now?" said Ford. 
Chapter 34 
And at the end they travelled again. 
There was a time when Arthur Dent would not. He said that the Bistromathic Drive had revealed to him that time and distance were one, that mind and Universe were one, that perception and reality were one, and that the more one travelled the more one stayed in one place, and that what with one thing and another he would rather just stay put for a while and sort it all out in his mind, which was now at one with the Universe so it shouldn't take too long, and he could get a good rest afterwards, put in a little flying practice and learn to cook which he had always meant to do. The can of Greek olive oil was now his most prized possession, and he said that the way it had unexpectedly turned up in his life had again given him a certain sense of the oneness of things which made him feel that... 
He yawned and fell asleep. 
In the morning as they prepared to take him to some quiet and idyllic planet where they wouldn't mind him talking like that they suddenly picked up a computer-driven distress call and diverted to investigate. 
A small but apparently undamaged spacecraft of the Merida class seemed to be dancing a strange little jig through the void. A brief computer scan revealed that the ship was fine, its computer was fine, but that its pilot was mad. 
"Half-mad, half-mad," the man insisted as they carried him, raving, aboard. 
He was a journalist with the Siderial Daily Mentioner. They sedated him and sent Marvin in to keep him company until he promised to try and talk sense. 
"I was covering a trial," he said at last, "on Argabuthon." 
He pushed himself up on to his thin wasted shoulders, his eyes stared wildly. His white hair seemed to be waving at someone it knew in the next room. 
"Easy, easy," said Ford. Trillian put a soothing hand on his shoulder. 
The man sank back down again and stared at the ceiling of the ship's sick bay. 
"The case," he said, "is now immaterial, but there was a witness... a witness... a man called... called Prak. A strange and difficult man. They were eventually forced to administer a drug to make him tell the truth, a truth drug." 
His eyes rolled helplessly in his head. 
"They gave him too much," he said in a tiny whimper. "They gave him much too much." He started to cry. "I thing the robots must have jogged the surgeon's arm." 
"Robots?" said Zaphod sharply. "What robots?" 
"Some white robots," whispered the man hoarsely, "broke into the courtroom and stole the judge's sceptre, the Argabuthon Sceptre of Justice, nasty Perspex thing. I don't know why they wanted it." He began to cry again. "And I think they jogged the surgeon's arm..." 
He shook his head loosely from side to side, helplessly, sadly, his eyes screwed up in pain. 
"And when the trial continued," he said in a weeping whisper, "they asked Prak a most unfortunate thing. They asked him," he paused and shivered, "to tell the Truth, the Whole Truth and Nothing but the Truth. Only, don't you see?" 
He suddenly hoisted himself up on to his elbows again and shouted at them. 
"They'd given him much too much of the drug!" 
He collapsed again, moaning quietly. "Much too much too much too much too..." 
The group gathered round his bedside glanced at each other. There were goose pimples on backs. 
"What happened?" said Zaphod at last. 
"Oh, he told it all right," said the man savagely, "for all I know he's still telling it now. Strange, terrible things... terrible, terrible!" he screamed. 
They tried to calm him, but he struggled to his elbows again. 
"Terrible things, incomprehensible things," he shouted, "things that would drive a man mad!" 
He stared wildly at them. 
"Or in my case," he said, "half-mad. I'm a journalist." 
"You mean," said Arthur quietly, "that you are used to confronting the truth?" 
"No," said the man with a puzzled frown. "I mean that I made an excuse and left early." 
He collapsed into a coma from which he recovered only once and briefly. 
On that one occasion, they discovered from him the following: 
When it became clear that Prak could not be stopped, that here was truth in its absolute and final form, the court was cleared. 
Not only cleared, it was sealed up, with Prak still in it. Steel walls were erected around it, and, just to be on the safe side, barbed wire, electric fences, crocodile swamps and three major armies were installed, so that no one would ever have to hear Prak speak. 
"That's a pity," said Arthur. "I'd like to hear what he had to say. Presumably he would know what the Ultimate Question to the Ultimate Answer is. It's always bothered me that we never found out." 
"Think of a number," said the computer, " any number." 
Arthur told the computer the telephone number of King's Cross railway station passenger inquiries, on the grounds that it must have some function, and this might turn out to be it. 
The computer injected the number into the ship's reconstituted Improbability Drive. 
In Relativity, Matter tells Space how to curve, and Space tells Matter how to move. 
The Heart of Gold told space to get knotted, and parked itself neatly within the inner steel perimeter of the Argabuthon Chamber of Law. 
The courtroom was an austere place, a large dark chamber, clearly designed for Justice rather than, for instance, for Pleasure. You wouldn't hold a dinner party here at least, not a successful one. The decor would get your guests down. 
The ceilings were high, vaulted and very dark. Shadows lurked there with grim determination. The panelling for the walls and benches, the cladding of the heavy pillars, all were carved from the darkest and most severe trees in the fearsome Forest of Arglebard. The massive black Podium of Justice which dominated the centre of the chamber was a monster of gravity. If a sunbeam had ever managed to slink this far into the Justice complex of Argabuthon it would have turned around and slunk straight back out again. 
Arthur and Trillian were the first in, whilst Ford and Zaphod bravely kept a watch on their rear. 
At first it seemed totally dark and deserted. Their footsteps echoed hollowly round the chamber. This seemed curious. All the defences were still in position and operative around the outside of the building, they had run scan checks. Therefore, they had assumed, the truth- telling must still be going on. 
But there was nothing. 
Then, as their eyes became accustomed to the darkness, they spotted a dull red glow in a corner, and behind the glow a live shadow. They swung a torch round on to it. 
Prak was lounging on a bench, smoking a listless cigarette. 
"Hi," he said, with a little half-wave. His voice echoed through the chamber. He was a little man with scraggy hair. He sat with his shoulders hunched forward and his head and knees kept jiggling. He took a drag of his cigarette. 
They stared at him. 
"What's going on?" said Trillian. 
"Nothing," said the man and jiggled his shoulders. 
Arthur shone his torch full on Prak's face. 
"We thought," he said, "that you were meant to be telling the Truth, the Whole Truth and Nothing but the Truth." 
"Oh, that," said Prak. "Yeah. I was. I finished. There's not nearly as much of it as people imagine. Some of it's pretty funny, though." 
He suddenly exploded in about three seconds of manical laughter and stopped again. he sat there, jiggling his head and knees. He dragged on his cigarette with a strange half-smile. 
Ford and Zaphod came forward out of the shadows. 
"Tell us about it," said Ford. 
"Oh, I can't remember any of it now," said Prak. "I thought of writing some of it down, but first I couldn't find a pencil, and then I thought, why bother?" 
There was a long silence, during which they thought they could feel the Universe age a little. Prak stared into the torchlight. 
"None of it?" said Arthur at last. "You can remember none of it?" 
"No. Except most of the good bits were about frogs, I remember that." 
Suddenly he was hooting with laughter again and stamping his feet on the ground. 
"You would not believe some of the things about frogs," he gasped. "Come on let's go and find ourselves a frog. Boy, will I ever see them in a new light!" He leapt to his feet and did a tiny little dance. Then he stopped and took a long drag at his cigarette. 
"Let's find a frog I can laugh at," he said simply. "Anyway, who are you guys?" 
"We came to find you," said Trillian, deliberately not keeping the disappointment out of her voice. "My name is Trillian." 
Prak jiggled his head.â¨"Ford Prefect," said Ford Prefect with a shrug. Prak jiggled his head. 
"And I," said Zaphod, when he judged that the silence was once again deep enough to allow an announcement of such gravity to be tossed in lightly, "am Zaphod Beeblebrox." 
Prak jiggled his head. 
"Who's this guy?" said Prak jiggling his shoulder at Arthur, who was standing silent for a moment, lost in disappointed thoughts. 
"Me?" said Arthur. "Oh, my name's Arthur Dent." 
Prak's eyes popped out of his head. 
"No kidding?" he yelped. "You are Arthur Dent? The Arthur Dent?" 
He staggered backwards, clutching his stomach and convulsed with fresh paroxysms o laughter. 
"Hey, just think of meeting you!" he gasped. "Boy," he shouted, "you are the most... wow, you just leave the frogs standing!" 
He howled and screamed with laughter. He fell over backwards on to the bench. He hollered and yelled in hysterics. He cried with laughter, he kicked his legs in the air, he beat his chest. Gradually he subsided, panting. He looked at them. He looked at Arthur. He fell back again howling with laughter. Eventually he fell asleep. 
Arthur stood there with his lips twitching whilst the others carried Prak comatose on to the ship. 
"Before we picked up Prak," said Arthur, "I was going to leave. I still want to, and I think I should do so as soon as possible." 
The others nodded in silence, a silence which was only slightly undermined by the heavily muffled and distant sound of hysterical laughter which came drifting from Prak's cabin at the farthest end of the ship. 
"We have questioned him," continued Arthur, "or at least, youâ¨have questioned him I, as you know, can't go near him on everything, and he doesn't really seem to have anything to contribute. Just the occasional snippet, and things I don't want to hear about frogs." 
The others tried not to smirk. 
"Now, I am the first to appreciate a joke," said Arthur and then had to wait for the others to stop laughing. 
"I am the first..." he stopped again. This time he stopped and listened to the silence. There actually was silence this time, and it had come very suddenly. 
Prak was quiet. For days they had lived with constant manical laughter ringing round the ship, only occasionally relieved by short periods of light giggling and sleep. Arthur's very soul was clenched with paranoia. 
This was not the silence of sleep. A buzzer sounded. A glance at a board told them that the buzzer had been sounded by Prak. 
"He's not well," said Trillian quietly. "The constant laughing is completely wrecking his body." 
Arthur's lips twitched but he said nothing. "We'd better go and see him," said Trillian. 
Trillian came out of the cabin wearing her serious face. 
"He wants you to go in," she said to Arthur, who was wearing his glum and tight-lipped one. He thrust his hands deep into his dressing- gown pockets and tried to think of something to say which wouldn't sound petty. It seemed terribly unfair, but he couldn't. 
"Please," said Trillian. 
He shrugged and went in, taking his glum and tight-lipped face with him, despite the reaction this always provoked from Prak. 
He looked down at his tormentor, who was lying quietly on the bed, ashen and wasted. His breathing was very shallow. Ford and Zaphod were standing by the bed looking awkward. 
"You wanted to ask me something," said Prak in a thin voice and coughed slightly. 
Just the cough made Arthur stiffen, but it passed and subsided. "How do you know that?" he asked.â¨Prak shrugged weakly. "'Cos it's true," he said simply.â¨Arthur took the point. 
"Yes," he said at last in rather a strained drawl. "I did have a question. Or rather, what I actually have is an Answer. I wanted to know what the Question was." 
Prak nodded sympathetically, and Arthur relaxed a little. 
"It's... well, it's a long story," he said, "but the Question I would like to know is the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything. All we know is that the Answer is Forty-Two, which is a little aggravating." 
Prak nodded again. 
"Forty-Two," he said. "Yes, that's right." 
He paused. Shadows of thought and memory crossed his face like the shadows of clouds crossing the land. 
"I'm afraid," he said at last, "that the Question and the Answer are mutually exclusive. Knowledge of one logically precludes knowledge of the other. It is impossible that both can ever be known about the same universe." 
He paused again. Disappointment crept into Arthur's face and snuggled down into its accustomed place. 
"Except," said Prak, struggling to sort a thought out, "if it happened, it seems that the Question and the Answer would just cancel each other out and take the Universe with them, which would then be replaced by something even more bizarrely inexplicable. It is possible that this has already happened," he added with a weak smile, "but there is a certain amount of Uncertainty about it." 
A little giggle brushed through him. 
Arthur sat down on a stool. 
"Oh well," he said with resignation, "I was just hoping there would be some sort of reason." 
"Do you know," said Prak, "the story of the Reason?"â¨Arthur said that he didn't, and Prak said that he knew that he didn't. He told it. 
One night, he said, a spaceship appeared in the sky of a planet which had never seen one before. The planet was Dalforsas, the ship was this one. It appeared as a brilliant new star moving silently across the heavens. 
Primitive tribesmen who were sitting huddled on the Cold Hillsides looked up from their steaming night-drinks and pointed with trembling fingers, swearing that they had seen a sign, a sign from their gods which meant that they must now arise at last and go and slay the evil Princes of the Plains. 
In the high turrets of their palaces, the Princes of the Plains looked up and saw the shining star, and received it unmistakably as a sign from their gods that they must now go and set about the accursed Tribesmen of the Cold Hillsides. 
And between them, the Dwellers in the Forest looked up into the sky and saw the sigh of the new star, and saw it with fear and apprehension, for though they had never seen anything like it before, they too knew precisely what it foreshadowed, and they bowed their heads in despair. 
They knew that when the rains came, it was a sign. When the rains departed, it was a sign.â¨When the winds rose, it was a sign. 
When the winds fell, it was a sign. 
When in the land there was born at midnight of a full moon a goat with three heads, that was a sign. 
When in the land there was born at some time in the afternoon a perfectly normal cat or pig with no birth complications at all, or even just a child with a retrousse nose, that too would often be taken as a sign. 
So there was no doubt at all that a new star in the sky was a sign of a particularly spectacular order. 
And each new sign signified the same thing that the Princes of the Plains and the Tribesmen of the Cold Hillsides were about to beat the hell out of each other again. 
This in itself wouldn't be so bad, except that the Princes of the Plains and the Tribesmen of the Cold Hillsides always elected to beat the hell out of each other in the Forest, and it was always the Dwellers in the Forest who came off worst in these exchanges, though as far as they could see it never had anything to do with them. 
And sometimes, after some of the worst of these outrages, the Dwellers in the Forest would send a messenger to either the leader of the Princes of the Plains or the leader of the Tribesmen of the Cold Hillsides and demand to know the reason for this intolerable behaviour. 
And the leader, whichever one it was, would take the messenger aside and explain the Reason to him, slowly and carefully and with great attention to the considerable detail involved. 
And the terrible thing was, it was a very good one. It was very clear, very rational, and tough. The messenger would hang his head and feel sad and foolish that he had not realized what a tough and complex place the real world was, and what difficulties and paradoxes had to be embraced if one was to live in it. 
"Now do you understand?" the leader would say. The messenger would nod dumbly.â¨"And you see these battles have to take place?" Another dumb nod. 
"And why they have to take place in the forest, and why it is in everybody's best interest, the Forest Dwellers included, that they should?" 
"Er..."â¨"In the long run." "Er, yes." 
And the messenger did understand the Reason, and he returned to his people in the Forest. But as he approached them, as he walked through the Forest and amongst the trees, he found that all he could remember of the Reason was how terribly clear the argument had seemed. What it actually was he couldn't remember at all. 
And this, of course, was a great comfort when next the Tribesmen and the Princes came hacking and burning their way through the Forest, killing every Forest Dweller in their way. 
Prak paused in his story and coughed pathetically. 
"I was the messenger," he said, "after the battles precipitated by the appearance of your ship, which were particularly savage. Many of our people died. I thought I could bring the Reason back. I went and was told it by the leader of the Princes, but on the way back it slipped and melted away in my mind like snow in the sun. That was many years ago, and much has happened since then." 
He looked up at Arthur and giggled again very gently. 
"There is one other thing I can remember from the truth drug. Apart from the frogs, and that is God's last message to his creation. Would you like to hear it?" 
For a moment they didn't know whether to take him seriously. 
"'Strue," he said. "For real. I mean it." 
His chest heaved weakly and he struggled for breath. His head lolled slightly. 
"I wasn't very impressed with it when I first knew what it was," he said, "but now I think back to how impressed I was by the Prince's Reason, and how soon afterwards I couldn't recall it at all, I think it might be a lot more helpful. Would you like to know what it is? Would you?" 
They nodded dumbly. 
"I bet you would. If you're that interested I suggest you go and look for it. It is written in thirty-foot-high letters of fire on top of the 
Quentulus Quazgar Mountains in the land of Sevorbeupstry on the planet Preliumtarn, third out from the sun Zarss in Galactic Sector QQ7 Active J Gamma. It is guarded by the Lajestic Vantrashell of Lob." 
There was a long silence following this announcement, which was finally broken by Arthur. 
"Sorry, it's where?" he said. 
"It is written," repeated Prak, "in thirty-foot-high letters of fire on top of the Quentulus Quazgar Mountains in the land of Sevorbeupstry on the planet Preliumtarn, third out from the..." 
"Sorry," said Arthur again, "which mountains?" 
"The Quentulus Quazgar Mountains in the land of Sevorbeupstry on the planet..." 
"Which land was that? I didn't quite catch it." "Sevorbeupstry, on the planet..."â¨"Sevorbe what?"â¨"Oh, for heaven's sake," said Prak and died testily. 
In the following days Arthur thought a little about this message, but in the end he decided that he was not going to allow himself to be drawn by it, and insisted on following his original plan of finding a nice little world somewhere to settle down and lead a quiet retired life. Having saved the Universe twice in one day he thought that he could take things a little easier from now on. 
They dropped him off on the planet Krikkit, which was now once again an idyllic pastoral world, even if the songs did occasionally get on his nerves. 
He spent a lot of time flying. 
He learnt to communicate with birds and discovered that their conversation was fantastically boring. It was all to do with wind speed, wing spans, power-to-weight ratios and a fair bit about berries. Unfortunately, he discovered, once you have learnt birdspeak you quickly come to realize that the air is full of it the whole time, just inane bird chatter. There is no getting away from it. 
For that reason Arthur eventually gave up the sport and learnt to live on the ground and love it, despite a lot of the inane chatter he heard down there as well. 
One day, he was walking through the fields humming a ravishing tune he'd heard recently when a silver spaceship descended from the sky and landed in front of him. 
A hatchway opened, a ramp extended, and a tall grey-green alien marched out and approached him. 
"Arthur Phili..." it said, then glanced sharply at him and down at his clipboard. He frowned. He looked up at him again. 
"I've done you before haven't I?" he said.

Preface 
Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun. 
Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea. 
This planet has or rather had a problem, which was this: mostâ¨of the people on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy. 
And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and most of them were miserable, even the ones with digital watches. 
Many were increasingly of the opinion that they'd all made a big mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place. And some said that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no one should ever have left the oceans. 
And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to people for a change, one girl sitting on her own in a small cafe in Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that had been going wrong all this time, and she finally knew how the world could be made a good and happy place. This time it was right, it would work, and no one would have to get nailed to anything. 
Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone to tell anyone about it, a terribly stupid catastrophe occurred, and the idea was lost forever. 
This is her story. 
Chapter 1 
That evening it was dark early, which was normal for the time of year. It was cold and windy, which was normal. 
It started to rain, which was particularly normal. 
A spacecraft landed, which was not. 
There was nobody around to see it except some spectacularly stupid quadrupeds who hadn't the faintest idea what to make of it, or whether they were meant to make anything of it, or eat it, or what. So they did what they did to everything which was to run away from it and try to hide under each other, which never worked. 
It slipped down out of the clouds, seemingly balanced on a single beam of light. 
From a distance you would scarcely have noticed it through the lightning and the storm clouds, but seen from close to it was strangely beautiful a grey craft of elegantly sculpted form: quite small. 
Of course, one never has the slightest notion what size or shape different species are going to turn out to be, but if you were to take the findings of the latest Mid-Galactic Census report as any kind of accurate Guide to statistical averages you would probably guess that the craft would hold about six people, and you would be right. 
You'd probably guessed that anyway. The Census report, like most such surveys, had cost an awful lot of money and didn't tell anybody anything they didn't already know except that every single person in the Galaxy had 2.4 legs and owned a hyena. Since this was clearly not true the whole thing had eventually to be scrapped. 
The craft slid quietly down through the rain, its dim operating lights wrapping it in tasteful rainbows. It hummed very quietly, a hum which became gradually louder and deeper as it approached the ground, and which at an altitude of six inches became a heavy throb. 
At last it dropped and was quiet.â¨A hatchway opened. A short flight of steps unfolded itself. 
A light appeared in the opening, a bright light streaming out into the wet night, and shadows moved within. 
A tall figure appeared in the light, looked around, flinched, and hurried down the steps, carrying a large shopping bag under its arm. 
It turned and gave a single abrupt wave back at the ship. Already the rain was streaming through its hair. 
"Thank you," he called out, "thank you very..." 
He was interrupted by a sharp crack of thunder. He glanced up apprehensively, and in response to a sudden thought quickly started to rummage through the large plastic shopping bag, which he now discovered had a hole in the bottom. 
It had large characters printed on the side which read (to anyone who could decipher the Centaurian alphabet) DUTY FREE MEGA- MARKET, PORT BRASTA, ALPHA CENTAURI. BE LIKE THE TWENTY- SECOND ELEPHANT WITH HEATED VALUE IN SPACE-BARK! 
"Hold on!" the figure called, waving at the ship. 
The steps, which had started to fold themselves back through the hatchway, stopped, re-unfolded, and allowed him back in. 
He emerged again a few seconds later carrying a battered and threadbare towel which he shoved into the bag. 
He waved again, hoisted the bag under his arm, and started to run for the shelter of some trees as, behind him, the spacecraft had already begun its ascent. 
Lightning flitted through the sky and made the figure pause for a moment, and then hurry onwards, revising his path to give the trees a wide berth. He moved swiftly across the ground, slipping here and there, hunching himself against the rain which was falling now with ever-increasing concentration, as if being pulled from the sky. 
His feet sloshed through the mud. Thunder grumbled over the hills. He pointlessly wiped the rain off his face and stumbled on. 
More lights. 
Not lightning this time, but more diffused and dimmer lights which played slowly over the horizon and faded. 
The figure paused again on seeing them, and then redoubled his steps, making directly towards the point on the horizon at which they had appeared. 
And now the ground was becoming steeper, sloping upwards, and after another two or three hundred yards it led at last to an obstacle. The figure paused to examine the barrier and then dropped the bag he was carrying over it before climbing over himself. 
Hardly had the figure touched the ground on the other side when there came sweeping out of the rain towards him a machine, lights streaming through the wall of water. The figure pressed back as the machine streaked towards him. It was a low bulbous shape, like a small whale surfing sleek, grey and rounded and moving at terrifying speed. 
The figure instinctively threw up his hands to protect himself, but was hit only by a sluice of water as the machine swept past and off into the night. 
It was illuminated briefly by another flicker of lightning crossing the sky, which allowed the soaked figure by the roadside a split-second to read a small sign at the back of the machine before it disappeared. 
To the figure's apparent incredulous astonishment the sign read, "My other car is also a Porsche." 
Chapter 2 
Rob McKeena was a miserable bastard and he knew it because he'd had a lot of people point it out to him over the years and he saw no reason to disagree with them except the obvious one which was that he liked disagreeing with people, particularly people he disliked, which included, at the last count, everyone. 
He heaved a sigh and shoved down a gear. 
The hill was beginning to steepen and his lorry was heavy with Danish thermostatic radiator controls. 
It wasn't that he was naturally predisposed to be so surly, at least he hoped not. It was just the rain which got him down, always the rain. 
It was raining now, just for a change. 
It was a particular type of rain he particularly disliked, particularly when he was driving. He had a number for it. It was rain type 17. 
He had read somewhere that the Eskimos had over two hundred different words for snow, without which their conversation would probably have got very monotonous. So they would distinguish between thin snow and thick snow, light snow and heavy snow,â¨sludgy snow, brittle snow, snow that came in flurries, snow that came in drifts, snow that came in on the bottom of your neighbour's boots all over your nice clean igloo floor, the snows of winter, the snows of spring, the snows you remember from your childhood that were so much better than any of your modern snow, fine snow, feathery snow, hill snow, valley snow, snow that falls in the morning, snow that falls at night, snow that falls all of a sudden just when you were going out fishing, and snow that despite all your efforts to train them, the huskies have pissed on. 
Rob McKeena had two hundred and thirty-one different types of rain entered in his little book, and he didn't like any of them. 
He shifted down another gear and the lorry heaved its revs up. It grumbled in a comfortable sort of way about all the Danish thermostatic radiator controls it was carrying. 
Since he had left Denmark the previous afternoon, he had been through types 33 (light pricking drizzle which made the roads slippery), 39 (heavy spotting), 47 to 51 (vertical light drizzle through to sharply slanting light to moderate drizzle freshening), 87 and 88 (two finely distinguished varieties of vertical torrential downpour), 100 (post- downpour squalling, cold), all the seastorm types between 192 and 213 at once, 123, 124, 126, 127 (mild and intermediate cold gusting, regular and syncopated cab-drumming), 11 (breezy droplets), andâ¨now his least favourite of all, 17. 
Rain type 17 was a dirty blatter battering against his windscreen so hard that it didn't make much odds whether he had his wipers on or off. 
He tested this theory by turning them off briefly, but as it turned out the visibility did get quite a lot worse. It just failed to get better again when he turned them back on. 
In fact one of the wiper blades began to flap off. 
Swish swish swish flop swish flop swish swish flop swish flop swish flop flop flop scrape. 
He pounded his steering wheel, kicked the floor, thumped his cassette player till it suddenly started playing Barry Manilow, thumped it again till it stopped, and swore and swore and swore and swore and swore. 
It was at the very moment that his fury was peaking that there loomed swimmingly in his headlights, hardly visible through the blatter, a figure by the roadside. 
A poor bedraggled figure, strangely attired, wetter than an otter in a washing machine, and hitching. 
"Poor miserable sod," thought Rob McKeena to himself, realizing that here was somebody with a better right to feel hard done by than himself, "must be chilled to the bone. Stupid to be out hitching on a filthy night like this. All you get is cold, wet, and lorries driving through puddles at you." 
He shook his head grimly, heaved another sigh, gave the wheel a turn and hit a large sheet of water square on. 
"See what I mean?" he thought to himself as he ploughed swiftly through it. "You get some right bastards on the road." 
Splattered in his rear mirror a couple of seconds later was the reflection of the hitch-hiker, drenched by the roadside. 
For a moment he felt good about this. A moment or two later he felt bad about feeling good about it. Then he felt good about feeling bad about feeling good about it and, satisfied, drove on into the night. 
At least it made up for having been finally overtaken by that Porsche he had been diligently blocking for the last twenty miles. 
And as he drove on, the rainclouds dragged down the sky after him, for, though he did not know it, Rob McKeena was a Rain God. All he knew was that his working days were miserable and he had a succession of lousy holidays. All the clouds knew was that they loved him and wanted to be near him, to cherish him, and to water him. 
Chapter 3 
The next two lorries were not driven by Rain Gods, but they did exactly the same thing. 
The figure trudged, or rather sloshed, onwards till the hill resumed and the treacherous sheet of water was left behind. 
After a while the rain began to ease and the moon put in a brief appearance from behind the clouds. 
A Renault drove by, and its driver made frantic and complex signals to the trudging figure to indicate that he would have been delighted to give the figure a lift, only he couldn't this time because he wasn't going in the direction that the figure wanted to go, whatever direction that might be, and he was sure the figure would understand. He concluded the signalling with a cheery thumbs-up sign, as if to say that he hoped the figure felt really fine about being cold and almost terminally wet, and he would catch him the next time around. 
The figure trudged on. A Fiat passed and did exactly the same as the Renault. 
A Maxi passed on the other side of the road and flashed its lights at the slowly plodding figure, though whether this was meant to convey a "Hello" or a "Sorry we're going the other way" or a "Hey look, there's someone in the rain, what a jerk" was entirely unclear. A green strip across the top of the windscreen indicated that whatever the message was, it came from Steve and Carola. 
The storm had now definitely abated, and what thunder there was now grumbled over more distant hills, like a man saying "And another thing..." twenty minutes after admitting he's lost the argument. 
The air was clearer now, the night cold. Sound travelled rather well. The lost figure, shivering desperately, presently reached a junction, where a side road turned off to the left. Opposite the turning stood a signpost which the figure suddenly hurried to and studied with feverish curiosity, only twisting away from it as another car passed suddenly. 
And another. 
The first whisked by with complete disregard, the second flashed meaninglessly. A Ford Cortina passed and put on its brakes. 
Lurching with surprise, the figure bundled his bag to his chest and hurried forward towards the car, but at the last moment the Cortina span its wheels in the wet and carreered off up the road rather amusingly. 
The figure slowed to a stop and stood there, lost and dejected. 
As it chanced, the following day the driver of the Cortina went into hospital to have his appendix out, only due to a rather amusing mix up the surgeon removed his leg in error, and before the appendectomy could be rescheduled, the appendicitis complicated into an entertainingly serious case of peritonitis and justice, in its way, was served. 
The figure trudged on. 
A Saab drew to a halt beside him. 
Its window wound down and a friendly voice said, "Have you come far?" 
The figure turned toward it. He stopped and grasped the handle of the door. 
The figure, the car and its door handle were all on a planet called the Earth, a world whose entire entry in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy comprised the two words "Mostly harmless". 
The man who wrote this entry was called Ford Prefect, and he was at this precise moment on a far from harmless world, sitting in a far from harmless bar, recklessly causing trouble. 
Chapter 4 
Whether it was because he was drunk, ill or suicidally insane would not have been apparent to a casual observer, and indeed there were no casual observers in the Old Pink Dog Bar on the lower South Side of Han Dold City because it wasn't the sort of place you could afford to do things casually in if you wanted to stay alive. Any observers in the place would have been mean hawklike observers, heavily armed, with painful throbbings in their heads which caused them to do crazy things when they observed things they didn't like. 
One of those nasty hushes had descended on the place, a sort of missile crisis sort of hush. 
Even the evil-looking bird perched on a rod in the bar had stopped screeching out the names and addresses of local contract killers, which was a service it provided for free. 
All eyes were on Ford Prefect. Some of them were on stalks. 
The particular way in which he was choosing to dice recklessly with death today was by trying to pay for a drinks bill the size of a small defence budget with an American Express Card, which was not acceptable anywhere in the known Universe. 
"What are you worried about?" he asked in a cheery kind of voice. "The expiration date? Have you guys never heard of Neo-Relativity out here? There's whole new areas of physics which can take care of this sort of thing. Time dilation effects, temporal relastatics..." 
"We are not worried about the expiration date," said the man to whom he addressed these remarks, who was a dangerous barman in a dangerous city. His voice was a low soft purr, like the low soft purr made by the opening of an ICBM silo. A hand like a side of meat tapped on the bar top, lightly denting it. 
"Well, that's good then," said Ford, packing his satchel and preparing to leave. 
The tapping finger reached out and rested lightly on the shoulder of Ford Prefect. It prevented him from leaving. 
Although the finger was attached to a slablike hand, and the hand was attached to a clublike forearm, the forearm wasn't attached to anything at all, except in the metaphorical sense that it was attached by a fierce doglike loyalty to the bar which was its home. It had previously been more conventionally attached to the original owner of the bar, who on his deathbed had unexpectedly bequeathed it to medical science. Medical science had decided they didn't like the look of it and had bequeathed it right back to the Old Pink Dog Bar. 
The new barman didn't believe in the supernatural or poltergeists or anything kooky like that, he just knew an useful ally when he saw one. The hand sat on the bar. It took orders, it served drinks, it dealt murderously with people who behaved as if they wanted to be murdered. Ford Prefect sat still. 
"We are not worried about the expiration date," repeated the barman, satisfied that he now had Ford Prefect's full attention. "We are worried about the entire piece of plastic." 
"What?" said Ford. He seemed a little taken aback. 
"This," said the barman, holding out the card as if it was a small fish whose soul had three weeks earlier winged its way to the Land Where Fish are Eternally Blessed, "we don't accept it." 
Ford wondered briefly whether to raise the fact that he didn't have any other means of payment on him, but decided for the moment to soldier on. The disembodied hand was now grasping his shoulder lightly but firmly between its finger and thumb. 
"But you don't understand," said Ford, his expression slowly ripening from a little taken abackness into rank incredulity. "This is the American Express Card. It is the finest way of settling bills known to man. Haven't you read their junk mail?" 
The cheery quality of Ford's voice was beginning to grate on the barman's ears. It sounded like someone relentlessly playing the kazoo during one of the more sombre passages of a War Requiem. 
One of the bones in Ford's shoulder began to grate against another one of the bones in his shoulder in a way which suggested that the hand had learnt the principles of pain from a highly skilled chiropracter. He hoped he could get this business settled before the hand started to grate one of the bones in his shoulder against any of the bones in different parts of his body. Luckily, the shoulder it was holding was not the one he had his satchel slung over. 
The barman slid the card back across the bar at Ford. 
"We have never," he said with muted savagery, "heard of this thing." 
This was hardly surprising. 
Ford had only acquired it through a serious computer error towards the end of the fifteen years' sojourn he had spent on the planet Earth. Exactly how serious, the American Express Company had got to know very rapidly, and the increasingly strident and panic- stricken demands of its debt collection department were only silenced by the unexpected demolition of the entire planet by the Vogons to make way for a new hyperspace bypass. 
He had kept it ever since because he found it useful to carry a form of currency that no one would accept. 
"Credit?" he said. "Aaaargggh..." 
These two words were usually coupled together in the Old Pink Dog Bar. 
"I thought," gasped Ford, "that this was meant to be a class establishment..." 
He glanced around at the motley collection of thugs, pimps and record company executives that skulked on the edges of the dim pools of light with which the dark shadows of the bar's inner recesses were pitted. They were all very deliberately looking in any direction but his now, carefully picking up the threads of their former conversations about murders, drug rings and music publishing deals. They knew what would happen now and didn't want to watch in case it put them off their drinks. 
"You gonna die, boy," the barman murmured quietly at Ford Prefect, and the evidence was on his side. The bar used to have one of those signs hanging up which said, "Please don't ask for credit as a punch in the mouth often offends", but in the interest of strict accuracy this was altered to, "Please don't ask for credit because having your throat torn out by a savage bird while a disembodied hand smashes your head against the bar often offends". However,â¨this made an unreadable mess of the notice, and anyway didn't have the same ring to it, so it was taken down again. It was felt that the story would get about of its own accord, and it had. 
"Lemme look at the bill again," said Ford. He picked it up and studied it thoughtfully under the malevolent gaze of the barman, and the equally malevolent gaze of the bird, which was currently gouging great furrows in the bar top with its talons. 
It was a rather lengthy piece of paper. 
At the bottom of it was a number which looked like one of those serial numbers you find on the underside of stereo sets which always takes so long to copy on to the registration form. He had, after all, been in the bar all day, he had been drinking a lot of stuff with bubbles in it, and he had bought an awful lot of rounds for all the pimps, thugs and record executives who suddenly couldn't remember who he was. 
He cleared his throat rather quietly and patted his pockets. There was, as he knew, nothing in them. He rested his left hand lightly but firmly on the half-opened flap of his satchel. The disembodied hand renewed its pressure on his right shoulder. 
"You see," said the barman, and his face seemed to wobble evilly in front of Ford's, "I have a reputation to think of. You see that, don't you?" 
This is it, thought Ford. There was nothing else for it. He had obeyed the rules, he had made a bona fide attempt to pay his bill, it had been rejected. He was now in danger of his life. 
"Well," he said quietly, "if it's your reputation..." 
With a sudden flash of speed he opened his satchel and slapped down on the bar top his copy of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and the official card which said that he was a field researcher for the Guide and absolutely not allowed to do what he was now doing. 
"Want a write-up?" 
The barman's face stopped in mid-wobble. The bird's talons stopped in mid-furrow. The hand slowly released its grip. 
"That," said the barman in a barely audible whisper, from between dry lips, "will do nicely, sir." 
Chapter 5 
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a powerful organ. Indeed, its influence is so prodigious that strict rules have had to be drawn up by its editorial staff to prevent its misuse. So none of its field researchers are allowed to accept any kind of services, discounts or preferential treatment of any kind in return for editorial favours unless: 
a) they have made a bona fide attempt to pay for a service in the normal way; 
b) their lives would be otherwise in danger; 
c) they really want to. 
Since invoking the third rule always involved giving the editor a cut, Ford always preferred to much about with the first two. 
He stepped out along the street, walking briskly. 
The air was stifling, but he liked it because it was stifling city air, full of excitingly unpleasant smells, dangerous music and the sound of warring police tribes. 
He carried his satchel with an easy swaying motion so that he could get a good swing at anybody who tried to take it from him without asking. It contained everything he owned, which at the moment wasn't much. 
A limousine careered down the street, dodging between the piles of burning garbage, and frightening an old pack animal which lurched, screeching, out of its way, stumbled against the window of a herbal remedies shop, set off a wailing alarm, blundered off down the street, and then pretended to fall down the steps of a small pasta restaurant where it knew it would get photographed and fed. 
Ford was walking north. He thought he was probably on his way to the spaceport, but he had thought that before. He knew he was going through that part of the city where people's plans often changed quite abruptly. 
"Do you want to have a good time?" said a voice from a doorway. 
"As far as I can tell," said Ford, "I'm having one. Thanks." 
"Are you rich?" said another. 
This made Ford laugh. 
He turned and opened his arms in a wide gesture. "Do I look rich?" he said. 
"Don't know," said the girl. "Maybe, maybe not. Maybe you'll get rich. I have a very special service for rich people..." 
"Oh yes?" said Ford, intrigued but careful. "And what's that?" 
"I tell them it's OK to be rich." 
Gunfire erupted from a window high above them, but it was only a bass player getting shot for playing the wrong riff three times in a row, and bass players are two a penny in Han Dold City. 
Ford stopped and peered into the dark doorway. 
"You what?" he said. 
The girl laughed and stepped forward a little out of the shadow. She was tall, and had that kind of self-possessed shyness which is a great trick if you can do it. 
"It's my big number," she saÃ©d. "I have a Master's degree in Social Economics and can be very convincing. People love it. Especially in this city." 
"Goosnargh," said Ford Prefect, which was a special Betelgeusian word he used when he knew he should say something but didn't know what it should be. 
He sat on a step, took from his satchel a bottle of that Ol' Janx Spirit and a towel. He opened the bottle and wiped the top of it with the towel, which had the opposite effect to the one intended, in that the Ol' Janx Spirit instantly killed off millions of the germs which had been slowly building up quite a complex and enlightened civilization on the smellier patches of the towel. 
"Want some?" he said, after he'd had a swig himself. 
She shrugged and took the proffered bottle. 
They sat for a while, peacefully listening to the clamour of burglar alarms in the next block. 
"As it happens, I'm owed a lot of money," said Ford, "so if I ever get hold of it, can I come and see you then maybe?" 
"Sure, I'll be here," said the girl. "So how much is a lot?" 
"Fifteen years' back pay." 
"For?" 
"Writing two words." 
"Zarquon," said the girl. "Which one took the time?" 
"The first one. Once I'd got that the second one just came one afternoon after lunch." 
A huge electronic drum kit hurtled through the window high above them and smashed itself to bits in the street in front of them. 
It soon became apparent that some of the burglar alarms on the next block had been deliberately set off by one police tribe in order to lay an ambush for the other. Cars with screaming sirens converged on the area, only to find themselves being picked off by copters which came thudding through the air between the city's mountainous tower blocks. 
"In fact," said Ford, having to shout now above the din, "it wasn't quite like that. I wrote an awful lot, but they just cut it down." 
He took his copy of the Guide back out of his satchel. 
"Then the planet got demolished," he shouted. "Really worthwhile job, eh? They've still got to pay me, though." 
"You work for that thing?" the girl yelled back. "Yeah."â¨"Good number." 
"You want to see the stuff I wrote?" he shouted. "Before it gets erased? The new revisions are due to be released tonight over the net. Someone must have found out that the planet I spent fifteen years on has been demolished by now. They missed it on the last few revisions, but it can't escape their notice for ever." 
"It's getting impossible to talk isn't it?" "What?"â¨She shrugged and pointed upwards. 
There was a copter above them now which seemed to be involved in a side skirmish with the band upstairs. Smoke was billowing from the building. The sound engineer was hanging out of the window by his fingertips, and a maddened guitarist was beating on his fingers with a burning guitar. The helicopter was firing at all of them. 
"Can we move?" 
They wandered down the street, away from the noise. They ran into a street theatre group which tried to do a short play for them about the problems of the inner city, but then gave up and disappeared into the small restaurant most recently patronized by the pack animal. 
All the time, Ford was poking at the interface panel of the Guide. They ducked into an alleyway. Ford squatted on a garbage can while information began to flood over the screen of the Guide. 
He located his entry.â¨"Earth: Mostly harmless."â¨Almost immediately the screen became a mass of system messages. "Here it comes," he said. 
"Please wait," said the messages. "Entries are being updated over the Sub-Etha Net. This entry is being revised. The system will be down for ten seconds." 
At the end of the alley a steel grey limousine crawled past. 
"Hey look," said the girl, "if you get paid, look me up. I'm a working girl, and there are people over there who need me. I gotta go." 
She brushed aside Ford's half-articulated protests, and left him sitting dejectedly on his garbage can preparing to watch a large swathe of his working life being swept away electronically into the ether. 
Out in the street things had calmed down a little. The police battle had moved off to other sectors of the city, the few surviving members of the rock band had agreed to recognize their musical differences and pursue solo careers, the street theatre group were re-emerging from the pasta restaurant with the pack animal, telling it they would take it to a bar they knew where it would be treated with a little respect, and a little way further on the steel grey limousine was parked silently by the kerbside. 
The girl hurried towards it. 
Behind her, in the darkness of the alley, a green flickering glow was bathing Ford Prefect's face, and his eyes were slowly widening in astonishment. 
For where he had expected to find nothing, an erased, closed-off entry, there was instead a continuous stream of data-text, diagrams, figures and images, moving descriptions of surf on Australian beaches, 
Yoghurt on Greek islands, restaurants to avoid in Los Angeles, currency deals to avoid in Istanbul, weather to avoid in London, bars to go everywhere. Pages and pages of it. It was all there, everything he had written. 
With a deepening frown of blank incomprehension he went backwards and forwards through it, stopping here and there at various entries. 
Tips for aliens in New York: 
Land anywhere, Central Park, anywhere. No one will care, or indeed even notice. 
Surviving: get a job as cab driver immediately. A cab driver's job is to drive people anywhere they want to go in big yellow machines called taxis. Don't worry if you don't know how the machine works and you can't speak the language, don't understand the geography or indeed the basic physics of the area, and have large green antennae growing out of your head. Believe me, this is the best way of staying inconspicuous. 
If your body is really weird try showing it to people in the streets for money. 
Amphibious life forms from any of the worlds in the Swulling, Noxios or Nausalia systems will particularly enjoy the East River, which is said to be richer in those lovely life-giving nutrients then the finest and most virulent laboratory slime yet achieved. 
Having fun: This is the big section. It is impossible to have more fun without electrocuting your pleasure centres... 
Ford flipped the switch which he saw was now marked "Mode Execute Ready" instead of the now old-fashioned "Access Standby" which had so long ago replaced the appallingly stone-aged "Off". 
This was a planet he had seen completely destroyed, seen with his own two eyes or rather, blinded as he had been by the hellish disruption of air and light, felt with his own two feet as the ground had started to pound at him like a hammer, bucking, roaring, gripped by tidal waves of energy pouring out of the loathsome yellow Vogon ships. And then at last, five seconds after the moment he had determined as being the last possible moment had already passed, 
the gently swinging nausea of dematerialization as he and Arthur Dent had been beamed up through the atmosphere like a sports broadcast. 
There was no mistake, there couldn't have been. The Earth had definitely been destroyed. Definitely, definitely. Boiled away into space. 
And yet here he activated the Guide again was his own entry on how you would set about having a good time in Bournemouth, Dorset, England, which he had always prided himself on as being one of the most baroque pieces of invention he had ever delivered. He read it again and shook his head in sheer wonder. 
Suddenly he realized what the answer to the problem was, and it was this, that something very weird was happening; and if something very weird was happening, he thought, he wanted it to be happening to him. 
He stashed the Guide back in his satchel and hurried out on to the street again. 
Walking north he again passed a steel grey limousine parked by the kerbside, and from a nearby doorway he heard a soft voice saying, "It's OK, honey, it's really OK, you got to learn to feel good about it. Look at the way the whole economy is structured ..." 
Ford grinned, detoured round the next block which was now in flames, found a police helicopter which was standing unattended in the street, broke into it, strapped himself in, crossed his fingers and sent it hurtling inexpertly into the sky. 
He weaved terrifyingly up through the canyoned walls of the city, and once clear of them, hurtled through the black and red pall of smoke which hung permanently above it. 
Ten minutes later, with all the copter's sirens blaring and its rapid- fire cannon blasting at random into the clouds, Ford Prefect brought it careering down among the gantries and landing lights at Han Dold spaceport, where it settled like a gigantic, startled and very noisy gnat. 
Since he hadn't damaged it too much he was able to trade it in for a first class ticket on the next ship leaving the system, and settled into one of its huge, voluptuous body-hugging seats. 
This was going to be fun, he thought to himself, as the ship blinked silently across the insane distances of deep space and the cabin service got into its full extravagant swing. 
"Yes please," he said to the cabin attendants whenever they glided up to offer him anything at all. 
He smiled with a curious kind of manic joy as he flipped again through the mysteriously re-instated entry on the planet Earth. He had a major piece of unfinished business that he would now be able to attend to, and was terribly pleased that life had suddenly furnished him with a serious goal to achieve. 
It suddenly occurred to him to wonder where Arthur Dent was, and if he knew. 
Arthur Dent was one thousand, four hundred and thirty-seven light years away in a Saab, and anxious. 
Behind him in the backseat was a girl who had made him crack his head on the door as he climbed in. He didn't know if it was just because she was the first female of his own species that he had laid eyes on in years, or what it was, but he felt stupefied with, with... This is absurd, he told himself. Calm down, he told himself. You are not, he continued to himself in the firmest internal voice he could muster, in a fit and rational state. You have just hitch-hiked over a hundred thousand light years across the galaxy, you are very tired, a little confused and extremely vulnerable. Relax, don't panic, concentrate on breathing deeply. 
He twisted round in his seat. 
"Are you sure she's all right?" he said again. 
Beyond the fact that she was, to him, heartthumpingly beautiful, he could make out very little, how tall she was, how old she was, the exact shading of her hair. And nor could he ask her anything about herself because, sadly, she was completely unconscious. 
"She's just drugged," said her brother, shrugging, not moving his eyes from the road ahead. 
"And that's all right, is it?" said Arthur, in alarm.â¨"Suits me," he said.â¨"Ah," said Arthur. "Er," he added after a moment's thought. The conversation so far had been going astoundingly badly. 
After an initial flurry of opening hellos, he and Russell the wonderful girl's brother's name was Russell, a name which, to Arthur's mind, always suggested burly men with blond moustaches and blow-dried hair, who would at the slightest provocation start wearing velvet tuxedos and frilly shirtfronts and would then have to be forcibly restrained from commentating on snooker matches had quickly discovered they didn't like each other at all. 
Russell was a burly man. He had a blond moustache. His hair was fine and blow dried. To be fair to him though Arthur didn't see any necessity for this beyond the sheer mental exercise of it he, Arthur, was looking pretty grim himself. A man can't cross a hundredâ¨thousand light years, mostly in other people's baggage compartments, without beginning to fray a little, and Arthur had frayed a lot. 
"She's not a junkie," said Russell suddenly, as if he clearly thought that someone else in the car might be. "She's under sedation." 
"But that's terrible," said Arthur, twisting round to look at her again. She seemed to stir slightly and her head slipped sideways on her shoulder. Her dark hair fell across her face, obscuring it. 
"What's the matter with her, is she ill?" "No," said Russell, "merely barking mad." "What?" said Arthur, horrified. 
"Loopy, completely bananas. I'm taking her back to the hospital and telling them to have another go. They let her out while she still thought she was a hedgehog." 
"A hedgehog?" 
Russell hooted his horn fiercely at the car that came round the corner towards them half-way on to their side of the road, making them swerve. The anger seemed to make him feel better. 
"Well, maybe not a hedgehog," he said after he'd settled down again. "Though it would probably be simpler to deal with if she did. If somebody thinks they're a hedgehog, presumably you just give 'em a mirror and a few pictures of hedgehogs and tell them to sort it out for themselves, come down again when they feel better. At least medical science could deal with it, that's the point. Seems that's no good enough for Fenny, though." 
"Fenny...?"â¨"You know what I got her for Christmas?" 
"Well, no."â¨"Black's Medical Dictionary."â¨"Nice present."â¨"I thought so. Thousands of diseases in it, all in alphabetical order." "You say her name is Fenny?" 
"Yeah. Take your pick, I said. Anything in here can be dealt with. The proper drugs can be prescribed. But no, she has to have something different. Just to make life difficult. She was like that at school, you know." 
"Was she?" 
"She was. Fell over playing hockey and broke a bone nobody had ever heard of." 
"I can see how that would be irritating," said Arthur doubtfully. He was rather disappointed to discover her name was Fenny. It was a rather silly, dispiriting name, such as an unlovely maiden aunt might vote herself if she couldn't sustain the name Fenella properly. 
"Not that I wasn't sympathetic," continued Russell, "but it did get a bit irritating. She was limping for months." 
He slowed down. 
"This is your turning isn't it?" 
"Ah, no," said Arthur, "five miles further on. If that's all right." 
"OK," said Russell after a very tiny pause to indicate that it wasn't, and speeded up again. 
It was in fact Arthur's turning, but he couldn't leave without finding out something more about this girl who seemed to have taken such a grip on his mind without even waking up. He could take either of the next two turnings. 
They led back to the village that had been his home, though what he would find there he hesitated to imagine. Familiar landmarks had been flitting by, ghostlike, in the dark, giving rise to the shudders that only very normal things can create, when seen where the mind is unprepared for them, and in an unfamiliar light. 
By his own personal time scale, so far as he could estimate it, living as he had been under the alien rotations of distant suns, it was eight years since he had left, but what time had passed here he could hardly guess. Indeed, what events had passed were beyond his 
exhausted comprehension because this planet, his home, should not be here. 
Eight years ago, at lunchtime, this planet had been demolished, utterly destroyed, by the huge yellow Vogon ships which had hung in the lunchtime sky as if the law of gravity was no more than a local regulation, and breaking it no more than a parking offence. 
"Delusions," said Russell. 
"What?" said Arthur, started out of his train of thought. 
"She says she suffers from strange delusions that she's living in the real world. It's no good telling her that she is living in the real world because she just says that's why the delusions are so strange. Don't know about you, but I find that kind of conversation pretty exhausting. Give her the tablets and piss off for a beer is my answer. I mean you can only muck about so much can't you?" 
Arthur frowned, not for the first time. 
"Well..." 
"And all this dreams and nightmare stuff. And the doctors going on about strange jumps in her brainwave patterns." 
"Jumps?" 
"This," said Fenny. 
Arthur whirled round in his seat and stared into her suddenly open but utterly vacant eyes. Whatever she was looking at wasn't in the car. Her eyes fluttered, her head jerked once, and then she was sleeping peacefully. 
"What did she say?" he asked anxiously. "She said 'this'."â¨"This what?" 
"This what? How the heck should I know? This hedgehog, that chimney pot, the other pair of Don Alfonso's tweezers. She's barking mad, I thought I'd mentioned that." 
"You don't seem to care very much." Arthur tried to say it as matter-of-factly as possible but it didn't seem to work. 
"Look, buster..." 
"OK, I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean it to sound like that," said Arthur. "I know you care a lot, obviously," he added, lying. "I know that you have to deal with it somehow. You'll have to 
excuse me. I just hitched from the other side of the Horsehead Nebula." 
He stared furiously out of the window. 
He was astonished that of all the sensations fighting for room in his head on this night as he returned to the home that he had thought had vanished into oblivion for ever, the one that was compelling him was an obsession with this bizarre girl of whom he knew nothing other than that she had said "this" to him, and that he wouldn't wish her brother on a Vogon. 
"So, er, what were the jumps, these jumps you mentioned?" he went on to say as quickly as he could. 
"Look, this is my sister, I don't even know why I'm talking to you about..." 
"OK, I'm sorry. Perhaps you'd better let me out. This is..." 
At the moment he said it, it became impossible, because the storm which had passed them by suddenly erupted again. Lightning belted through the sky, and someone seemed to be pouring something which closely resembled the Atlantic Ocean over them through a sieve. 
Russell swore and steered intently for a few seconds as the sky blattered at them. He worked out his anger by rashly accelerating to pass a lorry marked "McKeena's All-Weather Haulage". The tension eased as the rain subsided. 
"It started with all that business of the CIA agent they found in the reservoir, when everybody had all the hallucinations and everything, you remember?" 
Arthur wondered for a moment whether to mention again that he had just hitch-hiked back from the other side of the Horsehead Nebula and was for this and various other related and astounding reasons a little out of touch with recent events, but he decided it would only confuse matters further. 
"No," he said. 
"That was the moment she cracked up. She was in a cafe somewhere. Rickmansworth. Don't know what she was doing there, but that was where she cracked up. Apparently she stood up, calmly announced that she had undergone some extraordinary revelation or 
something, wobbled a bit, looked confused, and finally collapsed screaming into an egg sandwich." 
Arthur winced. "I'm very sorry to hear that," he said a little stiffly. 
Russell made a sort of grumping noise. 
"So what," said Arthur in an attempt to piece things together, "was the CIA agent doing in the reservoir?" 
"Bobbing up and down of course. He was dead." 
"But what..." 
"Come on, you remember all that stuff. The hallucinations. Everyone said it was a cock up, the CIA trying experiments into drug warfare or something. Some crackpot theory that instead of invading a country it would be much cheaper and more effective to make everyone think they'd been invaded." 
"What hallucinations were those exactly...?" said Arthur in a rather quiet voice. 
"What do you mean, what hallucinations? I'm talking about all that stuff with the big yellow ships, everyone going crazy and saying we're going to die, and then pop, they vanished as the effect wore off. The CIA denied it which meant it must be true." 
Arthur's head went a little swimmy. His hand grabbed at something to steady himself, and gripped it tightly. His mouth made little opening and closing movements as if it was on his mind to say something, but nothing emerged. 
"Anyway," continued Russell, "whatever drug it was it didn't seem to wear off so fast with Fenny. I was all for suing the CIA, but a lawyer friend of mine said it would be like trying to attack a lunatic asylum with a banana, so..." He shrugged. 
"The Vogon..." squeaked Arthur. "The yellow ships... vanished?" 
"Well, of course they did, they were hallucinations," said Russell, and looked at Arthur oddly. "You trying to say you don't remember any of this? Where have you been for heaven's sake?" 
This was, to Arthur, such an astonishingly good question that he half-leapt out of his seat with shock. 
"Christ!!!" yelled Russell, fighting to control the car which was suddenly trying to skid. He pulled it out of the path of an oncoming lorry and swerved up on to a grass bank. As the car lurched to a halt, 
the girl in the back was thrown against Russell's seat and collapsed awkwardly. 
Arthur twisted round in horror. 
"Is she all right?" he blurted out. 
Russell swept his hands angrily back through his blow-dried hair. He tugged at his blond moustache. He turned to Arthur. 
"Would you please," he said, "let go of the handbrake?" 
Chapter 6 
From here it was a four-mile walk to his village: a further mile to the turning, to which the abominable Russell had now fiercely declined to take him, and from there a further three miles of winding country lane. 
The Saab seethed off into the night. Arthur watched it go, as stunned as a man might be who, having believed himself to be totally blind for five years, suddenly discovers that he had merely been wearing too large a hat. 
He shook his head sharply in the hope that it might dislodge some salient fact which would fall into place and make sense of an otherwise utterly bewildering Universe, but since the salient fact, if there was one, entirely failed to do this, he set off up the road again, hoping that a good vigorous walk, and maybe even some good painful blisters, would help to reassure him of his own existence at least, if not his sanity. 
It was 10.30 when he arrived, a fact he discovered from the steamed and greasy window of the Horse and Groom pub, in which there had hung for many years a battered old Guiness clock which featured a picture of an emu with a pint glass jammed rather amusingly down its throat. 
This was the pub at which he had passed the fateful lunchtime during which first his house and then the entire planet Earth had been demolished, or rather had seemed to be demolished. No, damn it, had been demolished, because if it hadn't then where the bloody heck had he been for the last eight years, and how he had got there if not in one of the big yellow Vogon ships which the appalling Russell had just been telling him were merely drug-induced hallucinations, and yet if it had been demolished, what was he currently standing on...? 
He jammed the brake on this line of thought because it wasn't going to get him any further than it had the last twenty times he'd been over it. 
He started again. 
This was the pub at which he had passed the fateful lunchtime during which whatever it was had happened that he was going to sort out later had happened, and... 
It still didn't make sense. He started again.â¨This was the pub in which... This was a pub. 
Pubs served drinks and he couldn't half do with one. 
Satisfied that his jumbled thought processes had at last arrived at a conclusion, and a conclusion he was happy with, even if it wasn't the one he had set out to achieve, he strode towards the door. 
And stopped. 
A small black wire-haired terrier ran out from behind a low wall and then, catching sight of Arthur, began to snarl. 
Now Arthur knew this dog, and he knew it well. It belonged to an advertising friend of his, and was called Know-Nothing-Bozo because the way its hair stood up on its head it reminded people of the President of the United States, and the dog knew Arthur, or at least should do. It was a stupid dog, could not even read an autocue, which way why some people had protested about its name, but it should at least have been able to recognize Arthur instead of standing there, hackles raised, as if Arthur was the most fearful apparition ever to intrude upon its feeble-witted life. 
This prompted Arthur to go and peer at the window again, this time with an eye not for the asphyxiating emu but for himself. 
Seeing himself for the first time suddenly in a familiar context, he had to admit that the dog had a point. 
He looked a lot like something a farmer would use to scare birds with, and there was no doubt but that to go into the pub in his present condition would excite comments of a raucous kind, and worse still, there would doubtless be several people in there at the moment whom he knew, all of whom would be bound to bombard 
him with questions which, at the moment, he felt ill-equipped to deal with. 
Will Smithers, for instance, the owner of Know-Nothing-Bozo the Non-Wonder Dog, an animal so stupid that it had been sacked from one of Will's own commercials for being incapable of knowing which dog food it was supposed to prefer, despite the fact that the meat in all the other bowls had had engine oil poured over it. 
Will would definitely be in there. Here was his dog, here was his car, a grey Porsche 928S with a sign in the back window which read, "My other car is also a Porsche." Damn him. 
He stared at it and realized that he had just learned something he hadn't known before. 
Will Smithers, like most of the overpaid and under-scrupulous bastards Arthur knew in advertising made a point of changing his car every August so that he could tell people his accountant made him do it, though the truth was that his accountant was trying like hell to stop him, what with all the alimony he had to pay, and so on and this was the same car Arthur remembered him having before. The number plate proclaimed its year. 
Given that it was now winter, and that the event which had caused Arthur so much trouble eight of his personal years ago had occurred at the beginning of September, less than six or seven months could have passed here. 
He stood terribly still for a moment and let Know-Nothing-Bozo jump up and down yapping at him. He was suddenly stunned by a realization he could no longer avoid, which was this: he was now an alien on his own world. Try as he might, no one was even to be able to believe his story. Not only did it sound perfectly potty, but it was flatly contradicted by the simplest observable facts. 
Was this really the Earth? Was there the slightest possibility that he had made some extraordinary mistake? 
The pub in front of him was unbearably familiar to him in every detail every brick, every piece of peeling paint; and inside he could sense its familiar stuffy, noisy warmth, its exposed beams, its unauthentic cast-iron light fittings, its bar sticky with beer that people he knew had put their elbows in, overlooked by cardboard cutouts of girls with packets of peanuts stapled all over their breasts. It was all the stuff of his home, his world. 
He even knew this blasted dog. 
"Hey, Know-Nothing!" 
The sound of Will Smithers' voice meant he had to decide what do to quickly. If he stood his ground he would be discovered and the whole circus would begin. To hide would only postpone the moment, and it was bitterly cold now. 
The fact that it was Will made the choice easier. It wasn't that Arthur disliked him as such-Will was quite fun. It was just that he was fun in such an exhausting way because, being in advertising, he always wanted you to know how much fun he was having and where he had got his jacket from. 
Mindful of this, Arthur hid behind a van. 
"Hey, Know-Nothing, what's up?" 
The door opened and Will came out, wearing a leather flying jacket that he'd got a mate of his at the Road Research Laboratory to crash a car into specially, in order to get that battered look. Know-Nothing yelped with delight and, having got the attention it wanted, was happy to forget Arthur. 
Will was with some friends, and they had a game they played with the dog. 
"Commies!" they all shouted at the dog in chorus. "Commies, commies, commies!!!" 
The dog went berserk with barking, prancing up and down, yapping its little heart out, beside itself in transports of ecstatic rage. They all laughed and cheered it on, then gradually dispersed to their various cars and disappeared into the night. 
Well that clears one thing up, thought Arthur from behind the van, this is quite definitely the planet I remember. 
Chapter 7 
His house was still there. 
How or why, he had no idea. He had decided to go and have a look while he was waiting for the pub to empty, so that he could go and ask the landlord for a bed for the night when everyone else had gone. And there it was. 
He hurriedly let himself in with the key he kept under a stone frog in the garden, because, astoundingly, the phone was ringing. 
He had heard it faintly all the way up the lane and had started to run as soon as he realized where the sound was coming from. 
The door had to be forced open because of the astonishing accumulation of junk mail on the doormat. It jammed itself stuck on what he would later discover were fourteen identical, personally addressed invitations to apply for a credit card he already had, seventeen identical threatening letters for non-payment of bills on a credit card he didn't have, thirty-three identical letters saying that he personally had been specially selected as a man of taste and discrimination who knew what he wanted and where he was going in today's sophisticated jet-setting world and would he therefore like to buy some grotty wallet, and also a dead tabby kitten. 
He rammed himself through the relatively narrow opening afforded by all this, stumbled through a pile of wine offers that no discriminating connoisseur would want to miss, slithered over a heap of beach villa holidays, blundered up the dark stairs to his bedroom and got to the phone just as it stopped ringing. 
He collapsed, panting, on to his cold, musty-smelling bed and for a few minutes stopped trying to prevent the world from spinning round his head in the way it obviously wanted to. 
When it had enjoyed its little spin and had calmed down a bit, Arthur reached out for the bedside light, not expecting it to come on. To his surprise it did. This appealed to Arthur's sense of logic. Sinceâ¨the Electricity Board cut him off without fail every time he paid his bill, 
it seemed only reasonable that they should leave him connected when he didn't. Sending them money obviously only drew attention to yourself. 
The room was much as he had left it, i.e. festeringly untidy, though the effect was muted a little by a thick layer of dust. Half-read books and magazines nestled amongst piles of half-used towels. Half pairs of socks reclined in half-drunk cups of coffee. What was once a half- eaten sandwich had now half-turned into something that Arthur entirely didn't want to know about. Bung a fork of lightning through this lot, he thought to himself, and you'd start the evolution of life all over again. 
There was only one thing in the room that was different. 
For a moment or so he couldn't see what the one thing that was different was, because it too was covered in a film of disgusting dust. Then his eyes caught it and stopped. 
It was next to a battered old television on which it was only possible to watch Open University Study Courses, because if it tried to show anything more exciting it would break down. 
It was a box. 
Arthur pushed himself up on his elbows and peered at it. 
It was a grey box, with a kind of dull lustre to it. It was a cubic grey box, just over a foot on a side. It was tied with a single grey ribbon, knotted into a neat bow on the top. 
He got up, walked over and touched it in surprise. Whatever it was clearly gift-wrapped, neatly and beautifully, and was waiting for him to open it. 
Cautiously, he picked it up and carried it back to the bed. He brushed the dust off the top and loosened the ribbon. The top of the box was a lid, with a flap tucked into the body of the box. 
He untucked it and looked into the box. In it was a glass globe, nestling in fine grey tissue paper. He drew it out, carefully. It wasn't a proper globe because it was open at the bottom, or, as Arthur realized turning it over, at the top, with a thick rim. It was a bowl. A fish bowl. 
It was made of the most wonderful glass perfectly transparent, yet with an extraordinary silver-grey quality as if crystal and slate had gone into its making. 
Arthur slowly turned it over and over in his hands. It was one of the most beautiful objects he had ever seen, but he was entirely perplexed by it. He looked into the box, but other than the tissue paper there was nothing. On the outside of the box there was nothing. 
He turned the bowl round again. It was wonderful. It was exquisite. But it was a fish bowl. 
He tapped it with his thumbnail and it rang with a deep and glorious chime which was sustained for longer than seemed possible, and when at last it faded seemed not to die away but to drift off into other worlds, as into a deep sea dream. 
Entranced, Arthur turned it round yet again, and this time the light from the dusty little bedside lamp caught it at a different angle and glittered on some fine abrasions on the fish bowl's surface. He held it up, adjusting the angle to the light, and suddenly saw clearly the finely engraved shapes of words shadowed on the glass. 
"So Long," they said, "and Thanks..." 
And that was all. He blinked, and understood nothing. 
For fully five more minutes he turned the object round and around, held it to the light at different angles, tapped it for its mesmerizing chime and pondered on the meaning of the shadowy letters but could find none. Finally he stood up, filled the bowl with water from the tap and put it back on the table next to the television. He shook the little Babel fish from his ear and dropped it, wriggling, into the bowl. He wouldn't be needing it any more, except for watching foreign movies. 
He returned to lie on his bed, and turned out the light. 
He lay still and quiet. He absorbed the enveloping darkness, slowly relaxed his limbs from end to end, eased and regulated his breathing, gradually cleared his mind of all thought, closed his eyes and was completely incapable of getting to sleep. 
The night was uneasy with rain. The rain clouds themselves had now moved on and were currently concentrating their attention on a small transport cafe just outside Bournemouth, but the sky through which they had passed had been disturbed by them and now wore a damply ruffled air, as if it didn't know what else it might not do it further provoked. 
The moon was out in a watery way. It looked like a ball of paper from the back pocket of jeans that have just come out of the washing machine, and which only time and ironing would tell if it was an old shopping list or a five pound note. 
The wind flicked about a little, like the tail of a horse that's trying to decide what sort of mood it's in tonight, and a bell somewhere chimed midnight. 
A skylight creaked open. 
It was stiff and had to be jiggled and persuaded a little because the frame was slightly rotten and the hinges had at some time in its life been rather sensibly painted over, but eventually it was open. 
A strut was found to prop it and a figure struggled out into the narrow gully between the opposing pitches of the roof. 
It stood and watched the sky in silence. 
The figure was completely unrecognizable as the wild-looking creature who had burst crazily into the cottage a little over an hour ago. Gone was the ragged threadbare dressing gown, smeared with the mud of a hundred worlds, stained with junk food condiment from a hundred grimy spaceports, gone was the tangled mane of hair, gone the long and knotted beard, flourishing ecosystem and all. 
Instead, there was Arthur Dent the smooth and casual, in corduroys and a chunky sweater. His hair was cropped and washed, his chin clean shaven. Only the eyes still said that whatever it was the Universe thought it was doing to him, he would still like it please to stop. 
They were not the same eyes with which he had last looked out at this particular scene, and the brain which interpreted the images the eyes resolved was not the same brain. There had been no surgery involved, just the continual wrenching of experience. 
The night seemed like an alive thing to him at this moment, the dark earth around him a being in which he was rooted. 
He could feel like a tingle on distant nerve ends the flood of a far river, the roll of invisible hills, the knot of heavy rainclouds parked somewhere away to the south. 
He could sense, too, the thrill of being a tree, which was something he hadn't expected. He knew that it felt good to curl your toes in the earth, but he'd never realized it could feel quite as good as that. He 
could sense an almost unseemly wave of pleasure reaching out to him all the way from the New Forest. He must try this summer, he thought, and see what having leaves felt like. 
From another direction he felt the sensation of being a sheep startled by a flying saucer, but it was virtually indistinguishable from the feeling of being a sheep startled by anything else it ever encountered, for they were creatures who learned very little on their journey through life, and would be startled to see the sun rising in the morning, and astonished by all the green stuff in the fields. 
He was surprised to find he could feel the sheep being startled by the sun that morning, and the morning before, and being startled by a clump of trees the day before that. He could go further and further back, but it got dull because all it consisted of was sheep being startled by things they'd been startled by the day before. 
He left the sheep and let his mind drift outwards sleepily in developing ripples. It felt the presence of other minds, hundreds of them, thousands in a web, some sleepy, some sleeping, some terribly excited, one fractured. 
One fractured. 
He passed it fleetingly and tried to feel for it again, but it eluded him like the other card with an apple on it in Pelmanism. He felt a spasm of excitement because he knew instinctively who it was, or at least knew who it was he wanted it to be, and once you know what it is you want to be true, instinct is a very useful device for enabling you to know that it is. 
He instinctively knew that it was Fenny and that he wanted to find her; but he could not. By straining too much for it, he could feel he was losing this strange new faculty, so he relaxed the search and let his mind wander more easily once more. 
And again, he felt the fracture. 
Again he couldn't find it. This time, whatever his instinct was busy telling him it was all right to believe, he wasn't certain that it was Fenny or perhaps it was a different fracture this time. It had the same disjointed quality but it seemed a more general feeling of fracture, deeper, not a single mind, maybe not a mind at all. It was different. 
He let his mind sink slowly and widely into the Earth, rippling, seeping, sinking. 
He was following the Earth through its days, drifting with the rhythms of its myriad pulses, seeping through the webs of its life, swelling with its tides, turning with its weight. Always the fracture kept returning, a dull disjointed distant ache. 
And now he was flying through a land of light; the light was time, the tides of it were days receding. The fracture he had sensed, the second fracture, lay in the distance before him across the land, the thickness of a single hair across the dreaming landscape of the days of Earth. 
And suddenly he was upon it. 
He danced dizzily over the edge as the dreamland dropped sheer away beneath him, a stupefying precipice into nothing, him wildly twisting, clawing at nothing, flailing in horrifying space, spinning, falling. 
Across the jagged chasm had been another land, another time, an older world, not fractured from, but hardly joined: two Earths. He woke. 
A cold breeze brushed the feverish sweat standing on his forehead. The nightmare was spent and so, he felt, was he. His shoulders dropped, he gently rubbed his eyes with the tips of his fingers. At last he was sleepy as well as very tired. As to what it meant, if it meant anything at all, he would think about it in the morning; for now he would go to bed and sleep. His own bed, his own sleep. 
He could see his house in the distance and wondered why this was. It was silhouetted against the moonlight and he recognized its rather dull blockish shape. He looked about him and noticed that he was about eighteen inches above the rose bushes of one of his neighbours, John Ainsworth. His rose bushes were carefully tended, pruned back for the winter, strapped to canes and labelled, and Arthur wondered what he was doing above them. He wondered what was holding him there, and when he discovered that nothing was holding him there he crashed awkwardly to the ground. 
He picked himself up, brushed himself down and hobbled back to his house on a sprained ankle. He undressed and toppled into bed. 
While he was asleep the phone rang again. It rang for fully fifteen minutes and caused him to turn over twice. It never, however, stood a chance of waking him up. 
Chapter 8 
Arthur awoke feeling wonderful, absolutely fabulous, refreshed, overjoyed to be home, bouncing with energy, hardly disappointed at all to discover it was the middle of February. 
He almost danced to the fridge, found the three least hairy things in it, put them on a plate and watched them intently for two minutes. Since they made no attempt to move within that time he called them breakfast and ate them. Between them they killed a virulent space disease he's picked up without knowing it in the Flargathon Gas Swamps a few days earlier, which otherwise would have killed off half the population of the Western Hemisphere, blinded the other half and driven everyone else psychotic and sterile, so the Earth was lucky there. 
He felt strong, he felt healthy. He vigorously cleared away the junk mail with a spade and then buried the cat. 
Just as he was finishing that, the phone went, but he let it ring while he maintained a moment's respectful silence. Whoever it was would ring back if it was important. 
He kicked the mud off his shoes and went back inside. 
There had been a small number of significant letters in the piles of junk some documents from the council, dated three years earlier, relating to the proposed demolition of his house, and some other letters about the setting up of a public inquiry into the whole bypass scheme in the area; there was also an old letter from Greenpeace, the ecological pressure group to which he occasionally made contributions, asking for help with their scheme to release dolphins and orcas from captivity, and some postcards from friends, vaguely complaining that he never got in touch these days. 
He collected these together and put them in a cardboard file which he marked "Things To Do". Since he was feeling so vigorous and dynamic that morning, he even added the word "Urgent!" 
He unpacked his towel and another few odd bits and pieces from the plastic bag he had acquired at the Port Brasta Mega-Market. The slogan on the side was a clever and elaborate pun in Lingua Centauri which was completely incomprehensible in any other language and therefore entirely pointless for a Duty Free Shop at a spaceport. The bag also had a hole in it so he threw it away. 
He realized with a sudden twinge that something else must have dropped out in the small spacecraft that had brought him to Earth, kindly going out of its way to drop him right beside the A303. He had lost his battered and spaceworn copy of the thing which had helped him find his way across the unbelievable wastes of space he had traversed. He had lost the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. 
Well, he told himself, this time I really won't be needing it again. 
He had some calls to make. 
He had decided how to deal with the mass of contradictions his return journey precipitated, which was that he would simply brazen it out. 
He phoned the BBC and asked to be put through to his department head. 
"Oh, hello, Arthur Dent here. Look, sorry I haven't been in for six months but I've gone mad." 
"Oh, not to worry. Thought it was probably something like that. Happens here all the time. How soon can we expect you?" 
"When do hedgehogs stop hibernating?" "Sometime in spring I think."â¨"I'll be in shortly after that."â¨"Rightyho." 
He flipped through the Yellow Pages and made a short list of numbers to try. 
"Oh hello, is that the Old Elms Hospital? Yes, I was just phoning to see if I could have a word with Fenella, er... Fenella Good Lord, silly me, I'll forget my own name next, er, Fenella isn't this ridiculous? Patient of yours, dark haired girl, came in last night..." 
"I'm afraid we don't have any patients called Fenella."â¨"Oh, don't you? I mean Fiona of course, we just call her Fen..." "I'm sorry, goodbye."â¨Click. 
Six conversations along these lines began to take their toll on his mood of vigorous, dynamic optimism, and he decided that before it deserted him entirely he would take it down to the pub and parade it a little. 
He had had the perfect idea for explaining away every inexplicable weirdness about himself at a stroke, and he whistled to himself as he pushed open the door which had so daunted him last night. 
"Arthur!!!!" 
He grinned cheerfully at the boggling eyes that stared at him from all corners of the pub, and told them all what a wonderful time he'd had in Southern California. 
Chapter 9 
He accepted another pint and took a pull at it.â¨"Of course, I had my own personal alchemist too." "You what?" 
He was getting silly and he knew it. Exuberance and Hall and Woodhouse best bitter was a mixture to be wary of, but one of the first effects it had is to stop you being wary of things, and the point at which Arthur should have stopped and explained no more was the point at which he started instead to get inventive. 
"Oh yes," he insisted with a happy glazed smile. "It's why I've lost so much weight." 
"What?" said his audience. 
"Oh yes," he said again. "The Californians have rediscovered alchemy. Oh yes." 
He smiled again. 
"Only," he said, "it's in a much more useful form than that which in..." He paused thoughtfully to let a little grammar assemble in his head. "In which the ancients used to practise it. Or at least," he added, "failed to practise it. They couldn't get it to work you know. Nostradamus and that lot. Couldn't cut it." 
"Nostradamus?" said one of his audience.â¨"I didn't think he was an alchemist," said another. "I thought," said a third, "he was a seer." 
"He became a seer," said Arthur to his audience, the component parts of which were beginning to bob and blur a little, "because he was such a lousy alchemist. You should know that." 
He took another pull at his beer. It was something he had not tasted for eight years. He tasted it and tasted it. 
"What has alchemy got to do," asked a bit of the audience, "with losing weight?" 
"I'm glad you asked that," said Arthur. "Very glad. And I will now tell you what the connection is between..." He paused. "Between those two things. The things you mentioned. I'll tell you." 
He paused and manoeuvred his thoughts. It was like watching oil tankers doing three-point turns in the English Channel. 
"They've discovered how to turn excess body fat into gold," he said, in a sudden blur of coherence. 
"You're kidding." 
"Oh yes," he said, "no," he corrected himself, "they have." 
He rounded on the doubting part of his audience, which was all of it, and so it took a little while to round on it completely. 
"Have you been to California?" he demanded. "Do you know the sort of stuff they do there?" 
Three members of his audience said they had and that he was talking nonsense. 
"You haven't seen anything," insisted Arthur. "Oh yes," he added, because someone was offering to buy another round. 
"The evidence," he said, pointing at himself, and not missing by more than a couple of inches, "is before your eyes. Fourteen hours in a trance," he said, "in a tank. In a trance. I was in a tank. I think," he added after a thoughtful pause, "I already said that." 
He waited patiently while the next round was duly distributed. He composed the next bit of his story in his mind, which was going to be something about the tank needing to be orientated along a line dropped perpendicularly from the Pole Star to a baseline drawn between Mars and Venus, and was about to start trying to say it when he decided to give it a miss. 
"Long time," he said instead, "in a tank. In a trance." He looked round severely at his audience, to make sure it was all following attentively. 
He resumed.â¨"Where was I?" he said. "In a trance," said one. "In a tank," said another. 
"Oh yes," said Arthur. "Thank you. And slowly," he said pressing onwards, "slowly, slowly, all your excess body fat... turns... to..." he 
paused for effect, "subcoo... subyoo... subtoocay..." he paused for breath "subcutaneous gold, which you can have surgically removed. Getting out of the tank is hell. What did you say?" 
"I was just clearing my throat." 
"I think you doubt me." 
"I was clearing my throat." 
"She was clearing her throat," confirmed a significant part of the audience in a low rumble. 
"Oh yes," said Arthur, "all right. And you then split the proceeds..." he paused again for a maths break, "fifty-fifty with the alchemist. Make a lot of money!" 
He looked swayingly around at his audience, and could not help but be aware of an air of scepticism about their jumbled faces. 
He felt very affronted by this. 
"How else," he demanded, "could I afford to have my face dropped?" 
Friendly arms began to help him home. "Listen," he protested, as the cold February breeze brushed his face, "looking lived-in is all the rage in California at the moment. You've got to look as if you've seen the Galaxy. Life, I mean. You've got to look as if you've seen life. That's what I got. A face drop. Give me eight years, I said. I hope being thirty doesn't come back into fashion or I've wasted a lot of money." 
He lapsed into silence for a while as the friendly arms continued to help him along the lane to his house. 
"Got in yesterday," he mumbled. "I'm very happy to be home. Or somewhere very like it..." 
"Jet lag," muttered one of his friends. "Long trip from California. Really mucks you up for a couple of days." 
"I don't think he's been there at all," muttered another. "I wonder where he has been. And what's happened to him." 
After a little sleep Arthur got up and pottered round the house a bit. He felt woozy and a little low, still disoriented by the journey. He wondered how he was going to find Fenny. 
He sat and looked at the fish bowl. He tapped it again, and despite being full of water and a small yellow Babel fish which was gulping its 
way around rather dejectedly, it still chimed its deep and resonant chime as clearly and mesmerically as before. 
Someone is trying to thank me, he thought to himself. He wondered who, and for what. 
Chapter 10 
"At the third stroke it will be one... thirty-two... and twenty seconds. 
"Beep... beep... beep." 
Ford Prefect suppressed a little giggle of evil satisfaction, realized that he had no reason to suppress it, and laughed out loud, a wicked laugh. 
He switched the incoming signal through from the Sub-Etha Net to the ship's hi-fi system, and the odd, rather stilted, sing-song voice spoke out with remarkable clarity round the cabin. 
"At the third stroke it will be one... thirty-two... and thirty seconds. 
"Beep... beep... beep." 
He tweaked the volume up just a little while keeping a careful eye on a rapidly changing table of figures on the ship's computer display. For the length of time he had in mind, the question of power consumption became significant. He didn't want a murder on his conscience. 
"At the third stroke it will be one... thirty-two... and forty seconds. 
"Beep... beep... beep." 
He checked around the small ship. He walked down the short corridor. "At the third stroke..." 
He stuck his head into the small, functional, gleaming steel bathroom. 
"it will be..." 
It sounded fine in there. 
He looked into the tiny sleeping quarters. 
"... one... thirty-two..." 
It sounded a bit muffled. There was a towel hanging over one of the speakers. He took down the towel. 
"... and fifty seconds." 
Fine. 
He checked out the packed cargo hold, and wasn't at all satisfied with the sound. There was altogether too much crated junk in the way. He stepped back out and waited for the door to seal. He broke open a closed control panel and pushed the jettison button. He didn't know why he hadn't thought of that before. A whooshing rumbling noise died away quickly into silence. After a pause a slight hiss could be heard again. 
It stopped. 
He waited for the green light to show and then opened the door again on the now empty cargo hold. 
"... one... thirty-three... and fifty seconds." Very nice.â¨"Beep... beep... beep." 
He then went and had a last thorough examination of the emergency suspended animation chamber, which was where he particularly wanted it to be heard. 
"At the third stroke it will be one... thirty... four... precisely." 
He shivered as he peered down through the heavily frosted covering at the dim bulk of the form within. One day, who knew when, it would wake, and when it did, it would know what time it was. Not exactly local time, true, but what the heck. 
He double-checked the computer display above the freezer bed, dimmed the lights and checked it again. 
"At the third stroke it will be..." 
He tiptoed out and returned to the control cabin. 
"... one... thirty-four and twenty seconds." 
The voice sounded as clear as if he was hearing it over a phone in London, which he wasn't, not by a long way. 
He gazed out into the inky night. The star the size of a brilliant biscuit crumb he could see in the distance was Zondostina, or as it was known on the world from which the rather stilted, sing-song voice was being received, Pleiades Zeta. 
The bright orange curve that filled over half the visible area was the giant gas planet Sesefras Magna, where the Xaxisian battleships 
docked, and just rising over its horizon was a small cool blue moon, Epun. 
"At the third stroke it will be..." 
For twenty minutes he sat and watched as the gap between the ship and Epun closed, as the ship's computer teased and kneaded the numbers that would bring it into a loop around the little moon, close the loop and keep it there, orbiting in perpetual obscurity. 
"One... fifty-nine..." 
His original plan had been to close down all external signalling and radiation from the ship, to render it as nearly invisible as possible unless you were actually looking at it, but then he'd had an idea he preferred. It would now emit one single continuous beam, pencil-thin, broadcasting the incoming time signal to the planet of the signal's origin, which it would not reach for four hundred years, travelling at light speed, but where it would probably cause something of a stir when it did. 
"Beep... beep... beep." 
He sniggered. 
He didn't like to think of himself as the sort of person who giggled or sniggered, but he had to admit that he had been giggling and sniggering almost continuously for well over half an hour now. 
"At the third stroke..." 
The ship was now locked almost perfectly into its perpetual orbit round a little known and never visited moon. Almost perfect. 
One thing only remained. He ran again the computer simulation of the launching of the ship's little Escape-O-Buggy, balancing actions, reactions, tangential forces, all the mathematical poetry of motion, and saw that it was good. 
Before he left, he turned out the lights. 
As his tiny little cigar tube of an escape craft zipped out on the beginning of its three-day journey to the orbiting space station Port Sesefron, it rode for a few seconds a long pencil-thin beam of radiation that was starting out on a longer journey still. 
"At the third stroke, it will be two... thirteen... and fifty seconds." 
He giggled and sniggered. He would have laughed out loud but he didn't have the room. 
"Beep... beep... beep." 
Chapter 11 
"April showers I hate especially." 
However noncommittally Arthur grunted, the man seemed determined to talk to him. He wondered if he should get up and move to another table, but there didn't seem to be one free in the whole cafeteria. He stirred his coffee fiercely. 
"Bloody April showers. Hate hate hate." 
Arthur stared, frowning, out of the window. A light, sunny spray of rain hung over the motorway. Two months he'd been back now. Slipping back into his old life had in fact been laughably easy. People had such extraordinarily short memories, including him. Eight years of crazed wanderings round the Galaxy now seemed to him not so much like a bad dream as like a film he had videotaped from the tv and now kept in the back of a cupboard without bothering to watch. 
One effect that still lingered though, was his joy at being back. Now that the Earth's atmosphere had closed over his head for good, he thought, wrongly, everything within it gave him extraordinary pleasure. Looking at the silvery sparkle of the raindrops he felt he had to protest. 
"Well, I like them," he said suddenly, "and for all the obvious reasons. They're light and refreshing. They sparkle and make you feel good." 
The man snorted derisively. 
"That's what they all say," he said, and glowered darkly from his corner seat. 
He was a lorry driver. Arthur knew this because his opening, unprovoked remark had been, "I'm a lorry driver. I hate driving in the rain. Ironic isn't it? Bloody ironic." 
If there was a sequitur hidden in this remark, Arthur had not been able to divine it and had merely given a little grunt, affable but not encouraging. 
But the man had not been deterred then, and was not deterred now. "They all say that about bloody April showers," he said. "So bloody nice, so bloody refreshing, such charming bloody weather." 
He leaned forward, screwing his face up as if he was going to say something about the government. 
"What I want to know is this," he said, "if it's going to be nice weather, why," he almost spat, "can't it be nice without bloody raining?" 
Arthur gave up. He decided to leave his coffee, which was too hot to drink quickly and too nasty to drink cold. 
"Well, there you go," he said and instead got up himself. "Bye." 
He stopped off at the service station shop, then walked back through the car park, making a point of enjoying the fine play of rain on his face. There was even, he noticed, a faint rainbow glistening over the Devon hills. He enjoyed that too. 
He climbed into his battered but adored old black Golf GTi, squealed the tyres, and headed out past the islands of petrol pumps and on to the slip road back towards the motorway. 
He was wrong in thinking that the atmosphere of the Earth had closed finally and for ever above his head. 
He was wrong to think that it would ever be possible to put behind him the tangled web of irresolutions into which his galactic travels had dragged him. 
He was wrong to think he could now forget that the big, hard, oily, dirty, rainbow-hung Earth on which he lived was a microscopic dot on a microscopic dot lost in the unimaginable infinity of the Universe. 
He drove on, humming, being wrong about all these things. 
The reason he was wrong was standing by the slip road under a small umbrella. 
His jaw sagged. He sprained his ankle against the brake pedal and skidded so hard he very nearly turned the car over. 
"Fenny!" he shouted. 
Having narrowly avoided hitting her with the actual car, he hit her instead with the car door as he leant across and flung it open at her. 
It caught her hand and knocked away her umbrella, which then bowled wildly away across the road. 
"Shit!" yelled Arthur as helpfully as he cold, leapt out of his own door, narrowly avoided being run down by McKeena's All-Weather Haulage, and watched in horror as it ran down Fenny's umbrella instead. The lorry swept along the motorway and away. 
The umbrella lay like a recently swatted daddy-long-legs, expiring sadly on the ground. Tiny gusts of wind made it twitch a little. 
He picked it up. 
"Er," he said. There didn't seem to be a lot of point in offering the thing back to her. 
"How did you know my name?" she said.â¨"Er, well," he said. "Look, I'll get you another one..." He looked at her and tailed off. 
She was tallish with dark hair which fell in waves around a pale and serious face. Standing still, alone, she seemed almost sombre, like a statue to some important but unpopular virtue in a formal garden. She seemed to be looking at something other than what she looked as if she was looking at. 
But when she smiled, as she did now, it was as if she suddenly arrived from somewhere. Warmth and life flooded into her face, and impossibly graceful movement into her body. The effect was very disconcerting, and it disconcerted Arthur like hell. 
She grinned, tossed her bag into the back and swivelled herself into the front seat. 
"Don't worry about the umbrella," she said to him as she climbed in. "It was my brother's and he can't have liked it or he wouldn't have given it to me." She laughed and pulled on her seatbelt. "You're not a friend of my brother's are you?" 
"No." 
Her voice was the only part of her which didn't say "Good". 
Her physical presence there in the car, his car, was quite extraordinary to Arthur. He felt, as he let the car pull slowly away, that he could hardly think or breathe, and hoped that neither of these functions were vital to his driving or they were in trouble. 
So what he had experienced in the other car, her brother's car, the night he had returned exhausted and bewildered from his nightmare years in the stars had not been the unbalance of the moment, or, if it had been, he was at least twice as unbalanced now, and quite liable 
to fall off whatever it is that well-balanced people are supposed to be balancing on. 
"So..." he said, hoping to kick the conversation off to an exciting start. 
"He was meant to pick me up my brother but phoned to say he couldn't make it. I asked about buses but the man started to look at the calendar rather than a timetable, so I decided to hitch. So." 
"So." 
"So here I am. And what I would like to know, is how you know my name." 
"Perhaps we ought to first sort out," said Arthur, looking back over his shoulder as he eased his car into the motorway traffic, "where I'm taking you." 
Very close, he hoped, or long away. Close would mean she lived near him, a long way would mean he could drive her there. 
"I'd like to go to Taunton," she said, "please. If that's all right. It's not far. You can drop me at..." 
"You live in Taunton?" he said, hoping that he'd managed to sound merely curious rather than ecstatic. Taunton was wonderfully close to him. He could... 
"No, London," she said. "There's a train in just under an hour." 
It was the worst thing possible. Taunton was only minutes away up the motorway. He wondered what to do, and while he was wondering with horror heard himself saying, "Oh, I can take you to London. Let me take you to London..." 
Bungling idiot. Why on Earth had he said "let" in that stupid way? He was behaving like a twelve-year-old. 
"Are you going to London?" she asked. 
"I wasn't," he said, "but..." Bungling idiot. 
"It's very kind of you," she said, "but really no. I like to go by train." And suddenly she was gone. Or rather, that part of her which brought her to life was gone. She looked rather distantly out of the window and hummed lightly to herself. 
He couldn't believe it.â¨Thirty seconds into the conversation, and already he'd blown it. 
Grown men, he told himself, in flat contradiction of centuries of accumulated evidence about the way grown men behave, do not behave like this. 
Taunton 5 miles, said the signpost. 
He gripped the steering wheel so tightly the car wobbled. He was going to have to do something dramatic. 
"Fenny," he said. 
She glanced round sharply at him. 
"You still haven't told me how..." 
"Listen," said Arthur, "I will tell you, though the story is rather strange. Very strange." 
She was still looking at him, but said nothing. "Listen..."â¨"You said that." 
"Did I? Oh. There are things I must talk to you about, and things I must tell you... a story I must tell you which would..." He was thrashing about. He wanted something along the lines of "Thy knotted and combined locks to part, and each particular quill to stand on end like quills upon the fretful porpentine" but didn't think he could carry it off and didn't like the hedgehog reference. 
"... which would take more than five miles," he settled for in the end, rather lamely he was afraid. 
"Well..." 
"Just supposing," he said, "just supposing" he didn't know what was coming next, so he thought he'd just sit back and listen "that there was some extraordinary way in which you were very important to me, and that, though you didn't know it, I was very important to you, but it all went for nothing because we only had five miles and I was a stupid idiot at knowing how to say something very important to someone I've only just met and not crash into lorries at the same time, what would you say..." he paused helplessly, and looked at her, "I... should do?" 
"Watch the road!" she yelped. 
"Shit!" 
He narrowly avoided careering into the side of a hundred Italian washing machines in a German lorry. 
"I think," she said, with a momentary sigh of relief, "you should buy me a drink before my train goes." 
Chapter 12 
There is, for some reason, something especially grim about pubs near stations, a very particular kind of grubbiness, a special kind of pallor to the pork pies. 
Worse than the pork pies, though, are the sandwiches. 
There is a feeling which persists in England that making a sandwich interesting, attractive, or in any way pleasant to eat is something sinful that only foreigners do. 
"Make 'em dry," is the instruction buried somewhere in the collective national consciousness, "make 'em rubbery. If you have to keep the buggers fresh, do it by washing 'em once a week." 
It is by eating sandwiches in pubs on Saturday lunchtimes that the British seek to atone for whatever their national sins have been. They're not altogether clear what those sins are, and don't want to know either. Sins are not the sort of things one wants to know about. But whatever their sins are they are amply atoned for by the sandwiches they make themselves eat. 
If there is anything worse than the sandwiches, it is the sausages which sit next to them. Joyless tubes, full of gristle, floating in a sea of something hot and sad, stuck with a plastic pin in the shape of a chef's hat: a memorial, one feels, for some chef who hated the world, and died, forgotten and alone among his cats on a back stair in Stepney. 
The sausages are for the ones who know what their sins are and wish to atone for something specific. 
"There must be somewhere better," said Arthur. 
"No time," said Fenny, glancing at her watch. "My train leaves in half an hour." 
They sat at a small wobbly table. On it were some dirty glasses, and some soggy beermats with jokes printed on them. Arthur got Fenny a tomato juice, and himself a pint of yellow water with gas in it. And a couple of sausages. He didn't know why. He bought them for something to do while the gas settled in his glass. 
The barman dunked Arthur's change in a pool of beer on the bar, for which Arthur thanked him. 
"All right," said Fenny, glancing at her watch, "tell me what it is you have to tell me." 
She sounded, as well she might, extremely sceptical, and Arthur's heart sank. Hardly, he felt, the most conductive setting to try to explain to her as she sat there, suddenly cool and defensive, that in a sort of out-of-body dream he had had a telepathic sense that the mental breakdown she had suffered had been connected with the fact that, appearances to the contrary nonwithstanding, the Earth had been demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass, something which he alone on Earth knew anything about, having virtually witnessed it from a Vogon spaceship, and that furthermore both his body and soul ached for her unbearably and he needed to got to bed with her as soon as was humanly possible. 
"Fenny," he started. 
"I wonder if you'd like to buy some tickets for our raffle? It's just a little one." 
He glanced up sharply.â¨"To raise money for Anjie who's retiring." "What?"â¨"And needs a kidney machine." 
He was being leant over by a rather stiffly slim middle-aged woman with a prim knitted suit and a prim little perm, and a prim little smile that probably got licked by prim little dogs a lot. 
She was holding out a small book of cloakroom tickets and a collecting tin. 
"Only ten pence each," she said, "so you could probably even buy two. Without breaking the bank!" She gave a tinkly little laugh and then a curiously long sigh. Saying "Without breaking the bank" had obviously given her more pleasure than anything since some GIs had been billeted on her in the war. 
"Er, yes, all right," said Arthur, hurriedly digging in his pocket and producing a couple of coins. 
With infuriating slowness, and prim theatricality, if there was such a thing, the woman tore off two tickets and handed them to Arthur. 
"I do hope you win," she said with a smile that suddenly snapped together like a piece of advanced origami, "the prizes are so nice." 
"Yes, thank you," said Arthur, pocketing the tickets rather brusquely and glancing at his watch. 
He turned towards Fenny. 
So did the woman with the raffle tickets. 
"And what about you, young lady?" she said. "It's for Anjie's kidney machine. She's retiring you see. Yes?" She hoisted the little smile even further up her face. She would have to stop and let it go soon or the skin would surely split. 
"Er, look, here you are," said Arthur, and pushed a fifty pence piece at her in the hope that that would see her off. 
"Oh, we are in the money, aren't we?" said the woman, with a long smiling sigh. "Down from London are we?" 
"No, that's all right, really," he said with a wave of his hand, and she started with an awful deliberation to peel off five tickets, one by one. 
"Oh, but you must have your tickets," insisted the woman, "or you won't be able to claim your prize. They're very nice prizes, you know. Very suitable." 
Arthur snatched the tickets, and said thank you as sharply as he could. 
The woman turned to Fenny once again. 
"And now, what about..." 
"No!" Arthur nearly yelled. "These are for her," he explained, brandishing the five new tickets. 
"Oh, I see! How nice!"â¨She smiled sickeningly at both of them. "Well, I do hope you..."â¨"Yes," snapped Arthur, "thank you." 
The woman finally departed to the table next to theirs. Arthur turned desperately to Fenny, and was relieved to see that she was rocking with silent laughter. 
He sighed and smiled.â¨"Where were we?"â¨"You were calling me Fenny, and I was about to ask you not to." 
"What do you mean?" 
She twirled the little wooden cocktail stick in her tomato juice. 
"It's why I asked if you were a friend of my brother's. Or half- brother really. He's the only one who calls me Fenny, and I'm not fond of him for it." 
"So what's...?" "Fenchurch."â¨"What?"â¨"Fenchurch." "Fenchurch."â¨She looked at him sternly. 
"Yes," she said, "and I'm watching you like a lynx to see if you're going to ask the same silly question that everybody asks me until I want to scream. I shall be cross and disappointed if you do. Plus I shall scream. So watch it." 
She smiled, shook her hair a little forward over her face and peered at him from behind it. 
"Oh," he said, "that's a little unfair, isn't it?" 
"Yes." 
"Fine." 
"All right," she said with a laugh, "you can ask me. Might as well get it over with. Better than have you call me Fenny all the time." 
"Presumably..." said Arthur. 
"We've only got two tickets left, you see, and since you were so generous when I spoke to you before..." 
"What?" snapped Arthur. 
The woman with the perm and the smile and the now nearly empty book of cloakroom tickets was now waving the two last ones under his nose. 
"I thought I'd give the opportunity to you, because the prizes are so nice." 
She wrinkled up he nose a little confidentially. 
"Very tasteful. I know you'll like them. And it is for Anjie's retirement present you see. We want to give her..." 
"A kidney machine, yes," said Arthur. "Here." 
He held out two more ten pence pieces to her, and took the tickets. 
A thought seemed to strike the woman. It struck her very slowly. You could watch it coming in like a long wave on a sandy beach. 
"Oh dear," she said, "I'm not interrupting anything am I?" 
She peered anxiously at both of them. 
"No it's fine," said Arthur. Everything that could possibly be fine," he insisted, "is fine. 
"Thank you," he added. 
"I say," she said, in a delightful ecstacy of worry, "you're not ... in love, are you?" 
"It's very hard to say," said Arthur. "We haven't had a chance to talk yet." 
He glanced at Fenchurch. She was grinning. 
The woman nodded with knowing confidentiality. 
"I'll let you see the prizes in a minute," she said, and left. 
Arthur turned, with a sigh, back to the girl that he found it hard to say whether he was in love with. 
"You were about to ask me," she said, "a question." 
"Yes," said Arthur. 
"We can do it together if you like," said Fenchurch. "Was I found ..." 
"... in a handbag..." joined in Arthur.â¨"... in the Left Luggage Office..." they said together. "... at Fenchurch street station," they finished. "And the answer," said Fenchurch, "is no."â¨"Fine," said Arthur.â¨"I was conceived there."â¨"What?"â¨"I was con "â¨"In the Left Luggage Office?" hooted Arthur. 
"No, of course not. Don't be silly. What would my parents be doing in the Left Luggage Office?" she said, rather taken aback by the suggestion. 
"Well, I don't know," spluttered Arthur, "or rather..." "It was in the ticket queue." 
"The..." 
"The ticket queue. Or so they claim. They refuse to elaborate. They only say you wouldn't believe how bored it is possible to get in the ticket queue at Fenchurch Street Station." 
She sipped demurely at her tomato juice and looked at her watch. 
Arthur continued to gurgle for a moment or two. 
"I'm going to have to go in a minute or two," said Fenchurch, "and you haven't begun to tell me whatever this terrifically extraordinary thing is that you were so keen to get off your chest." 
"Why don't you let me drive you to London?" said Arthur. "It's Saturday, I've got nothing particular to do, I'd..." 
"No," said Fenchurch, "thank you, it's sweet of you, but no. I need to be by myself for a couple of days." She smiled and shrugged. 
"But..." 
"You can tell me another time. I'll give you my number." 
Arthur's heart went boom boom churn churn as she scribbled seven figures in pencil on a scrap of paper and handed it to him. 
"Now we can relax," she said with a slow smile which filled Arthur till he thought he would burst. 
"Fenchurch," he said, enjoying the name as he said it. "I " 
"A box," said a trailing voice, "of cherry liqueurs, and also, and I know you'll like this, a gramophone record of Scottish bagpipe music..." 
"Yes thank you, very nice," insisted Arthur. 
"I just thought I'd let you have a look at them," said the permed woman, "as you're down from London..." 
She was holding them out proudly for Arthur too see. He could see that they were indeed a box of cherry brandy liqueurs and a record of bagpipe music. That was what they were. 
"I'll let you have your drink in peace now," she said, patting Arthur lightly on his seething shoulder, "but I knew you'd like to see." 
Arthur re-engaged his eyes with Fenchurch's once again, and suddenly was at a loss for something to say. A moment had come and gone between the two of them, but the whole rhythm of it had been wrecked by that stupid, blasted woman. 
"Don't worry," said Fenchurch, looking at him steadily from over the top of her glass, "we will talk again." She took a sip. 
"Perhaps," she added, "it wouldn't have gone so well if it wasn't for her." She gave a wry little smile and dropped her hair forward over her face again. 
It was perfectly true.â¨He had to admit it was perfectly true. 
Chapter 13 
That night, at home, as he was prancing round the house pretending to be tripping through cornfields in slow motion and continually exploding with sudden laughter, Arthur thought he could even bear to listen to the album of bagpipe music he had won. It was eight o'clock and he decided he would make himself, force himself, to listen to the whole record before he phoned her. Maybe he should even leave it till tomorrow. That would be the cool thing to do. Or next week sometime. 
No. No games. He wanted her and didn't care who knew it. He definitely and absolutely wanted her, adored her, longed for her, wanted to do more things than there were names for with her. 
He actually caught himself saying thinks like "Yippee" as he prances ridiculously round the house. Her eyes, her hair, her voice, everything... 
He stopped. 
He would put on the record of bagpipe music. Then he would call her. 
Would he, perhaps, call her first? 
No. What he would do was this. He would put on the record of bagpipe music. He would listen to it, every last banshee wail of it. Then he would call her. That was the correct order. That was what he would do. 
He was worried about touching things in case they blew up when he did so. 
He picked up the record. It failed to blow up. He slipped it out of its cover. He opened the record player, he turned on the amp. They both survived. He giggled foolishly as he lowered the stylus on to the disc. 
He sat and listened solemnly to "A Scottish Soldier". He listened to "Amazing Grace".â¨He listened to something about some glen or other. 
He thought about his miraculous lunchtime. 
They had just been on the point of leaving, when they were distracted by an awful outbreak of "yoo-hooing". The appallingly permed woman was waving to them across the room like some stupid bird with a broken wing. Everyone in the pub turned to them and seemed to be expecting some sort of response. 
They hadn't listened to the bit about how pleased and happy Anjie was going to be about the 4.30p everyone had helped to raiseâ¨towards the cost of her kidney machine, had been vaguely aware that someone from the next table had won a box of cherry brandy liqueurs, and took a moment or two to cotton on to the fact that the yoo- hooing lady was trying to ask them if they had ticket number 37. 
Arthur discovered that he had. He glanced angrily at his watch. 
Fenchurch gave him a push. 
"Go on," she said, "go and get it. Don't be bad tempered. Give them a nice speech about how pleased you are and you can give me a call and tell me how it went. I'll want to hear the record. Go on." 
She flicked his arm and left. 
The regulars thought his acceptance speech a little over-effusive. It was, after all, merely an album of bagpipe music. 
Arthur thought about it, and listened to the music, and kept on breaking into laughter. 
Chapter 14 
Ring ring. 
Ring ring. 
Ring ring. 
"Hello, yes? Yes, that's right. Yes. You'll 'ave to speak up, there's an awful lot of noise in 'ere. What? 
"No, I only do the bar in the evenings. It's Yvonne who does lunch, and Jim, he's the landlord. No, I wasn't on. What? 
"You'll have to speak up. 
"What? No, don't know anything about no raffle. What? 
"No, don't know nothing about it. 'Old on, I'll call Jim." 
The barmaid put her hand over the receiver and called over the noisy bar. 
"'Ere, Jim, bloke on the phone says something about he's won a raffle. He keeps on saying it's ticket 37 and he's won." 
"No, there was a guy in the pub here won," shouted back the barman. 
"He says 'ave we got the ticket." 
"Well how can he think he's won if he hasn't even got a ticket?" 
"Jim says 'ow can you think you've won if you 'aven't even got the ticket. What?" 
She put her hand over the receiver again. 
"Jim, 'e keeps effing and blinding at me. Says there's a number on the ticket." 
"Course there was a number on the ticket, it was a bloody raffle ticket wasn't it?" 
"'E says 'e means its a telephone number on the ticket."â¨"Put the phone down and serve the bloody customers, will you?" 
Chapter 15 
Eight hours West sat a man alone on a beach mourning an inexplicable loss. He could only think of his loss in little packets of grief at a time, because the whole thing was too great to be borne. 
He watched the long slow Pacific waves come in along the sand, and waited and waited for the nothing that he knew was about to happen. As the time came for it not to happen, it duly didn't happen and so the afternoon wore itself away and the sun dropped beneath the long line of sea, and the day was gone. 
The beach was a beach we shall not name, because his private house was there, but it was a small sandy stretch somewhere along the hundreds of miles of coastline that first runs west from Los Angeles, which is described in the new edition of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy in one entry as "junky, wunky, lunky, stunky, and what's that other word, and all kinds of bad stuff, woo", and in another, written only hours later as "being like several thousand square miles of American Express junk mail, but without the same sense of moral depth. Plus the air is, for some reason, yellow." 
The coastline runs west, and then turns north up to the misty bay of San Francisco, which the Guide describes as a "good place to go. It's very easy to believe that everyone you meet there is also a space traveller. Starting a new religion for you is just their way of saying 'hi'. Until you've settled in and got the hang of the place it is best to say 'no' to three questions out of any given four that anyone may ask you, because there are some very strange things going on there, some of which an unsuspecting alien could die of." The hundreds of curling miles of cliffs and sand, palm trees, breakers and sunsets are described in the Guide as "Boffo. A good one." 
And somewhere on this good boffo stretch of coastline lay the house of this inconsolable man, a man whom many regarded as being insane. But this was only, as he would tell people, because he was. 
One of the many reasons why people thought him insane was because of the peculiarity of his house which, even in a land where most people's houses were peculiar in one way or another, was quite extreme in his peculiarness. 
His house was called The Outside of the Asylum. 
His name was simply John Watson, though he preferred to be called and some of his friends had now reluctantly agreed to this Wonko the Sane. 
In his house were a number of strange things, including a grey glass bowl with eight words engraved upon it. 
We can talk of him much later on this is just an interlude to watch the sun go down and to say that he was there watching it. 
He had lost everything he cared for, and was now simply waiting for the end of the world little realizing that it had already been and gone. 
Chapter 16 
After a disgusting Sunday spent emptying rubbish bins behind a pub in Taunton, and finding nothing, no raffle ticket, no telephone number, Arthur tried everything he could to find Fenchurch, and the more things he tried, the more weeks passed. 
He raged and railed against himself, against fate, against the world and its weather. He even, in his sorrow and his fury, went and sat in the motorway service station cafeteria where he'd been just before he met her. 
"It's the drizzle that makes me particularly morose." "Please shut up about the drizzle," snapped Arthur. "I would shut up if it would shut up drizzling." "Look..." 
"But I'll tell you what it will do when it shuts up drizzling, shall I?" "No."â¨"Blatter."â¨"What?" 
"It will blatter." 
Arthur stared over the rim of his coffee cup at the grisly outside world. It was a completely pointless place to be, he realized, and he had been driven there by superstition rather than logic. However, as if to bait him with the knowledge that such coincidences could in fact happen, fate had chosen to reunite him with the lorry driver he had encountered there last time. 
The more he tried to ignore him, the more he found himself being dragged back into the gravitic whirlpool of the man's exasperating conversation. 
"I think," said Arthur vaguely, cursing himself for even bothering to say this, "that it's easing off." 
"Ha!" 
Arthur just shrugged. He should go. That's what he should do. He should just go. 
"It never stops raining!" ranted the lorry driver. He thumped the table, spilt his tea, and actually, for a moment, appeared to be steaming. 
You can't just walk off without responding to a remark like that. 
"Of course it stops raining," said Arthur. It was hardly an elegant refutation, but it had to be said. 
"It rains... all... the time," raved the man, thumping the table again, in time to the words. 
Arthur shook his head. 
"Stupid to say it rains all the time..." he said. 
The man's eyebrows shot up, affronted. 
"Stupid? Why's it stupid? Why's it stupid to say it rains all the time if it rains the whole time?" 
"Didn't rain yesterday." 
"Did in Darlington." 
Arthur paused, warily. 
"You going to ask me where I was yesterday?" asked the man. "Eh?" 
"No," said Arthur.â¨"But I expect you can guess."â¨"Do you."â¨"Begins with a D."â¨"Does it."â¨"And it was pissing down there, I can tell you." 
"You don't want to sit there, mate," said a passing stranger in overalls to Arthur cheerily. "That's Thundercloud Corner that is. Reserved special for old Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head here. There's one reserved in every motorway caff between here and sunny Denmark. Steer clear is my advice. 'Swhat we all do. How's it going, Rob? Keeping busy? Got your wet-weather tyres on? Har har." 
He breezed by and went to tell a joke about Britt Ekland to someone at a nearby table. 
"See, none of them bastards take me seriously," said Rob McKeena. "But," he added darkly, leaning forward and screwing up his eyes, "they all know it's true!" 
Arthur frowned. 
"Like my wife," hissed the sole owner and driver of McKeena's All- Weather Haulage. "She says it's nonsense and I make a fuss and complain about nothing, but," he paused dramatically and darted out dangerous looks from his eyes, "she always brings the washing in when I phone to say I'm on me way home!" He brandished his coffee spoon. "What do you make of that?" 
"Well..." 
"I have a book," he went on, "I have a book. A diary. Kept it for fifteen years. Shows every single place I've ever been. Every day. And also what the weather was like. And it was uniformly," he snarled, "'orrible. All over England, Scotland, Wales I been. All round the Continent, Italy, Germany, back and forth to Denmark, been to Yugoslavia. It's all marked in and charted. Even when I went to visit my brother," he added, "in Seattle." 
"Well," said Arthur, getting up to leave at last, "perhaps you'd better show it to someone." 
"I will," said Rob McKeena. And he did. 
Chapter 17 
Misery, dejection. More misery and more dejection. He needed a project and he gave himself one. 
He would find where his cave had been. 
On prehistoric Earth he had lived in a cave, not a nice cave, a lousy cave, but... There was no but. It had been a totally lousy cave and he had hated it. But he had lived in it for five years which made it home of some kind, and a person likes to keep track of his homes. Arthur Dent was such a person and so he went to Exeter to buy a computer. 
That was what he really wanted, of course, a computer. But he felt he ought to have some serious purpose in mind before he simply went and lashed out a lot of readies on what people might otherwise mistake as being just a thing to play with. So that was his serious purpose. To pinpoint the exact location of a cave on prehistoric Earth. He explained this to the man in the shop. 
"Why?" said the man in the shop.â¨This was a tricky one.â¨"OK, skip that," said the man in the shop. "How?" "Well, I was hoping you could help me with that." The man sighed and his shoulders dropped. "Have you much experience of computers?" 
Arthur wondered whether to mention Eddie the shipboard computer on the Heart of Gold, who could have done the job in a second, or Deep Thought, or but decided he wouldn't. 
"No," he said. 
"Looks like a fun afternoon," said the man in the shop, but he said it only to himself. 
Arthur bought the Apple anyway. Over a few days he also acquired some astronomical software, plotted the movements of stars, drew rough little diagrams of how he seemed to remember the stars to have been in the sky when he looked up out of his cave at night, and 
worked away busily at it for weeks, cheerfully putting off the conclusion he knew he would inevitably have to come to, which was that the whole project was completely ludicrous. 
Rough drawings from memory were futile. He didn't even know how long it had been, beyond Ford Prefect's rough guess at the time that it was "a couple of million years" and he simply didn't have the maths. 
Still, in the end he worked out a method which would at least produce a result. He decided not to mind the fact that with the extraordinary jumble of rules of thumb, wild approximations and arcane guesswork he was using he would be lucky to hit the right galaxy, he just went ahead and got a result. 
He would call it the right result. Who would know? 
As it happened, through the myriad and unfathomable chances of fate, he got it exactly right, though he of course would never know that. He just went up to London and knocked on the appropriate door. 
"Oh. I thought you were going to phone me first." 
Arthur gaped in astonishment. 
"You can only come in for a few minutes," said Fenchurch. "I'm just going out." 
Chapter 18 
A summer's day in Islington, full of the mournful wail of antique- restoring machinery. 
Fenchurch was unavoidably busy for the afternoon, so Arthur wandered in a blissed-out haze and looked at all the shops which, in Islington, are quite an useful bunch, as anyone who regularly needs old woodworking tools, Boer War helmets, drag, office furniture or fish will readily confirm. 
The sun beat down over the roofgardens. It beat on architects and plumbers. It beat on barristers and burglars. It beat on pizzas. It beat on estate agent's particulars. 
It beat on Arthur as he went into a restored furniture shop. 
"It's an interesting building," said the proprietor, cheerfully. "There's a cellar with a secret passage which connects with a nearby pub. It was built for the Prince Regent apparently, so he could make his escape when he needed to." 
"You mean, in case anybody might catch him buying stripped pine furniture," said Arthur 
"No," said the proprietor, "not for that reason."â¨"You'll have to excuse me," said Arthur. "I'm terribly happy." "I see." 
He wandered hazily on and found himself outside the offices of Greenpeace. He remembered the contents of his file marked "Things to do-urgent!", which he hadn't opened again in the meantime. He marched in with a cheery smile and said he'd come to give them some money to help free the dolphins. 
"Very funny," they told him, "go away." 
This wasn't quite the response he had expected, so he tried again. This time they got quite angry with him, so he just left some money anyway and went back out into the sunshine. 
Just after six he returned to Fenchurch's house in the alleyway, clutching a bottle of champagne. 
"Hold this," she said, shoved a stout rope in his hand and disappeared inside through the large white wooden doors from which dangled a fat padlock off a black iron bar. 
The house was a small converted stable in a light industrial alleyway behind the derelict Royal Agricultural Hall of Islington. As well as its large stable doors it also had a normal-looking front door of smartly glazed panelled wood with a black dolphin door knocker. The one odd thing about this door was its doorstep, which was nine feet high, since the door was set into the upper of the two floors and presumably had been originally used to haul in hay for hungry horses. 
An old pulley jutted out of the brickwork above the doorway and it was over this that the rope Arthur was holding was slung. The other end of the rope held a suspended 'cello. 
The door opened above his head. 
"OK," said Fenchurch, "pull on the rope, steady the 'cello. Pass it up to me." 
He pulled on the rope, he steadied the 'cello. 
"I can't pull on the rope again," he said, "without letting go of the 'cello." 
Fenchurch leant down. 
"I'm steadying the 'cello," she said. "You pull on the rope." 
The 'cello eased up level with the doorway, swinging slightly, and Fenchurch manoeuvred it inside. 
"Come on up yourself," she called down. 
Arthur picked up his bag of goodies and went in through the stable doors, tingling. 
The bottom room, which he had seen briefly before, was pretty rough and full of junk. A large old cast-iron mangle stood there, a surprising number of kitchen sinks were piled in a corner. There was also, Arthur was momentarily alarmed to see, a pram, but it was very old and uncomplicatedly full of books. 
The floor was old stained concrete, excitingly cracked. And this was the measure of Arthur's mood as he stared up the rickety wooden steps in the far corner. Even a cracked concrete floor seemed to him an almost unbearably sensual thing. 
"An architect friend of mine keeps on telling me how he can do wonderful things with this place," said Fenchurch chattily as Arthur emerged through the floor. "He keeps on coming round, standing in stunned amazement muttering about space and objects and events and marvellous qualities of light, then says he needs a pencil and disappears for weeks. Wonderful things have, therefore, so far failed to happen to it." 
In fact, thought Arthur as he looked about, the upper room was at least reasonably wonderful anyway. It was simply decorated, furnished with things made out of cushions and also a stereo set with speakers which would have impressed the guys who put up Stonehenge. 
There were flowers which were pale and pictures which were interesting. 
There was a sort of gallery structure in the roof space which held a bed and also a bathroom which, Fenchurch explained, you could actually swing a cat in. "But," she added, "only if it was a reasonably patient cat and didn't mind a few nasty cracks about the head. So. Here you are." 
"Yes." 
They looked at each other for a moment. 
The moment became a longer moment, and suddenly it was a very long moment, so long one could hardly tell where all the time was coming from. 
For Arthur, who could usually contrive to feel self-conscious if left alone for long enough with a Swiss Cheese plant, the moment was one of sustained revelation. He felt on the sudden like a cramped and zoo-born animal who awakes one morning to find the door to his cage hanging quietly open and the savannah stretching grey and pink to the distant rising sun, while all around new sounds are waking. 
He wondered what the new sounds were as he gazed at her openly wondering face and her eyes that smiled with a shared surprise. 
He hadn't realized that life speaks with a voice to you, a voice that brings you answers to the questions you continually ask of it, had never consciously detected it or recognized its tones till it now said something it had never said to him before, which was "Yes". 
Fenchurch dropped her eyes away at last, with a tiny shake of her head. 
"I know," she said. "I shall have to remember," she added, "that you are the sort of person who cannot hold on to a simple piece of paper for two minutes without winning a raffle with it." 
She turned away. 
"Let's go for a walk," she said quickly. "Hyde Park. I'll change into something less suitable." 
She was dressed in a rather severe dark dress, not a particularly shapely one, and it didn't really suit her. 
"I wear it specially for my 'cello teacher," she said. "He's a nice boy, but I sometimes think all that bowing gets him a bit excited. I'll be down in a moment." 
She ran lightly up the steps to the gallery above, and called down, "Put the bottle in the fridge for later." 
He noticed as he slipped the champagne bottle into the door that it had an identical twin to sit next to. 
He walked over to the window and looked out. He turned and started to look at her records. From above he heard the rustle of her dress fall to the ground. He talked to himself about the sort of person he was. He told himself very firmly that for this moment at least he would keep his eyes very firmly and steadfastly locked on to the spines of her records, read the titles, nod appreciatively, count the blasted things if he had to. He would keep his head down. 
This he completely, utterly and abjectly failed to do. 
She was staring down at him with such intensity that she seemed hardly to notice that he was looking up at her. Then suddenly she shook her head, dropped the light sundress over herself and disappeared quickly into the bathroom. 
She emerged a moment later, all smiles and with a sunhat and came tripping down the steps with extraordinary lightness. It was a strange kind of dancing motion she had. She saw that he noticed it and put her head slightly on one side. 
"Like it?" she said.â¨"You look gorgeous," he said simply, because she did.â¨"Hmmmm," she said, as if he hadn't really answered her question. 
She closed the upstairs front door which had stood open all this time, and looked around the little room to see that it was all in a fit state to be left on its own for a while. Arthur's eyes followed hers around, and while he was looking in the other direction she slipped something out of a drawer and into the canvas bag she was carrying. 
Arthur looked back at her. 
"Ready?" 
"Did you know," she said with a slightly puzzled smile, "that there's something wrong with me?" 
Her directness caught Arthur unprepared. 
"Well," he said, "I'd heard some vague sort of..." 
"I wonder how much you do know about me," she said. "I you heard it from where I think you heard then that's not it. Russell just sort of makes stuff up, because he can't deal with what it really is." 
A pang of worry went through Arthur. 
"Then what is it?" he said. "Can you tell me?" 
"Don't worry," she said, "it's nothing bad at all. Just unusual. Very very unusual." 
She touched his hand, and then leant forward and kissed him briefly. 
"I shall be very interested to know," she said, "if you manage to work out what it is this evening." 
Arthur felt that if someone tapped him at that point he would have chimed, like the deep sustained rolling chime his grey fishbowl made when he flicked it with his thumbnail. 
Chapter 19 
Ford Prefect was irritated to be continually wakened by the sound of gunfire. 
He slid himself out of the maintenance hatchway which he had fashioned into a bunk for himself by disabling some of the noisier machinery in his vicinity and padding it with towels. He slung himself down the access ladder and prowled the corridors moodily. 
They were claustrophobic and ill-lit, and what light there was continually flickering and dimming as power surged this way and that through the ship, causing heavy vibrations and rasping humming noises. 
That wasn't it, though. 
He paused and leaned back against the wall as something that looked like a small silver power drill flew past him down the dim corridor with a nasty searing screech. 
That wasn't it either. 
He clambered listlessly through a bulkhead door and found himself in a larger corridor, though still ill-lit. 
The ship lurched. It had been doing this a fair bit, but this was heavier. A small platoon of robots weent by making a terrible clattering. 
Still not it, though. 
Acrid smoke was drifting up from one end of the corridor, so he walked along it in the other direction. 
He passed a series of observation monitors let into the walls behind plates of toughened but still badly scratched perspex. 
One of them showed some horrible green scaly reptilian figure ranting and raving about the Single Transferable Vote system. It was hard to tell whether he was for or against it, but he clearly felt very strongly about it. Ford turned the sound down. 
That wasn't it, though. 
He passed another monitor. It was showing a commercial for some brand of toothpaste that would apparently make you feel free if you used it. There was nasty blaring music with it too, but that wasn't it. 
He came upon another, much larger three-dimensional screen that was monitoring the outside of the vast silver Xaxisian ship. 
As he watched, a thousand horribly beweaponed Zirzla robot starcruisers came searing round the dark shadow of a moon, silhouetted against the blinding disc of the star Xaxis, and the ship simultaneously unleashed a vicious blaze of hideously incomprehensible forces from all its orifices against them. 
That was it. 
Ford shook his head irritably and rubbed his eyes. He slumped on the wrecked body of a dull silver robot which clearly had been burning earlier on, but had now cooled down enough to sit on. 
He yawned and dug his copy of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy out of his satchel. He activated the screen, and flicked idly through some level three entries and some level four entries. He was looking for some good insomnia cures. He found REST, which was what he reckoned he needed. He found REST AND RECUPERATION and was about to pass on when he suddenly had a better idea. He looked up at the monitor screen. The battle was raging more fiercely every second and the noise was appalling. The ship juddered, screamed, and lurched as each new bolt of stunning energy was delivered or received. 
He looked back down at the Guide again and flipped through a few likely locations. He suddenly laughed, and then rummaged in his satchel again. 
He pulled out a small memory dump module, wiped off the fluff and biscuit crumbs, and plugged it into an interface on the back of the Guide. 
When all the information that he could think was relevant had been dumped into the module, he unplugged it again, tossed it lightly in the palm of his hand, put the Guide away in his satchel, smirked, and went in search of the ship's computer data banks. 
Chapter 20 
"The purpose of having the sun go low in the evenings, in the summer, especially in parks," said the voice earnestly, "is to make girl's breasts bob up and down more clearly to the eye. I am convinced that this is the case." 
Arthur and Fenchurch giggled about this to each other as they passed. She hugged him more tightly for a moment. 
"And I am certain," said the frizzy ginger-haired youth with the long thin nose who was epostulating from his deckchair by the side of the Serpentine, "that if one worked the argument through, one would find that it flowed with perfect naturalness and logic from everything," he insisted to his thin dark-haired companion who was slumped in the next door deckchair feeling dejected about his spots, "that Darwin was going on about. This is certain. This is indisputable. And," he added, "I love it." 
He turned sharply and squinted through his spectacles at Fenchurch. Arthur steered her away and could feel her silently quaking. 
"Next guess," she said, when she had stopped giggling, "come on." 
"All right," he said, "your elbow. Your left elbow. There's something wrong with your left elbow." 
"Wrong again," she said, "completely wrong. You're on completely the wrong track." 
The summer sun was sinking through the tress in the park, looking as if Let's not mince words. Hyde Park is stunning. Everything about it is stunning except for the rubbish on Monday mornings. Even the ducks are stunning. Anyone who can go through Hyde Park on a summer's evening and not feel moved by it is probably going through in an ambulance with the sheet pulled over their face. 
It is a park in which people do more extraordinary things than they do elsewhere. Arthur and Fenchurch found a man in shorts practising the bagpipes to himself under a tree. The piper paused to chase off an 
American couple who had tried, timidly to put some coins on the box his bagpipes came in. 
"No!" he shouted at them, "go away! I'm only practising." 
He started resolutely to reinflate his bag, but even the noise this made could not disfigure their mood. 
Arthur put his arms around her and moved them slowly downwards. 
"I don't think it can be your bottom," he said after a while," there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with that at all." 
"Yes," she agreed, "there's absolutely nothing wrong with my bottom." 
They kissed for so long that eventually the piper went and practised on the other side of the tree. 
"I'll tell you a story," said Arthur. 
"Good." 
They found a patch of grass which was relatively free of couples actually lying on top of each other and sat and watched the stunning ducks and the low sunlight rippling on the water which ran beneath the stunning ducks. 
"A story," said Fenchurch, cuddling his arm to her. 
"Which will tell you something of the sort of things that happen to me. It's absolutely true." 
"You know sometimes people tell you stories that are supposed to be something that happened to their wife's cousin's best friend, but actually probably got made up somewhere along the line." 
"Well, it's like one of those stories, except that it actually happened, and I know it actually happened, because the person it actually happened to was me." 
"Like the raffle ticket." 
Arthur laughed. "Yes. I had a train to catch," he went on. "I arrived at the station..." 
"Did I ever tell you," interrupted Fenchurch, "what happened to my parents in a station?" 
"Yes," said Arthur, "you did." "Just checking." 
Arthur glanced at his watch. "I suppose we could think of getting back," he said. 
"Tell me the story," said Fenchurch firmly. "You arrived at the station." 
"I was about twenty minutes early. I'd got the time of the train wrong. I suppose it is at least equally possible," he added after a moment's reflection, "that British Rail had got the time of the train wrong. Hadn't occurred to me before." 
"Get on with it." Fenchurch laughed. 
"So I bought a newspaper, to do the crossword, and went to the buffet to get a cup of coffee." 
"You do the crossword?"â¨"Yes."â¨"Which one?"â¨"The Guardian usually."â¨"I think it tries to be too cute. I prefer the Times. Did you solve it?" "What?" 
"The crossword in The Guardian." 
"I haven't had a chance to look at it yet," said Arthur, "I'm still trying to buy the coffee." 
"All right then. Buy the coffee."â¨"I'm buying it. I am also," said Arthur, "buying some biscuits." "What sort?"â¨"Rich Tea."â¨"Good choice." 
"I like them. Laden with all these new possessions, I go and sit at a table. And don't ask me what the table was like because this was some time ago and I can't remember. It was probably round." 
"All right." 
"So let me give you the layout. Me sitting at the table. On my left, the newspaper. On my right, the cup of coffee. In the middle of the table, the packet of biscuits." 
"I see it perfectly." 
"What you don't see," said Arthur, "because I haven't mentioned him yet, is the guy sitting at the table already. He is sitting there opposite me." 
"What's he like?" 
"Perfectly ordinary. Briefcase. Business suit. He didn't look," said Arthur, "as if he was about to do anything weird." 
"Ah. I know the type. What did he do?" 
"He did this. He leaned across the table, picked up the packet of biscuits, tore it open, took one out, and..." 
"What?" 
"Ate it." 
"What?" 
"He ate it." 
Fenchurch looked at him in astonishment. "What on Earth did you do?" 
"Well, in the circumstances I did what any red-blooded Englishman would do. I was compelled," said Arthur, "to ignore it." 
"What? Why?" 
"Well, it's not the sort of thing you're trained for is it? I searched my soul, and discovered that there was nothing anywhere in my upbringing, experience or even primal instincts to tell me how to react to someone who has quite simply, calmly, sitting right there in front of me, stolen one of my biscuits." 
"Well, you could..." Fenchurch thought about it. "I must say I'm not sure what I would have done either. So what happened?" 
"I stared furiously at the crossword," said Arthur. "Couldn't do a single clue, took a sip of coffee, it was too hot to drink, so there was nothing for it. I braced myself. I took a biscuit, trying very hard not to notice," he added, "that the packet was already mysteriously open..." 
"But you're fighting back, taking a tough line." 
"After my fashion, yes. I ate the biscuit. I ate it very deliberately and visibly, so that he would have no doubt as to what it was I was doing. When I eat a biscuit," Arthur said, "it stays eaten." 
"So what did he do?" 
"Took another one. Honestly," insisted Arthur, "this is exactly what happened. He took another biscuit, he ate it. Clear as daylight. Certain as we are sitting on the ground." 
Fenchurch stirred uncomfortably. 
"And the problem was," said Arthur, "that having not said anything the first time, it was somehow even more difficult to broach the subject the second time around. What do you say? 'Excuse me... I couldn't help noticing, er...' Doesn't work. No, I ignored it with, if anything, even more vigour than previously." 
"My man..." 
"Stared at the crossword, again, still couldn't budge a bit of it, so showing some of the spirit that Henry V did on St Crispin's Day..." 
"What?" 
"I went into the breach again. I took," said Arthur, "another biscuit. And for an instant our eyes met." 
"Like this?" 
"Yes, well, no, not quite like that. But they met. Just for an instant. And we both looked away. But I am here to tell you," said Arthur, "that there was a little electricity in the air. There was a little tension building up over the table. At about this time." 
"I can imagine."â¨"We went through the whole packet like this. Him, me, him, me ..." "The whole packet?" 
"Well it was only eight biscuits but it seemed like a lifetime of biscuits we were getting through at this point. Gladiators could hardly have had a tougher time." 
"Gladiators," said Fenchurch, "would have had to do it in the sun. More physically gruelling." 
"There is that. So. When the empty packet was lying dead between us the man at last got up, having done his worst, and left. I heaved a sigh of relief, of course. As it happened, my train was announced a moment or two later, so I finished my coffee, stood up, picked up the newspaper, and underneath the newspaper..." 
"Yes?"â¨"Were my biscuits."â¨"What?" said Fenchurch. "What?" 
"True." 
"No!" She gasped and tossed herself back on the grass laughing. 
She sat up again. 
"You completely nitwit," she hooted, "you almost completely and utterly foolish person." 
She pushed him backwards, rolled over him, kissed him and rolled off again. He was surprised at how light she was. 
"Now you tell me a story." 
"I thought," she said putting on a low husky voice, "that you were very keen to get back." 
"No hurry," he said airily, "I want you to tell me a story." 
She looked out over the kale and pondered. 
"All right," she said, "it's only a short one. And not funny like yours, but... Anyway." 
She looked down. Arthur could feel that it was one of those sorts of moments. The air seemed to stand still around them, waiting. Arthur wished that the air would go away and mind its own business. 
"When I was a kid," she said. "These sort of stories always start like this, don't they, 'When I was a kid...' Anyway. This is the bit where the girl suddenly says, 'When I was a kid' and starts to unburden herself. We have got to that bit. When I was a kid I had this picture hanging over the foot of my bed... What do you think of it so far?" 
"I like it. I think it's moving well. You're getting the bedroom interest in nice and early. We could probably do with some development with the picture." 
"It was one of those pictures that children are supposed to like," she said, "but don't. Full of endearing little animals doing endearing things, you know?" 
"I know. I was plagued with them too. Rabbits in waistcoats." 
"Exactly. These rabbits were in fact on a raft, as were assorted rats and owls. There may even have been a reindeer." 
"On the raft."â¨"On the raft. And a boy was sitting on the raft."â¨"Among the rabbits in waistcoats and the owls and the reindeer." "Precisely there. A boy of the cheery gypsy ragamuffin variety." "Ugh." 
"The picture worried me, I must say. There was an otter swimming in front of the raft, and I used to lie awake at night worrying about this otter having to pull the raft, with all these wretched animals on it who shouldn't even be on a raft, and the otter had such a thin tail to pull it with I thought it must hurt pulling it all the time. Worried me. Not badly, but just vaguely, all the time. 
"Then one day and remember I'd been looking at this picture every night for years I suddenly noticed that the raft had a sail. Never seen it before. The otter was fine, he was just swimming along." 
She shrugged. 
"Good story?" she said. 
"Ends weakly," said Arthur, "leaves the audience crying 'Yes, but what of it?' Fine up till there, but needs a final sting before the credits." 
Fenchurch laughed and hugged her legs. 
"It was just such a sudden revelation, years of almost unnoticed worry just dropping away, like taking off heavy weights, like black and white becoming colour, like a dry stick suddenly being watered. The sudden shift of perspective that says 'Put away your worries, the world is a good and perfect place. It is in fact very easy.' You probably thing I'm saying that because I'm going to say that I felt like that this afternoon or something, don't you?" 
"Well, I..." said Arthur, his composure suddenly shattered. 
"Well, it's all right," she said, "I did. That's exactly what I felt. But you see, I've felt that before, even stronger. Incredibly strongly. I'm afraid I'm a bit of a one," she said gazing off into the distance, "for sudden startling revelations." 
Arthur was at sea, could hardly speak, and felt it wiser, therefore, for the moment not to try. 
"It was very odd," she said, much as one of the pursuing Egyptians might have said that the behaviour of the Red Sea when Moses waved his rod at it was a little on the strange side. 
"Very odd," she repeated, "for days before, the strangest feeling had been building in me, as if I was going to give birth. No, it wasn't like that in fact, it was more as if I was being connected into 
something, bit by bit. No, not even that; it was as if the whole of the Earth, through me, was going to..." 
"Does the number," said Arthur gently, "forty-two mean anything to you at all?" 
"What? No, what are you talking about?" exclaimed Fenchurch. 
"Just a thought," murmured Arthur. 
"Arthur, I mean this, this is very real to me, this is serious." 
"I was being perfectly serious," said Arthur. "It's just the Universe I'm never quite sure about." 
"What do you mean by that?" 
"Tell me the rest of it," he said. "Don't worry if it sounds odd. Believe me, you are talking to someone who has seen a lot of stuff," he added, "that is odd. And I don't mean biscuits." 
She nodded, and seemed to believe him. Suddenly, she gripped his arm. 
"It was so simple," she said, "so wonderfully and extraordinarily simple, when it came." 
"What was it?" said Arthur quietly. 
"Arthur, you see," she said, "that's what I no longer know. And the loss is unbearable. If I try to think back to it, it all goes flickery and jumpy, and if I try too hard, I get as far as the teacup and I just black out." 
"What?" 
"Well, like your story," she said, "the best bit happened in a cafe. I was sitting there, having a cup of tea. This was after days of this build up, the feeling of becoming connected up. I think I was buzzing gently. And there was some work going on at a building site opposite the cafe, and I was watching it through the window, over the rim of my teacup, which I always find is the nicest way of watching other people working. And suddenly, there it was in my mind, this message from somewhere. And it was so simple. It made such sense of everything. I just sat up and thought, 'Oh! Oh, well that's all right then.' I was so startled I almost dropped my teacup, in fact I think I did drop it. Yes," she added thoughtfully, "I'm sure I did. How much sense am I making?" 
"It was fine up to the bit about the teacup." 
She shook her head, and shook it again, as if trying to clear it, which is what she was trying to do. 
"Well that's it," she said. "Fine up to the bit about the teacup. That was the point at which it seemed to me quite literally as if the world exploded." 
"What...?" 
"I know it sounds crazy, and everybody says it was hallucinations, but if that was hallucinations then I have hallucinations in big screen 3D with 16-track Dolby Stereo and should probably hire myself out to people who are bored with shark movies. It was as if the ground was literally ripped from under my feet, and... and..." 
She patted the grass lightly, as if for reassurance, and then seemed to change her mind about what she was going to say. 
"And I woke up in hospital. I suppose I've been in and out ever since. And that's why I have an instinctive nervousness," she said, "of sudden startling revelations that's everything's going to be all right." She looked up at him. 
Arthur had simply ceased to worry himself about the strange anomalies surrounding his return to his home world, or rather had consigned them to that part of his mind marked "Things to think about Urgent." "Here is the world," he had told himself. "Here, for whatever reason, is the world, and here it stays. With me on it." But now it seemed to go swimmy around him, as it had that night in the car when Fenchurch's brother had told him the silly stories about the CIA agent in the reservoir. The trees went swimmy. The lake went swimmy, but this was perfectly natural and nothing to be alarmed by because a grey goose had just landed on it. The geese were having a great relaxed time and had no major answers they wished to know the questions to. 
"Anyway," said Fenchurch, suddenly and brightly and with a wide- eyed smile, "there is something wrong with part of me, and you've got to find out what it is. We'll go home." 
Arthur shook his head. 
"What's the matter?" she said. 
Arthur had shaken his head, not to disagree with her suggestion which he thought was a truly excellent one, one of the world's great suggestions, but because he was just for a moment trying to free 
himself of the recurring impression he had that just when he was least expecting it the Universe would suddenly leap out from behind a door and go boo at him. 
"I'm just trying to get this entirely clear in my mind," said Arthur, "you say you felt as if the Earth actually... exploded ..." 
"Yes. More than felt." 
"Which is what everybody else says," he said hesitantly, "is hallucinations?" 
"Yes, but Arthur that's ridiculous. People think that if you just say 'hallucinations' it explains anything you want it to explain and eventually whatever it is you can't understand will just go away. It's just a word, it doesn't explain anything. It doesn't explain why the dolphins disappeared." 
"No," said Arthur. "No," he added thoughtfully. "No," he added again, even more thoughtfully. "What?" he said at last. 
"Doesn't explain the dolphins disappearing." 
"No," said Arthur, "I see that. Which dolphins do you mean?" 
"What do you mean which dolphins? I'm talking about when all the dolphins disappeared." 
She put her hand on his knee, which made him realize that the tingling going up and down his spine was not her gently stroking his back, and must instead be one of the nasty creepy feelings he so often got when people were trying to explain things to him. 
"The dolphins?"â¨"Yes."â¨"All the dolphins," said Arthur, "disappeared?" "Yes." 
"The dolphins? You're saying the dolphins all disappeared? Is this," said Arthur, trying to be absolutely clear on this point, "what you're saying?" 
"Arthur where have you been for heaven's sake? The dolphins all disappeared on the same day I..." 
She stared him intently in his startled eyes. "What...?"â¨"No dolphins. All gone. Vanished."â¨She searched his face. 
"Did you really not know that?"â¨It was clear from his startled expression that he did not. "Where did they go?" he asked. 
"No one knows. That's what vanished means." She paused. "Well, there is one man who says he knows about it, but everyone says he lives in California," she said, "and is mad. I was thinking of going to see him because it seems the only lead I've got on what happened to me." 
She shrugged, and then looked at him long and quietly. She lay her hand on the side of his face. 
"I really would like to know where you've been," she said. "I think something terrible happened to you then as well. And that's why we recognized each other." 
She glanced around the park, which was now being gathered into the clutches of dusk. 
"Well," she said, "now you've got someone you can tell." Arthur slowly let out a long year of a sigh.â¨"It is," he said, "a very long story."â¨Fenchurch leaned across him and drew over her canvas bag. 
"Is it anything to do with this?" she said. The thing she took out of her bag was battered and travelworn as it had been hurled into prehistoric rivers, baked under the sun that shines so redly on the deserts of Kakrafoon, half-buried in the marbled sands that fringe the heady vapoured oceans of Santraginus V, frozen on the glaciers of the moon of Jaglan Beta, sat on, kicked around spaceships, scuffed and generally abused, and since its makers had thought that these were exactly the sorts of things that might happen to it, they had thoughtfully encased it in a sturdy plastic cover and written on it, in large friendly letters, the words "Don't Panic". 
"Where did you get this?" said Arthur, startled, taking it from her. 
"Ah," she said, "I thought it was yours. In Russell's car that night. You dropped it. Have you been to many of these places?" 
Arthur drew the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy from its cover. It was like a small, thin, flexible lap computer. He tapped some buttons till the screen flared with text. 
"A few," he said. 
"Can we go to them?" 
"What? No," said Arthur abruptly, then relented, but relented warily. "Do you want to?" he said, hoping for the answer no. It was an act of great generosity on his part not to say, "You don't want to, do you?" which expects it. 
"Yes," she said. "I want to know what the message was that I lost, and where it came from. Because I don't think," she added, standing up and looking round the increasing gloom of the park, "that it came from here." 
"I'm not even sure," she further added, slipping her arm around Arthur's waist, "that I know where here is." 
Chapter 21 
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is, as has been remarked before often and accurately, a pretty startling kind of a thing. It is, essentially, as the title implies, a Guide book. The problem is, or rather one of the problems, for there are many, a sizeable portion of which are continually clogging up the civil, commercial and criminal courts in all areas of the Galaxy, and especially, where possible, the more corrupt ones, this. 
The previous sentence makes sense. That is not the problem. This is:â¨Change.â¨Read it through again and you'll get it. 
The Galaxy is a rapidly changing place. There is, frankly, so much of it, every bit of which is continually on the move, continually changing. A bit of a nightmare, you might think, for a scrupulous and conscientious editor diligently striving to keep this massively detailed and complex electronic tome abreast of all the changing circumstances and conditions that the Galaxy throws up every minute of every hour of every day, and you would be wrong. Where you would be wrong would be in failing to realize that the editor, like all the editors of the Guide has ever had, has no real grasp of the meanings of the words "scrupulous", "conscientious" or "diligent", and tends to get his nightmares through a straw. 
Entries tend to get updated or not across the Sub-Etha Net according to if they read good. 
Take for example, the case of Brequinda on the Foth of Avalars, famed in myth, legend and stultifyingly dull tri-d mini-serieses as home of the magnificent and magical Fuolornis Fire Dragon. 
In Ancient days, when Fragilis sang and Saxaquine of the Quenelux held sway, when the air was sweet and the nights fragrant, but everyone somehow managed to be, or so they claimed, though how on earth they could have thought that anyone was even remotely 
likely to believe such a preposterous claim what with all the sweet air and fragrant nights and whatnot is anyone's guess, virgins, it was not possible to heave a brick on Brequinda in the Foth of Avalars without hitting at least half a dozen Fuolornis Fire Dragons. 
Whether you would want to do that is another matter. 
Not that Fire Dragons weren't an essentially peace-loving species, because they were. They adored it to bits, and this wholesale adoring of things to bits was often in itself the problem: one so often hurts the one loves, especially if one is a Fuolornis Fire Dragon with breath like a rocket booster and teeth like a park fence. Another problem was that once they were in the mood they often went on to hurt quite a lot of the ones that other people loved as well. Add to all that the relatively small number of madmen who actually went around the place heaving bricks, and you end up with a lot of people on Brequinda in the Foth of Avalars getting seriously hurt by dragons. 
But did they mind? They did not. 
Were they heard to bemoan their fate? No. 
The Fuolornis Fire Dragons were revered throughout the lands of Brequinda in the Foth of valors for their savage beauty, their noble ways and their habit of biting people who didn't revere them. 
Why was this?â¨The answer was simple. Sex. 
There is, for some unfathomed reason, something almost unbearably sexy about having huge fire-breathing magical dragons flying low about the sky on moonlit nights which were already dangerously on the sweet and fragrant side. 
Why this should be so, the romance-besotted people of Brequinda in the Foth of Avalars could not have told you, and would not have stopped to discuss the matter once the effect was up and going, for no sooner would a flock of half a dozen silk-winged leather-bodied Fuolornis Fire Dragons heave into sight across the evening horizon than half the people of Brequinda are scurrying off into the woods with the other half, there to spend a busy breathless night together and emerge with the first rays of dawn all smiling and happy and still claiming, rather endearingly, to be virgins, if rather flushed and sticky virgins. 
Pheromones, some researchers said. 
Something sonic, others claimed. 
The place was always stiff with researchers trying to get to the bottom of it all and taking a very long time about it. 
Not surprisingly, the Guide's graphically enticing description of the general state of affairs on this planet has proved to be astonishingly popular amongst hitch-hikers who allow themselves to be Guided by it, and so it has simply never been taken out, and it is therefore left to latter-day travellers to find out for themselves that today's modern Brequinda in the City State of Avalars is now little more than concrete, strip joints and Dragon Burger Bars. 
Chapter 22 
The night in Islington was sweet and fragrant. 
There were, of course, no Fuolornis Fire Dragons about in the alley, but if any had chanced by they might just as well have sloped off across the road for a pizza, for they were not going to be needed. 
Had an emergency cropped up while they were still in the middle of their American Hots with extra anchovy they could always have sent across a message to put Dire Straits on the stereo, which is now known to have much the same effect. 
"No," said Fenchurch, "not yet." 
Arthur put Dire Straits on the stereo. Fenchurch pushed ajar the upstairs front door to let in a little more of the sweet fragrant night air. They both sat on some of the furniture made out of cushions, very close to the open bottle of champagne. 
"No," said Fenchurch, "not till you've found out what's wrong with me, which bit. But I suppose," she added very, very, very quietly, "that we may as well start with where your hand is now." 
Arthur said, "So which way do I go?" "Down," said Fenchurch, "on this occasion." He moved his hand.â¨"Down," she said, "is in fact the other way." "Oh yes." 
Mark Knopfler has an extraordinary ability to make a Schecter Custom Stratocaster hoot and sing like angels on a Saturday night, exhausted from being good all week and needing a stiff beer which is not strictly relevant at this point since the record hadn't yet got to that bit, but there will be too much else going on when it does, and furthermore the chronicler does not intend to sit here with a track list and a stopwatch, so it seems best to mention it now while things are still moving slowly. 
"And so we come," said Arthur, "to your knee. There is something terribly and tragically wrong with your left knee." 
"My left knee," said Fenchurch, "is absolutely fine." "Do it is."â¨"Did you know that..."â¨"What?" 
"Ahm, it's all right. I can tell you do. No, keep going." 
"So it has to be something to do with your feet..." 
She smiled in the dim light, and wriggled her shoulders noncommittally against the cushions. Since there are cushions in the Universe, on Squornshellous Beta to be exact, two worlds in from the swampland of the mattresses, that actively enjoy being wriggled against, particularly if it's noncommittally because of the syncopated way in which the shoulders move, it's a pity they weren't there. They weren't, but such is life. 
Arthur held her left foot in his lap and looked it over carefully. All kinds of stuff about the way her dress fell away from her legs was making it difficult for him to think particularly clearly at this point. 
"I have to admit," he said, "that I really don't know what I'm looking for." 
"You'll know when you find it," she said. "Really you will." There was a slight catch in her voice. "It's not that one." 
Feeling increasingly puzzled, Arthur let her left foot down on the floor and moved himself around so that he could take her right foot. She moved forward, put her arms round and kissed him, because the record had got to that bit which, if you knew the record, you would know made it impossible not to do this. 
Then she gave him her right foot. 
He stroked it, ran his fingers round her ankle, under her toes, along her instep, could find nothing wrong with it. 
She watched him with great amusement, laughed and shook her head. 
"No, don't stop," she said, "but it's not that one now." Arthur stopped, and frowned at her left foot on the floor. "Don't stop." 
He stroked her right foot, ran his fingers around her ankle, under her toes, along her instep and said, "You mean it's something to do with which leg I'm holding...?" 
She did another of the shrugs which would have brought such joy into the life of a simple cushion from Squornshellous Beta. 
He frowned. 
"Pick me up," she said quietly. 
He let her right foot down to the floor and stood up. So did she. He picked her up in his arms and they kissed again. This went on for a while, then she said, "Now put me down again." 
Still puzzled, he did so.â¨"Well?"â¨She looked at him almost challengingly. "So what's wrong with my feet?" she said. 
Arthur still did not understand. He sat on the floor, then got down on his hands and knees to look at her feet, in situ, as it were, in their normal habitat. And as he looked closely, something odd struck him. He pit his head right down to the ground and peered. There was a long pause. He sat back heavily. 
"Yes," he said, "I see what's wrong with your feet. They don't touch the ground." 
"So... so what do you think...?" 
Arthur looked up at her quickly and saw the deep apprehension making her eyes suddenly dark. She bit her lip and was trembling. 
"What do..." she stammered. "Are you...?" She shook the hair forwards over her eyes that were filling with dark fearful tears. 
He stood up quickly, put his arms around her and gave her a single kiss. 
"Perhaps you can do what I can do," he said, and walked straight out of her upstairs front door. 
The record got to the good bit. 
Chapter 23 
The battle raged on about the star of Xaxis. Hundreds of the fierce and horribly beweaponed Zirzla ships had now been smashed and wrenched to atoms by the withering forces the huge silver Xaxisian ship was able to deploy. 
Part of the moon had gone too, blasted away by those same blazing forceguns that ripped the very fabric of space as they passed through it. 
The Zirzla ships that remained, horribly beweaponed though they were, were now hopelessly outclassed by the devastating power of the Xaxisian ship, and were fleeing for cover behind the rapidly disintegrating moon, when the Xaxisian ship, in hurtling pursuit behind them, suddenly announced that it needed a holiday and left the field of battle. 
All was redoubled fear and consternation for a moment, but the ship was gone. 
With the stupendous powers at its command it flitted across vast tracts of irrationally shaped space, quickly, effortlessly, and above all, quietly. 
Deep in his greasy, smelly bunk, fashioned out of a maintenance hatchway, Ford Prefect slept among his towels, dreaming of old haunts. He dreamed at one point in his slumbers of New York. 
In his dream he was walking late at night along the East Side, beside the river which had become so extravagantly polluted that new lifeforms were now emerging from it spontaneously, demanding welfare and voting rights. 
One of those now floated past, waving. Ford waved back. 
The thing thrashed to the shore and struggled up the bank. 
"Hi," it said, "I've just been created. I'm completely new to the Universe in all respects. Is there anything you can tell me?" 
"Phew," said Ford, a little nonplussed, "I can tell you where some bars are, I guess." 
"What about love and happiness. I sense deep needs for things like that," it said, waving its tentacles. "Got any leads there?" 
"You can get some like what you require," said Ford, "on Seventh Avenue." 
"I instinctively feel," said the creature, urgently, "that I need to be beautiful. Am I?" 
"You're pretty direct, aren't you?" 
"No point in mucking about. Am I?" 
"To me?" said Ford. "No. But listen," he added after a moment, "most people make out, you know. Are there and like you down there?" 
"Search me, buster," said the creature, "as I said, I'm new here. Life is entirely strange to me. What's it like?" 
Here was something that Ford felt he could speak about with authority. 
"Life," he said, "is like a grapefruit." 
"Er, how so?" 
"Well, it's sort of orangey-yellow and dimpled on the outside, wet and squidgy in the middle. It's got pips inside, too. Oh, and some people have half a one for breakfast." 
"Is there anyone else out there I can talk to?" 
"I expect so," said Ford. "Ask a policeman." 
Deep in his bunk, Ford Prefect wriggled and turned on to his other side. It wasn't his favourite type of dream because it didn't have Eccentrica Gallumbits, the Triple-Breasted Whore of Eroticon VI in it, whom many of his dreams did feature. But at least it was a dream. At least he was asleep. 
Chapter 24 
Luckily there was a strong updraft in the alley because Arthur hadn't done this sort of thing for a while, at least, not deliberately, and deliberately is exactly the way you are not meant to do it. 
He swung down sharply, nearly catching himself a nasty crack on the jaw with the doorstep and tumbled through the air, so suddenly stunned with what a profoundly stupid thing he had just done that he completely forgot the bit about hitting the ground and didn't. 
A nice trick, he thought to himself, if you can do it. 
The ground was hanging menacingly above his head. 
He tried not to think about the ground, what an extraordinarily big thing it was and how much it would hurt him if it decided to stop hanging there and suddenly fell on him. He tried to think nice thoughts about lemurs instead, which was exactly the right thing to do because he couldn't at that moment remember precisely what a lemur was, if it was one of those things that sweep in great majestic herds across the plains of wherever it was or if that was wildebeests, so it was a tricky kind of thing to think nice thoughts about without simply resorting to an icky sort of general well-disposedness towards things, and all this kept his mind well occupied while his body tried to adjust to the fact that it wasn't touching anything. 
A Mars bar wrapper fluttered down the alleyway. 
After a seeming moment of doubt and indecision it eventually allowed the wind to ease it, fluttering, between him and the ground. 
"Arthur..." 
The ground was still hanging menacingly above his head, and he thought it was probably time to do something about that, such as fall away from it, which is what he did. Slowly. Very, very slowly. 
As he fell slowly, very, very slowly, he closed his eyes carefully, so as not to jolt anything. 
The feel of his eyes closing ran down his whole body. Once it had reached his feet, and the whole of his body was alerted to the fact 
that his eyes were now closed and was not panicked by it, he slowly, very, very slowly, revolved his body one way and his mind the other. 
That should sort the ground out. 
He could feel the air clear about him now, breezing around him quite cheerfully, untroubled by his being there, and slowly, very, very slowly, as from a deep and distant sleep, he opened his eyes. 
He had flown before, of course, flown many times on Krikkit until all the birdtalk had driven him scatty, but this was different. 
Here he was on his own world, quietly, and without fuss, beyond a slight trembling which could have been attributable to a number of things, being in the air. 
Ten or fifteen feet below him was the hard tarmac and a few yards off to the right the yellow street lights of Upper Street. 
Luckily the alleyway was dark since the light which was supposed to see it through the night was on an ingenious timeswitch which meant it came on just before lunchtime and went off again as the evening was beginning to draw in. He was, therefore, safely shrouded in a blanket of dark obscurity. 
He slowly, very, very slowly, lifted his head to Fenchurch, who was standing in silent breathless amazement, silhouetted in her upstairs doorway. 
Her face was inches from his. 
"I was about to ask you," she said in a low trembly voice, "what you were doing. But then I realized that I could see what you were doing. You were flying. So it seemed," she went on after a slight wondering pause, "like a bit of a silly question." 
Arthur said, "Can you do it?" 
"No." 
"Would you like to try?" 
She bit her lip and shook her head, not so much to say no, but just in sheer bewilderment. She was shaking like a leaf. 
"It's quite easy," urged Arthur, "if you don't know how. That's the important bit. Be not at all sure how you're doing it." 
Just to demonstrate how easy it was he floated away down the alley, fell upwards quite dramatically and bobbed back down to her like a banknote on a breath of wind. 
"Ask me how I did that."â¨"How... did you do that?"â¨"No idea. Not a clue."â¨She shrugged in bewilderment. "So how can I...?"â¨Arthur bobbed down a little lower and held out his hand.â¨"I want you to try," he said, "to step on my hand. Just one foot." "What?" 
"Try it." 
Nervously, hesitantly, almost, she told herself, as if she was trying to step on the hand of someone who was floating in front of her in midair, she stepped on to his hand. 
"Now the other."â¨"What?"â¨"Take the weight off your back foot." "I can't."â¨"Try it."â¨"Like this?"â¨"Like that." 
Nervously, hesitantly, almost, she told herself, as if She stopped telling herself what she was doing was like because she had a feeling she didn't altogether want to know. 
She fixed her eyes very firmly on the guttering of the roof of the decrepit warehouse opposite which had been annoying her for weeks because it was clearly going to fall off and she wondered if anyone was going to do anything about it or whether she ought to say something to somebody, and didn't think for a moment about the fact that she was standing on the hands of someone who wasn't standing on anything at all. 
"Now," said Arthur, "take your weight off your left foot." 
She thought that the warehouse belonged to the carpet company who had their offices round the corner, and took the weight off her left foot, so she should probably go and see them about the gutter. 
"Now," said Arthur, "take the weight off your right foot." "I can't."â¨"Try." 
She hadn't seen the guttering from quite this angle before, and it looked to her now as if as well as the mud and gunge up there might also be a bird's nest. If she leaned forward just a little and took her weight off her right foot, she could probably see it more clearly. 
Arthur was alarmed to see that someone down in the alley was trying to steal her bicycle. He particularly didn't want to get involved in an argument at the moment and hoped that the guy would do it quietly and not look up. 
He had the quiet shifty look of someone who habitually stole bicycles in alleys and habitually didn't expect to find their owners hovering several feet above them. He was relaxed by both these habits, and went about his job with purpose and concentration, and when he found that the bike was unarguably bound by hoops of tungsten carbide to an iron bar embedded in concrete, he peacefully bent both its wheels and went on his way. 
Arthur let out a long-held breath. 
"See what a piece of eggshell I have found you," said Fenchurch in his ear. 
Chapter 25 
Those who are regular followers of the doings of Arthur Dent may have received an impression of his character and habits which, while it includes the truth and, of course, nothing but the truth, falls somewhat short, in its composition, of the whole truth in all its glorious aspects. 
And the reasons for this are obvious. Editing, selection, the need to balance that which is interesting with that which is relevant and cut out all the tedious happenstance. 
Like this for instance. "Arthur Dent went to bed. He went up the stairs, all fifteen of them, opened the door, went into his room, took off his shoes and socks and then all the rest of his clothes one by one and left them in a neatly crumpled heap on the floor. He put on his pyjamas, the blue ones with the stripe. He washed his face and hands, cleaned his teeth, went to the lavatory, realized that he had once again got this all in the wrong order, had to wash his hands again and went to bed. He read for fifteen minutes, spending the first ten minutes of that trying to work out where in the book he had got to the previous night, then he turned out the light and within a minute or so more was asleep. 
"It was dark. He lay on his left side for a good hour. 
"After that he moved restlessly in his sleep for a moment and then turned over to sleep on his right side. Another hour after this his eyes flickered briefly and he slightly scratched his nose, though there was still a good twenty minutes to go before he turned back on to his left side. And so he whiled the night away, sleeping. 
"At four he got up and went to the lavatory again. He opened the door to the lavatory..." and so on. 
It's guff. It doesn't advance the action. It makes for nice fat books such as the American market thrives on, but it doesn't actually get you anywhere. You don't, in short, want to know. 
But there are other omissions as well, beside the teethcleaning and trying to find fresh socks variety, and in some of these people have often seemed inordinately interested. 
What, they want to know, about all that stuff off in the wings with Arthur and Trillian, did that ever get anywhere? 
To which the answer is, of course, mind your own business. 
And what, they say, was he up to all those nights on the planet Krikkit? Just because the planet didn't have Fuolornis Fire Dragons or Dire Straits doesn't mean that everyone just sat up every night reading. 
Or to take a more specific example, what about the night after the committee meeting party on Prehistoric Earth, when Arthur found himself sitting on a hillside watching the moon rise over the softly burning trees in company with a beautiful young girl called Mella, recently escaped from a lifetime of staring every morning at a hundred nearly identical photographs of moodily lit tubes of toothpaste in the art department of an advertising agency on the planet Golgafrincham. What then? What happened next? And the answer is, of course, that the book ended. 
The next one didn't resume the story till five years later, and you can, claim some, take discretion too far. "This Arthur Dent," comes the cry from the furthest reaches of the galaxy, and has even now been found inscribed on a mysterious deep space probe thought to originate from an alien galaxy at a distance too hideous to contemplate, "What is he, man or mouse? Is he interested in nothing more than tea and the wider issues of life? Has he no spirit? Has he no passion? Does he not, to put it in a nutshell, fuck?" 
Those who wish to know should read on. Others may wish to skip on to the last chapter which is a good bit and has Marvin in it. 
Chapter 26 
Arthur Dent allowed himself for an unworthy moment to think, as they drifted up, that he very much hoped that his friends who had always found him pleasant but dull, or more latterly, odd but dull, were having a good time in the pub, but that was the last time, for a while, that he thought of them. 
They drifted up, spiralling slowly around each other, like sycamore seeds falling from sycamore trees in the autumn, except going the other way. 
And as they drifted up their minds sang with the ecstatic knowledge that either what they were doing was completely and utterly and totally impossible or that physics had a lot of catching up to do. 
Physics shook its head and, looking the other way, concentrated on keeping the cars going along the Euston Road and out towards the Westway flyover, on keeping the streetlights lit and on making sure that when somebody on Baker Street dropped a cheeseburger it went splat upon the ground. 
Dwindling headily beneath them, the beaded strings of light of London London, Arthur had to keep reminding himself, not the strangely coloured fields of Krikkit on the remote fringes of the galaxy, lighted freckles of which faintly spanned the opening sky above them, but London swayed, swaying and turning, turned. 
"Try a swoop," he called to Fenchurch. 
"What?" 
Her voice seemed strangely clear but distant in all the vast empty air. It was breathy and faint with disbelief all those things, clear, faint, distant, breathy, all at the same time. 
"We're flying..." she said.â¨"A trifle," called Arthur, "think nothing of it. Try a swoop." "A sw " 
Her hand caught his, and in a second her weight caught it too, and stunningly, she was gone, tumbling beneath him, clawing wildly at nothing. 
Physics glanced at Arthur, and clotted with horror he was gone too, sick with giddy dropping, every part of him screaming but his voice. 
They plummeted because this was London and you really couldn't do this sort of thing here. 
He couldn't catch her because this was London, and not a million miles from here, seven hundred and fifty-six, to be exact, in Pisa, Galileo had clearly demonstrated that two falling bodies fell at exactly the same rate of acceleration irrespective of their relative weights. 
They fell. 
Arthur realized as he fell, giddily and sickeningly, that if he was going to hang around in the sky believing everything that the Italians had to say about physics when they couldn't even keep a simple tower straight, that they were in dead trouble, and damn well did fall faster than Fenchurch. 
He grappled her from above, and fumbled for a tight grip on her shoulders. He got it. 
Fine. They were now falling together, which was all very sweet and romantic, but didn't solve the basic problem, which was that they were falling, and the ground wasn't waiting around to see if he had any more clever tricks up his sleeve, but was coming up to meet them like an express train. 
He couldn't support her weight, he hadn't anything he could support it with or against. The only thing he could think was that they were obviously going to die, and if he wanted anything other than the obvious to happen he was going to have to do something other than the obvious. Here he felt he was on familiar territory. 
He let go of her, pushed her away, and when she turned her face to him in a gasp of stunned horror, caught her little finger with his little finger and swung her back upwards, tumbling clumsily up after her. 
"Shit," she said, as she sat panting and breathless on absolutely nothing at all, and when she had recovered herself they fled on up into the night. 
Just below cloud level they paused and scanned where they had impossibly come. The ground was something not to regard with any 
too firm or steady an eye, but merely to glance at, as it were, in passing. 
Fenchurch tried some little swoops, daringly, and found that if she judged herself just right against a body of wind she could pull off some really quite dazzling ones with a little pirouette at the end, followed by a little drop which made her dress billow around her, and this is where readers who are keen to know what Marvin and Ford Prefect have been up to all this while should look ahead to later chapters, because Arthur now could wait no longer and helped her take it off. 
It drifted down and away whipped by the wind until it was a speck which finally vanished, and for various complicated reasons revolutionized the life of a family on Hounslow, over whose washing line it was discovered draped in the morning. 
In a mute embrace, they drifted up till they were swimming amongst the misty wraiths of moisture that you can see feathering around the wings of an aeroplane but never feel because you are sitting warm inside the stuffy aeroplane and looking through the little scratchy perspex window while somebody else's son tries patiently to pour warm milk into your shirt. 
Arthur and Fenchurch could feel them, wispy cold and thin, wreathing round their bodies, very cold, very thin. They felt, even Fenchurch, now protected from the elements by only a couple of fragments from Marks and Spencer, that if they were not going to let the force of gravity bother them, then mere cold or paucity of atmosphere could go and whistle. 
The two fragments from Marks and Spencer which, as Fenchurch rose now into the misty body of the clouds, Arthur removed very, very slowly, which is the only way it's possible to do it when you're flying and also not using your hands, went on to create considerable havoc in the morning in, respectively, counting from top to bottom, Isleworth and Richmond. 
They were in the cloud for a long time, because it was stacked very high, and when finally they emerged wetly above it, Fenchurch slowly spinning like a starfish lapped by a rising tidepool, they found that above the clouds is where the night get seriously moonlit. 
The light is darkly brilliant. There are different mountains up there, but they are mountains, with their own white arctic snows. 
They had emerged at the top of the high-stacked cumulo-nimbus, and now began lazily to drift down its contours, as Fenchurch eased Arthur in turn from his clothes, prised him free of them till all were gone, winding their surprised way down into the enveloping whiteness. 
She kissed him, kissed his neck, his chest, and soon they were drifting on, turning slowly, in a kind of speechless T-shape, which might have caused even a Fuolornis Fire Dragon, had one flown past, replete with pizza, to flap its wings and cough a little. 
There were, however, no Fuolornis Fire Dragons in the clouds nor could there be for, like the dinosaurs, the dodos, and the Greater Drubbered Wintwock of Stegbartle Major in the constellation Fraz, and unlike the Boeing 747 which is in plentiful supply, they are sadly extinct, and the Universe shall never know their like again. 
The reason that a Boeing 747 crops up rather unexpectedly in the above list is not unconnected with the fact that something very similar happened in the lives of Arthur and Fenchurch a moment or two later. 
They are big things, terrifyingly big. You know when one is in the air with you. There is a thunderous attack of air, a moving wall of screaming wind, and you get tossed aside, if you are foolish enough to be doing anything remotely like what Arthur and Fenchurch were doing in its close vicinity, like butterflies in the Blitz. 
This time, however, there was a heart-sickening fall or loss of nerve, a re-grouping moments later and a wonderful new idea enthusiastically signalled through the buffeting noise. 
Mr.s E. Kapelsen of Boston, Massachusetts was an elderly lady, indeed, she felt her life was nearly at an end. She had seen a lot of it, been puzzled by some, but, she was a little uneasy to feel at this late stage, bored by too much. It had all been very pleasant, but perhaps a little too explicable, a little too routine. 
With a sigh she flipped up the little plastic window shutter and looked out over the wing. 
At first she thought she ought to call the stewardess, but then she thought no, damn it, definitely not, this was for her, and her alone. 
By the time her two inexplicable people finally slipped back off the wing and tumbled into the slipstream she had cheered up an awful lot. 
She was mostly immensely relieved to think that virtually everything that anybody had ever told her was wrong. 
The following morning Arthur and Fenchurch slept very late in the alley despite the continual wail of furniture being restored. 
The following night they did it all over again, only this time with Sony Walkmen. 
Chapter 27 
"This is all very wonderful," said Fenchurch a few days later. "But I do need to know what has happened to me. You see, there's this difference between us. That you lost something and found it again, and I found something and lost it. I need to find it again." 
She had to go out for the day, so Arthur settled down for a day of telephoning. 
Murray Bost Henson was a journalist on one of the papers with small pages and big print. It would be pleasant to be able to say that he was none the worse for it, but sadly, this was not the case. He happened to be the only journalist that Arthur knew, so Arthur phoned him anyway. 
"Arthur my old soup spoon, my old silver turreen, how particularly stunning to hear from you. Someone told me you'd gone off into space or something." 
Murray had his own special kind of conversation language which he had invented for his own use, and which no one else was able toâ¨speak or even to follow. Hardly any of it meant anything at all. Theâ¨bits which did mean anything were often so wonderfully buried that no one could ever spot them slipping past in the avalance of nonsense. The time when you did find out, later, which bits he did mean, was often a bad time for all concerned. 
"What?" said Arthur. 
"Just a rumour my old elephant tusk, my little green baize card table, just a rumour. Probably means nothing at all, but I may need a quote from you." 
"Nothing to say, just pub talk." 
"We thrive on it, my old prosthetic limb, we thrive on it. Plus it would fit like a whatsit in one of those other things with the other stories of the week, so it could be just to have you denying it. Excuse me, something has just fallen out of my ear." 
There was a slight pause, at the end of which Murray Bost Henson came back on the line sounding genuinely shaken. 
"Just remembered," he said, "what an odd evening I had last night. Anyway my old, I won't say what, how do you feel about having ridden on Halley's Comet?" 
"I haven't," said Arthur with a suppressed sigh, "ridden on Halley's Comet." 
"OK, How do you feel about not having ridden on Halley's Comet?" "Pretty relaxed, Murray."â¨There was a pause while Murray wrote this down. 
"Good enough for me, Arthur, good enough for Ethel and me and the chickens. Fits in with the general weirdness of the week. Week of the Weirdos, we're thinking of calling it. Good, eh?" 
"Very good."â¨"Got a ring to it. First we have this man it always rains on." "What?" 
"It's the absolute stocking top truth. All documented in his little black book, it all checks out at every single funloving level. The Met Office is going ice cold thick banana whips, and funny little men in white coats are flying in from all over the world with their little rulers and boxes and drip feeds. This man is the bee's knees, Arthur, he is the wasp's nipples. He is, I would go so far as to say, the entire set of erogenous zones of every major flying insect of the Western world. We're calling him the Rain God. Nice, eh?" 
"I think I've met him." 
"Good ring to it. What did you say?" 
"I may have met him. Complains all the time, yes?" 
"Incredible! You met the Rain God?" 
"If it's the same guy. I told him to stop complaining and show someone his book." 
There was an impressed pause from Murray Bost Henson's end of the phone. 
"Well, you did a bundle. An absolute bundle has absolutely been done by you. Listen, do you know how much a tour operator is paying that guy not to go to Malaga this year? I mean forget irrigating the Sahara and boring stuff like that, this guy has a whole new career 
ahead of him, just avoiding places for money. The man's turning into a monster, Arthur, we might even have to make him win the bingo. 
"Listen, we may want to do a feature on you, Arthur, the Man Who Made the Rain God Rain. Got a ring to it, eh?" 
"A nice one, but..." 
"We may need to photograph you under a garden shower, but that'll be OK. Where are you?" 
"Er, I'm in Islington. Listen, Murray..." 
"Islington!" 
"Yes..." 
"Well, what about the real weirdness of the week, the real seriously loopy stuff. You know anything about these flying people?" 
"No." 
"You must have. This is the real seethingly crazy one. This is the real meatballs in the batter. Locals are phoning in all the time to say there's this couple who go flying nights. We've got guys down in our photo labs working through the night to put together a genuine photograph. You must have heard." 
"No." 
"Arthur, where have you been? Oh, space, right, I got your quote. But that was months ago. Listen, it's night after night this week, my old cheesegrater, right on your patch. This couple just fly around the sky and start doing all kinds of stuff. And I don't mean looking through walls or pretending to be box girder bridges. You don't know anything?" 
"No." 
"Arthur, it's been almost inexpressibly delicious conversing with you, chumbum, but I have to go. I'll send the guy with the camera and the hose. Give me the address, I'm ready and writing." 
"Listen, Murray, I called to ask you something."â¨"I have a lot to do."â¨"I just wanted to find out something about the dolphins." "No story. Last year's news. Forget 'em. They're gone." "It's important." 
"Listen, no one will touch it. You can't sustain a story, you know, when the only news is the continuing absence of whatever the story's 
about. Not our territory anyway, try the Sundays. Maybe they'll run a little 'Whatever Happened to "Whatever Happened to the Dolphins"' story in a couple of years, around August. But what's anybody going to do now? 'Dolphins still gone'? 'Continuing Dolphin Absence'? 'Dolphins Further Days Without Them'? The story dies, Arthur. It lies down and kicks its little feet in the air and presently goes to the great golden spike in the sky, my old fruitbat." 
"Murray, I'm not interested in whether it's a story. I just want to find out how I can get in touch with that guy in California who claims to know something about it. I thought you might know." 
Chapter 28 
"People are beginning to talk," said Fenchurch that evening, after they had hauled her 'cello in. 
"Not only talk," said Arthur, "but print, in big bold letters under the bingo prizes. Which is why I thought I'd better get these." 
He showed her the long narrow booklets of airline tickets. 
"Arthur!" she said, hugging him. "Does that mean you managed to talk to him?" 
"I have had a day," said Arthur, "of extreme telephonic exhaustion. I have spoken to virtually every department of virtually every paper in Fleet street, and I finally tracked his number down." 
"You've obviously been working hard, you're drenched with sweat poor darling." 
"Not with sweat," said Arthur wearily. "A photographer's just been. I tried to argue, but never mind, the point is, yes." 
"You spoke to him." 
"I spoke to his wife. She said he was too weird to come to the phone right now and could I call back." 
He sat down heavily, realized he was missing something and went to the fridge to find it. 
"Want a drink?" 
"Would commit murder to get one. I always know I'm in for a tough time when my 'cello teacher looks me up and down and says, 'Ah yes, my dear, I think a little Tchaikovsky today.'." 
"I called again," said Arthur, "and she said that he was 3.2 light years from the phone and I should call back." 
"Ah." 
"I called again. "She said the situation had improved. He was now a mere 2.6 light years from the phone but it was still a long way to shout." 
"You don't suppose," said Fenchurch, doubtfully, "that there's anyone else we can talk to?" 
"It gets worse," said Arthur, "I spoke to someone on a science magazine who actually knows him, and he said that John Watson will not only believe, but will actually have absolute proof, often dictated to him by angels with golden beards and green wings and Doctor Scholl footwear, that the month's most fashionable silly theory is true. For people who question the validity of these visions he will triumphantly produce the clogs in question, and that's as far as you get." 
"I didn't realize it was that bad," said Fenchurch quietly. She fiddled listlessly with the tickets. 
"I phoned Mrs. Watson again," said Arthur. "Her name, by the way, and you may wish to know this, is Arcane Jill." 
"I see." 
"I'm glad you see. I thought you mightn't believe any of this, so when I called her this time I used the telephone answering machine to record the call." 
He went across to the telephone machine and fiddled and fumed with all its buttons for a while, because it was the one which was particularly recommended by Which magazine and is almost impossible to use without going mad. 
"Here it is," he said at last, wiping the sweat from his brow. 
The voice was thin and crackly with its journey to a geostationary satellite and back, but it was also hauntingly calm. 
"Perhaps I should explain," Arcane Jill Watson's voice said, "that the phone is in fact in a room that he never comes into. It's in the Asylum you see. Wonko the Sane does not like to enter the Asylum and so he does not. I feel you should know this because it may save you phoning. If you would like to meet him, this is very easily arranged. All you have to do is walk in. He will only meet people outside the Asylum." 
Arthur's voice, at its most mystified: "I'm sorry, I don't understand. Where is the asylum?" 
"Where is the Asylum?" Arcane Jill Watson again. "Have you ever read the instructions on a packet of toothpicks?" 
On the tape, Arthur's voice had to admit that he had not. 
"You may want to do that. You may find that it clarifies things for you a little. You may find that it indicates to you where the Asylum is. Thank you." 
The sound of the phone line went dead. Arthur turned the machine off. 
"Well, I suppose we can regard that as an invitation," he said with a shrug. "I actually managed to get the address from the guy on the science magazine." 
Fenchurch looked up at him again with a thoughtful frown, and looked at the tickets again. 
"Do you think it's worth it?" she said. 
"Well," said Arthur, "the one thing that everyone I spoke to agrees on, apart from the fact that they all thought he was barking mad, is that he does know more than any man living about dolphins." 
Chapter 29 
"This is an important announcement. This is flight 121 to Los Angeles. If your travel plans today do not include Los Angeles, now would be the perfect time to disembark." 
Chapter 30 
They rented a car in Los Angeles from one of the places that rents out cars that other people have thrown away. 
"Getting it to go round corners is a bit of a problem," said the guy behind the sunglasses as he handed them the keys, "sometimes it's simpler just to get out and find a car that's going in that direction." 
They stayed for one night in a hotel on Sunset Boulevard which someone had told them they would enjoy being puzzled by. 
"Everyone there is either English or odd or both. They've got a swimming pool where you can go and watch English rock stars reading Language, Truth and Logic for the photographers." 
It was true. There was one and that was exactly what he was doing. 
The garage attendant didn't think much of their car, but that was fine because they didn't either. 
Late in the evening they drove through the Hollywood hills along Mulholland Drive and stopped to look out first over the dazzling sea of floating light that is Los Angeles, and later stopped to look across the dazzling sea of floating light that is the San Fernando Valley. They agreed that the sense of dazzle stopped immediately at the back of their eyes and didn't touch any other part of them and came away strangely unsatisfied by the spectacle. As dramatic seas of light went, it was fine, but light is meant to illuminate something, and having driven through what this particularly dramatic sea of light was illuminating they didn't think much of it. 
They slept late and restlessly and awoke at lunchtime when it was stupidly hot. 
They drove out along the freeway to Santa Monica for their first look at the Pacific Ocean, the ocean which Wonko the Sane spent all his days and a good deal of his nights looking at. 
"Someone told me," said Fenchurch, "that they once overheard two old ladies on this beach, doing what we're doing, looking at the Pacific Ocean for the first time in their lives. And apparently, after a 
long pause, one of them said to the other, 'You know, it's not as big as I expected.'" 
Their mood lifted further as the sun began to move down the western half of the sky, and by the time they were back in their rattling car and driving towards a sunset that no one of any sensibility would dream of building a city like Los Angeles on front of, they were suddenly feeling astonishingly and irrationally happy and didn't even mind that the terrible old car radio would only play two stations, and those simultaneously. So what, they were both playing good rock and roll. 
"I know he will be able to help us," said Fenchurch determinedly. "I know he will. What's his name again, that he likes to be called?" 
"Wonko the Sane." 
"I know that he will be able to help us." 
Arthur wondered if he would and hoped that he would, and hoped that what Fenchurch had lost could be found here, on this Earth, whatever this Earth might prove to be. 
He hoped, as he had hoped continually and fervently since the time they had talked together on the banks of the Serpentine, that he would not be called upon to try to remember something that he had very firmly and deliberately buried in the furthest recesses of his memory, where he hoped it would cease to nag at him. 
In Santa Barbara they stopped at a fish restaurant in what seemed to be a converted warehouse. 
Fenchurch had red mullet and said it was delicious.â¨Arthur had a swordfish steak and said it made him angry. He grabbed a passing waitress by the arm and berated her. "Why's this fish so bloody good?" he demanded, angrily. 
"Please excuse my friend," said Fenchurch to the startled waitress. "I think he's having a nice day at last." 
Chapter 31 
If you took a couple of David Bowies and stuck one of the David Bowies on the top of the other David Bowie, then attached another David Bowie to the end of each of the arms of the upper of the first two David Bowies and wrapped the whole business up in a dirty beach robe you would then have something which didn't exactly look like John Watson, but which those who knew him would find hauntingly familiar. 
He was tall and he gangled. 
When he sat in his deckchair gazing at the Pacific, not so much with any kind of wild surmise any longer as with a peaceful deep dejection, it was a little difficult to tell exactly where the deckchair ended and he began, and you would hesitate to put your hand on, say, his forearm in case the whole structure suddenly collapsed with a snap and took your thumb off. 
But his smile when he turned it on you was quite remarkable. It seemed to be composed of all the worst things that life can do to you, but which, when he briefly reassembled them in that particular order on his face, made you suddenly fee, "Oh. Well that's all right then." 
When he spoke, you were glad that he used the smile that made you feel like that pretty often. 
"Oh yes," he said, "they come and see me. They sit right here. They sit right where you're sitting." 
He was talking of the angels with the golden beards and green wings and Dr. Scholl sandals. 
"They eat nachos which they say they can't get where they come from. They do a lot of coke and are very wonderful about a whole range of things." 
"Do they?" said Arthur. "Are they? So, er... when is this then? When do they come?" 
He gazed out at the Pacific as well. There were little sandpipers running along the margin of the shore which seemed to have this 
problem: they needed to find their food in the sand which a wave had just washed over, but they couldn't bear to get their feet wet. To deal with this problem they ran with an odd kind of movement as if they'd been constructed by somebody very clever in Switzerland. 
Fenchurch was sitting on the sand, idly drawing patterns in it with her fingers. 
"Weekends, mostly," said Wonko the Sane, "on little scooters. They are great machines." He smiled. 
"I see," said Arthur. "I see." 
A tiny cough from Fenchurch attracted his attention and he looked round at her. She had scratched a little stick figure drawing in the sand of the two of them in the clouds. For a moment he thought she was trying to get him excited, then he realized that she was rebuking him. "Who are we," she was saying, "to say he's mad?" 
His house was certainly peculiar, and since this was the first thing that Fenchurch and Arthur had encountered it would help to know what it was like. 
What it was like was this: 
It was inside out. 
Actually inside out, to the extent that they had to park on the carpet. 
All along what one would normally call the outer wall, which was decorated in a tasteful interior-designed pink, were bookshelves, also a couple of those odd three-legged tables with semi-circular tops which stand in such a way as to suggest that someone just dropped the wall straight through them, and pictures which were clearly designed to soothe. 
Where it got really odd was the roof. 
It folded back on itself like something that Maurits C. Escher, had he been given to hard nights on the town, which is no part of this narrative's purpose to suggest was the case, though it is sometimes hard, looking at his pictures, particularly the one with the awkward steps, not to wonder, might have dreamed up after having been on one, for the little chandeliers which should have been hanging inside were on the outside pointing up. 
Confusing. 
The sign above the front door said, "Come Outside", and so, nervously, they had. 
Inside, of course, was where the Outside was. Rough brickwork, nicely done painting, guttering in good repair, a garden path, a couple of small trees, some rooms leading off. 
And the inner walls stretched down, folded curiously, and opened at the end as if, by an optical illusion which would have had Maurits C. Escher frowning and wondering how it was done, to enclose the Pacific Ocean itself. 
"Hello," said John Watson, Wonko the Sane. 
Good, they thought to themselves, "Hello" is something we can cope with. 
"Hello," they said, and all surprisingly was smiles. 
For quite a while he seemed curiously reluctant to talk about the dolphins, looking oddly distracted and saying, "I forget..." whenever they were mentioned, and had shown them quite proudly round the eccentricities of his house. 
"It gives me pleasure," he said, "in a curious kind of way, and does nobody any harm," he continued, "that a competent optician couldn't correct." 
They liked him. He had an open, engaging quality and seemed able to mock himself before anybody else did. 
"Your wife," said Arthur, looking around, "mentioned some toothpicks." He said it with a hunted look, as if he was worried that she might suddenly leap out from behind the door and mention them again. 
Wonko the Sane laughed. It was a light easy laugh, and sounded like one he had used a lot before and was happy with. 
"Ah yes," he said, "that's to so with the day I finally realized that the world had gone totally mad and built the Asylum to put it in, poor thing, and hoped it would get better." 
This was the point at which Arthur began to feel a little nervous again. 
"Here," said Wonko the Sane, "we are outside the Asylum." He pointed again at the rough brickwork, the pointing and the guttering. "Go through that door," he pointed at the first door through which they had originally entered, "and you go into the Asylum. I've tried to 
decorate it nicely to keep the inmates happy, but there's very little one can do. I never go in there now myself. If ever I am tempted, which these days I rarely am, I simply look at the sign written over the door and shy away." 
"That one?" said Fenchurch, pointing, rather puzzled, at a blue plaque with some instructions written on it. 
"Yes. They are the words that finally turned me into the hermit I have now become. It was quite sudden. I saw them, and I knew what I had to do." 
The sign said: 
Hold stick near centre of its length. Moisten pointed end in mouth. Insert in tooth space, blunt end next to gum. Use gentle in-out motion. 
"It seemed to me," said Wonko the sane, "that any civilization that had so far lost its head as to need to include a set of detailed instructions for use in a packet of toothpicks, was no longer a civilization in which I could live and stay sane." 
He gazed out at the Pacific again, as if daring it to rave and gibber at him, but it lay there calmly and played with the sandpipers. 
"And in case it crossed your mind to wonder, as I can see how it possibly might, I am completely sane. Which is why I call myself Wonko the Sane, just to reassure people on this point. Wonko is what my mother called me when I was a kid and clumsy and knocked things over, and sane is what I am, and how," he added, with one of his smiles that made you feel, "Oh. Well that's all right then." "I intend to remain. Shall we go on to the beach and see what we have to talk about?" 
They went out on to the beach, which was where he started talking about angels with golden beards and green wings and Dr. Scholl sandals. 
"About the dolphins..." said Fenchurch gently, hopefully. "I can show you the sandals," said Wonko the Sane.â¨"I wonder, do you know..." 
"Would you like me to show you," said Wonko the Sane, "the sandals? I have them. I'll get them. They are made by the Dr. Scholl company, and the angels say that they particularly suit the terrain they have to work in. They say they run a concession stand by the 
message. When I say I don't know what that means they say no, you don't, and laugh. Well, I'll get them anyway." 
As he walked back towards the inside, or the outside depending on how you looked at it, Arthur and Fenchurch looked at each other in a wondering and slightly desperate sort of way, then each shrugged and idly drew figures in the sand. 
"How are the feet today?" said Arthur quietly. 
"OK. It doesn't feel so odd in the sand. Or in the water. The water touches them perfectly. I just think this isn't our world." 
She shrugged. 
"What do you think he meant," she said, "by the message?" 
"I don't know," said Arthur, though the memory of a man called Prak who laughed at him continuously kept nagging at him. 
When Wonko returned he was carrying something that stunned Arthur. Not the sandals, they were perfectly ordinary wooden- bottomed sandals. 
"I just thought you'd like to see," he said, "what angels wear on their feet. Just out of curiousity. I'm not trying to prove anything, by the way. I'm a scientist and I know what constitutes proof. But the reason I call myself by my childhood name is to remind myself that a scientist must also be absolutely like a child. If he sees a thing, heâ¨must say that he sees it, whether it was what he thought he wasâ¨going to see or not. See first, think later, then test. But always see first. Otherwise you will only see what you were expecting. Most scientists forget that. I'll show you something to demonstrate that later. So, the other reason I call myself Wonko the Sane is so that people will think I am a fool. That allows me to say what I see when I see it. You can't possibly be a scientist if you mind people thinking that you're a fool. Anyway, I also thought you might like to see this." 
This was the thing that Arthur had been stunned to see him carrying, for it was a wonderful silver-grey glass fish bowl, seemingly identical to the one in Arthur's bedroom. 
Arthur had been trying for some thirty seconds now, without success, to say, "Where did you get that?" sharply, and with a gasp in his voice. 
Finally his time had come, but he missed it by a millisecond. 
"Where did you get that?" said Fenchurch, sharply and with a gasp in her voice. 
Arthur glanced at Fenchurch sharply and with a gasp in his voice said, "What? Have you seen one of these before?" 
"Yes," she said, "I've got one. Or at least I did have. Russell nicked it to put his golfballs in. I don't know where it came from, just that I was angry with Russell for nicking it. Why, have you got one?" 
"Yes, it was..." 
They both became aware that Wonko the Sane was glancing sharply backwards and forwards between them, and trying to get a gasp in edgeways. 
"You have one of those too?" he said to both of them. 
"Yes." They both said it. 
He looked long and calmly at each of them, then he held up the bowl to catch the light of the Californian sun. 
The bowl seemed almost to sing with the sun, to chime with the intensity of its light, and cast darkly brilliant rainbows around the sand and upon them. He turned it, and turned it. They could see quite clearly in the fine tracery of its etchwork the words "So Long, and Thanks For All The Fish." 
"Do you know," asked Wonko quietly, "what it is?" 
They each shook their heads slowly, and with wonder, almost hypnotized by the flashing of the lightning shadows in the grey glass. 
"It is a farewell gift from the dolphins," said Wonko in a low quiet voice, "the dolphins whom I loved and studied, and swam with, and fed with fish, and even tried to learn their language, a task which they seemed to make impossibly difficult, considering the fact that I now realize they were perfectly capable of communicating in ours if they decided they wanted to." 
He shook his head with a slow, slow smile, and then looked again at Fenchurch, and then at Arthur. 
"Have you..." he said to Arthur, "what have you done with yours? May I ask you that?" 
"Er, I keep a fish in it," said Arthur, slightly embarrassed. "I happened to have this fish I was wondering what to do with, and, er, there was this bowl." He tailed off. 
"You've done nothing else? No," he said, "if you had, you would know." He shook his head again. 
"My wife kept wheatgerm in ours," resumed Wonko, with some new tone in his voice, "until last night..." 
"What," said Arthur slowly and hushedly, "happened last night?" 
"We ran out of wheatgerm," said Wonko, evenly. "My wife," he added, "has gone to get some more." He seemed lost with his own thoughts for a moment. 
"And what happened then?" said Fenchurch, in the same breathless tone. 
"I washed it," said Wonko. "I washed it very carefully, very very carefully, removing every last speck of wheatgerm, then I dried it slowly with a lint-free cloth, slowly, carefully, turning it over and over. Then I held it to my ear. Have you... have you held one to your ear?" 
They both shook their heads, again slowly, again dumbly. "Perhaps," he said, "you should." 
Chapter 32 
The deep roar of the ocean. 
The break of waves on further shores than thought can find. 
The silent thunders of the deep. 
And from among it, voices calling, and yet not voices, humming trillings, wordlings, the half-articulated songs of thought. 
Greetings, waves of greetings, sliding back down into the inarticulate, words breaking together. 
A crash of sorrow on the shores of Earth. 
Waves of joy on where? A world indescribably found, indescribably arrived at, indescribably wet, a song of water. 
A fugue of voices now, clamouring explanations, of a disaster unavertable, a world to be destroyed, a surge of helplessness, a spasm of despair, a dying fall, again the break of words. 
And then the fling of hope, the finding of a shadow Earth in the implications of enfolded time, submerged dimensions, the pull of parallels, the deep pull, the spin of will, the hurl and split of it, the flight. A new Earth pulled into replacement, the dolphins gone. 
Then stunningly a single voice, quite clear. 
"This bowl was brought to you by the Campaign to Save the Humans. We bid you farewell." 
And then the sound of long, heavy, perfectly grey bodies rolling away into an unknown fathomless deep, quietly giggling. 
Chapter 33 
That night they stayed Outside the Asylum and watched TV from inside it. 
"This is what I wanted you to see," said Wonko the Sane when the news came around again, "an old colleague of mine. He's over in your country running an investigation. Just watch." 
It was a press conference. 
"I'm afraid I can't comment on the name Rain God at this present time, and we are calling him an example of a Spontaneous Para- Causal Meteorological Phenomenon." 
"Can you tell us what that means?" 
"I'm not altogether sure. Let's be straight here. If we find something we can't understand we like to call it something you can't understand, or indeed pronounce. I mean if we just let you go around calling him a Rain God, then that suggests that you know something we don't, and I'm afraid we couldn't have that. 
"No, first we have to call it something which says it's ours, not yours, then we set about finding some way of proving it's not what you said it is, but something we say it is. 
"And if it turns out that you're right, you'll still be wrong, because we will simply call him a... er 'Supernormal...' not paranormal or supernatural because you think you know what those mean now, no, a 'Supernormal Incremental Precipitation Inducer'. We'll probably want to shove a 'Quasi' in there somewhere to protect ourselves. Rain God! Huh, never heard such nonsense in my life. Admittedly, you wouldn't catch me going on holiday with him. Thanks, that'll be all for now, other than to say 'Hi!' to Wonko if he's watching." 
Chapter 34 
On the way home there was a woman sitting next to them on the plane who was looking at them rather oddly. 
They talked quietly to themselves. 
"I still have to know," said Fenchurch, "and I strongly feel that you know something that you're not telling me." 
Arthur sighed and took out a piece of paper. 
"Do you have a pencil?" he said. She dug around and found one. 
"What are you doing, sweetheart?" she said, after he had spent twenty minutes frowning, chewing the pencil, scribbling on the paper, crossing things out, scribbling again, chewing the pencil again and grunting irritably to himself. 
"Trying to remember an address someone once gave me." 
"Your life would be an awful lot simpler," she said, "if you bought yourself an address book." 
Finally he passed the paper to her. 
"You look after it," he said. 
She looked at it. Among all the scratchings and crossings out were the words "Quentulus Quazgar Mountains. Sevorbeupstry. Planet of Preliumtarn. Sun-Zarss. Galactic Sector QQ7 Active J Gamma." 
"And what's there?" 
"Apparently," said Arthur, "it's God's Final Message to His Creation." 
"That sounds a bit more like it," said Fenchurch. "How do we get there?" 
"You really...?" 
"Yes," said Fenchurch firmly, "I really want to know." 
Arthur looked out of the scratchy little perspex window at the open sky outside. 
"Excuse me," said the woman who had been looking at them rather oddly, suddenly, "I hope you don't think I'm rude. I get so bored on these long flights, it's nice to talk to somebody. My name's Enid Kapelsen, I'm from Boston. Tell me, do you fly a lot?" 
Chapter 35 
They went to Arthur's house in the West Country, shoved a couple of towels and stuff in a bag, and then sat down to do what every Galactic hitch hiker ends up spending most of his time doing. 
They waited for a flying saucer to come by. 
"Friend of mine did this for fifteen years," said Arthur one night as they sat forlornly watching the sky. 
"Who was that?" 
"Called Ford Prefect." 
He caught himself doing something he had never really expected to do again. 
He wondered where Ford Prefect was. 
By an extraordinary coincidence, the following day there were two reports in the paper, one concerning the most astonishing incidents with a flying saucer, and the other about a series of unseemly riots in pubs. 
Ford Prefect turned up the day after that looking hung over and complaining that Arthur never answered the phone. 
In fact he looked extremely ill, not merely as if he'd been pulled through a hedge backwards, but as if the hedge was being simultaneously pulled backwards through a combine harvester. He staggered into Arthur's sitting room, waving aside all offers of support, which was an error, because the effort caused him to lose his balance altogether and Arthur had eventually to drag him to the sofa. 
"Thank you," said Ford, "thank you very much. Have you..." he said, and fell asleep for three hours. 
"... the faintest idea" he continued suddenly, when he revived,â¨"how hard it is to tap into the British phone system from the Pleiades? I can see that you haven't, so I'll tell you," he said, "over the very large mug of black coffee that you are about to make me." 
He followed Arthur wobbily into the kitchen. 
"Stupid operators keep asking you where you're calling from and you try and tell them Letchworth and they say you couldn't be if you're coming in on that circuit. What are you doing?" 
"Making you some black coffee." 
"Oh." Ford seemed oddly disappointed. He looked about the place forlornly. 
"What's this?" he said. "Rice Crispies."â¨"And this?"â¨"Paprika." 
"I see," said Ford, solemnly, and put the two items back down, one on top of the other, but that didn't seem to balance properly, so he put the other on top of the one and that seemed to work. 
"A little space-lagged," he said. "What was I saying?" 
"About not phoning from Letchworth." 
"I wasn't. I explained this to the lady. 'Bugger Letchworth,' I said, 'if that's your attitude. I am in fact calling from a sales scoutship of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation, currently on the sub-light-speed leg of a journey between the stars known on your world, though not necessarily to you, dear lady.' I said 'dear lady'," explained Ford Prefect, "because I didn't want her to be offended by my implication that she was an ignorant cretin..." 
"Tactful," said Arthur Dent. "Exactly," said Ford, "tactful." He frowned. 
"Space-lag," he said, "is very bad for sub-clauses. You'll have to assist me again," he continued, "by reminding me what I was talking about." 
"'Between the stars,'" said Arthur, "'known on your world, though not necessarily to you, dear lady, as...'" 
"'Pleiades Epsilon and Pleiades Zeta,'" concluded Ford triumphantly. "This conversation lark is quite gas isn't it?" 
"Have some coffee." 
"Thank you, no. 'And the reason,' I said, 'why I am bothering you with it rather than just dialling direct as I could, because we have some pretty sophisticated telecommunications equipment out here in 
the Pleiades, I can tell you, is that the penny pinching son of a starbeast piloting this son of a starbeast spaceship insists that I call collect. Can you believe that?'" 
"And could she?" 
"I don't know. She had hung up," said Ford, "by this time. So! What do you suppose," he asked fiercely, "I did next?" 
"I've no idea, Ford," said Arthur. 
"Pity," said Ford, "I was hoping you could remind me. I really hate those guys you know. They really are the creeps of the cosmos, buzzing around the celestial infinite with their junky little machines that never work properly or, when they do, perform functions that no sane man would require of them and," he added savagely, "go beep to tell you when they've done it!" 
This was perfectly true, and a very respectable view widely held by right thinking people, who are largely recognizable as being right thinking people by the mere fact that they hold this view. 
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, in a moment of reasoned lucidity which is almost unique among its current tally of five million, nine hundred and seventy-five thousand, five hundred and nine pages, says of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation product that "it is very easy to be blinded to the essential uselessness of them by the sense of achievement you get from getting them to work at all. 
"In other words and this is the rock solid principle on which the whole of the Corporation's Galaxy-wide success is founded their fundamental design flaws are completely hidden by their superficial design flaws." 
"And this guy," ranted Ford, "was on a drive to sell more of them! His five-year mission to seek out and explore strange new worlds, and sell Advanced Music Substitute Systems to their restaurants, elevators and wine bars! Or if they didn't have restaurants, elevators and wine bars yet, to artificially accelerate their civilization growth until they bloody well did have! Where's that coffee!" 
"I threw it away." 
"Make some more. I have now remembered what I did next. I saved civilization as we know it. I knew it was something like that." 
He stumbled determinedly back into the sitting room, where he seemed to carry on talking to himself, tripping over the furniture and making beep beep noises. 
A couple of minutes later, wearing his very placid face, Arthur followed him. 
Ford looked stunned. 
"Where have you been?" he demanded. 
"Making some coffee," said Arthur, still wearing his very placid face. He had long ago realized that the only way of being in Ford's company successfully was to keep a large stock of very placid faces and wear them at all times. 
"You missed the best bit!" raged Ford. "You missed the bit where I jumped the guy! Now," he said, "I shall have to jump him, all over him!" 
He hurled himself recklessly at a chair and broke it. 
"It was better," he said sullenly, "last time," and waved vaguely in the direction of another broken chair which he had already got trussed up on the dining table. 
"I see," said Arthur, casting a placid eye over the trussed up wreckage, "and, er, what are all the ice cubes for?" 
"What?" screamed Ford. "What? You missed that bit too? That's the suspended animation facility! I put the guy in the suspended animation facility. Well I had to didn't I?" 
"So it would seem," said Arthur, in his placid voice. 
"Don't touch that!!!" yelled Ford. 
Arthur, who was about to replace the phone, which was for some mysterious reason lying on the table, off the hook, paused, placidly. 
"OK," said Ford, calming down, "listen to it." Arthur put the phone to his ear.â¨"It's the speaking clock," he said. 
"Beep, beep, beep," said Ford, "is exactly what is being heard all over that guy's ship, while he sleeps, in the ice, going slowly round a little-known moon of Sesefras Magna. The London Speaking Clock!" 
"I see," said Arthur again, and decided that now was the time to ask the big one. 
"Why?" he said, placidly. 
"With a bit of luck," said Ford, "the phone bill will bankrupt the buggers." 
He threw himself, sweating, on to the sofa. "Anyway," he said, "dramatic arrival don't you think?" 
Chapter 36 
The flying saucer in which Ford Prefect had stowed away had stunned the world. 
Finally there was no doubt, no possibility of mistake, no hallucinations, no mysterious CIA agents found floating in reservoirs. 
This time it was real, it was definite. It was quite definitely definite. 
It had come down with a wonderful disregard for anything beneath it and crushed a large area of some of the most expensive real estate in the world, including much of Harrods. 
The thing was massive, nearly a mile across, some said, dull silver in colour, pitted, scorched and disfigured with the scars of unnumbered vicious space battles fought with savage forces by the light of suns unknown to man. 
A hatchway opened, crashed down through the Harrods Food Halls, demolished Harvey Nicholls, and with a final grinding scream of tortured architecture, toppled the Sheraton Park Tower. 
After a long, heart-stopping moment of internal crashes and grumbles of rending machinery, there marched from it, down the ramp, an immense silver robot, a hundred feet tall. 
It held up a hand. 
"I come in peace," it said, adding after a long moment of further grinding, "take me to your Lizard." 
Ford Prefect, of course, had an explanation for this, as he sat with Arthur and watched the non-stop frenetic news reports on the television, none of which had anything to say other than to record that the thing had done this amount of damage which was valued at that amount of billions of pounds and had killed this totally other number of people, and then say it again, because the robot was doing nothing more than standing there, swaying very slightly, and emitting short incomprehensible error messages. 
"It comes from a very ancient democracy, you see..." 
"You mean, it comes from a world of lizards?" 
"No," said Ford, who by this time was a little more rational and coherent than he had been, having finally had the coffee forced down him, "nothing so simple. Nothing anything like so straightforward. On its world, the people are people. The leaders are lizards. The people hate the lizards and the lizards role the people." 
"Odd," said Arthur, "I thought you said it was a democracy." 
"I did," said Ford. "It is." 
"So," said Arthur, hoping he wasn't sounding ridiculously obtuse, "why don't people get rid of the lizards?" 
"It honestly doesn't occur to them," said Ford. "They've all got the vote, so they all pretty much assume that the government they've voted in more or less approximates to the government they want." 
"You mean they actually vote for the lizards?" 
"Oh yes," said Ford with a shrug, "of course." 
"But," said Arthur, going for the big one again, "why?" 
"Because if they didn't vote for a lizard," said Ford, "the wrong lizard might get in. Got any gin?" 
"What?" 
"I said," said Ford, with an increasing air of urgency creeping into his voice, "have you got any gin?" 
"I'll look. Tell me about the lizards." 
Ford shrugged again. 
"Some people say that the lizards are the best thing that ever happened to them," he said. "They're completely wrong of course, completely and utterly wrong, but someone's got to say it." 
"But that's terrible," said Arthur. 
"Listen, bud," said Ford, "if I had one Altairan dollar for every time I heard one bit of the Universe look at another bit of the Universe and say 'That's terrible' I wouldn't be sitting here like a lemon looking for a gin. But I haven't and I am. Anyway, what are you looking so placid and moon-eyed for? Are you in love?" 
Arthur said yes, he was, and said it placidly. 
"With someone who knows where the gin bottle is? Do I get to meet her?" 
He did because Fenchurch came in at that moment with a pile of newspapers she'd been into the village to buy. She stopped in astonishment at the wreckage on the table and the wreckage from Betelgeuse on the sofa. 
"Where's the gin?" said Ford to Fenchurch. And to Arthur, "What happened to Trillian by the way?" 
"Er, this is Fenchurch," said Arthur, awkwardly. "There was nothing with Trillian, you must have seen her last." 
"Oh, yeah," said Ford, "she went off with Zaphod somewhere. They had some kids or something. At least," he added, "I think that's what they were. Zaphod's calmed down a lot you know." 
"Really?" said Arthur, clustering hurriedly round Fenchurch to relieve her of the shopping. 
"Yeah," said Ford, "at least one of his heads is now saner than an emu on acid." 
"Arthur, who is this?" said Fenchurch.â¨"Ford Prefect," said Arthur. "I may have mentioned him in passing." 
Chapter 37 
For a total of three days and nights the giant silver robot stood in stunned amazement straddling the remains of Knightsbridge, swaying slightly and trying to work out a number of things. 
Government deputations came to see it, ranting journalists by the truckload asked each other questions on the air about what they thought of it, flights of fighter bombers tried pathetically to attack it but no lizards appeared. It scanned the horizon slowly. 
At night it was at its most spectacular, floodlit by the teams of television crews who covered it continuously as it continuously did nothing. 
It thought and thought and eventually reached a conclusion. 
It would have to send out its service robots. 
It should have thought of that before, but it was having a number of problems. 
The tiny flying robots came screeching out of the hatchway one afternoon in a terrifying cloud of metal. They roamed the surrounding terrain, frantically attacking some things and defending others. 
One of them at last found a pet shop with some lizards, but it instantly defended the pet shop for democracy so savagely that little in the area survived. 
A turning point came when a crack team of flying screechers discovered the Zoo in Regent's Park, and most particularly the reptile house. 
Learning a little caution from their previous mistakes in the petshop, the flying drills and fretsaws brought some of the larger and fatter iguanas to the giant silver robot, who tried to conduct high- level talks with them. 
Eventually the robot announced to the world that despite the full, frank and wide-ranging exchange of views the high level talks had broken down, the lizards had been retired, and that it, the robot 
would take a short holiday somewhere, and for some reason selected Bournemouth. 
Ford Prefect, watching it on TV, nodded, laughed, and had another beer. 
Immediate preparations were made for its departure. 
The flying toolkits screeched and sawed and drilled and fried things with light throughout that day and all through the night time, and in the morning, stunningly, a giant mobile gantry started to roll westwards on several roads simultaneously with the robot standing on it, supported within the gantry. 
Westward it crawled, like a strange carnival buzzed around by its servants and helicopters and news coaches, scything through the land until at last it came to Bournemouth, where the robot slowly freed itself from it transport system's embraces and went and lay for ten days on the beach. 
It was, of course, by far the most exciting thing that had ever happened to Bournemouth. 
Crowds gathered daily along the perimeter which was staked out and guarded as the robot's recreation area, and tried to see what it was doing. 
It was doing nothing. It was lying on the beach. It was lying a little awkwardly on its face. 
It was a journalist from a local paper who, late one night, managed to do what no one else in the world had so far managed, which was to strike up a brief intelligible conversation with one of the service robots guarding the perimeter. 
It was an extraordinary breakthrough. 
"I think there's a story in it," confided the journalist over a cigarette shared through the steel link fence, "but it needs a good local angle. I've got a little list of questions here," he went on, rummaging awkwardly in an inner pocket, "perhaps you could get him, it, whatever you call him, to run through them quickly." 
The little flying ratchet screwdriver said it would see what it cold do and screeched off. 
A reply was never forthcoming. 
Curiously, however, the questions on the piece of paper more or less exactly matched the questions that were going through the 
massive battle-scarred industrial quality circuits of the robot's mind. They were these: 
"How do you feel about being a robot?"â¨"How does it feel to be from outer space?" and "How do you like Bournemouth?" 
Early the following day things started to be packed up and within a few days it became apparent that the robot was preparing to leave for good. 
"The point is," said Fenchurch to Ford, "can you get us on board?" 
Ford looked wildly at his watch. 
"I have some serious unfinished business to attend to," he exclaimed. 
Chapter 38 
Crowds thronged as close as they could to the giant silver craft, which wasn't very. The immediate perimeter was fenced off and patrolled by the tiny flying service robots. Staked out around that was the army, who had been completely unable to breach that inner perimeter, but were damned if anybody was going to breach them. They in turn were surrounded by a cordon of police, though whether they were there to protect the public from the army or the army from the public, or to guarantee the giant ship's diplomatic immunity and prevent it getting parking tickets was entirely unclear and the subject of much debate. 
The inner perimeter fence was now being dismantled. The army stirred uncomfortably, uncertain of how to react to the fact that the reason for their being there seemed as if it was simply going to get up and go. 
The giant robot had lurched back aboard the ship at lunchtime, and now it was five o'clock in the afternoon and no further sign had been seen of it. Much had been heard more grindings and rumblings from deep within the craft, the music of a million hideous malfunctions; but the sense of tense expectation among the crowd was born of the fact that they tensely expected to be disappointed. This wonderful extraordinary thing had come into their lives, an now it was simply going to go without them. 
Two people were particularly aware of this sensation. Arthur and Fenchurch scanned the crowd anxiously, unable to find Ford Prefect in it anywhere, or any sign that he had the slightest intention of being there. 
"How reliable is he?" asked Fenchurch in a sinking voice. 
"How reliable?" said Arthur. He gave a hollow laugh. "How shallow is the ocean?" he said. "How cold is the sun?" 
The last parts of the robot's gantry transport were being carried on board, and the few remaining sections of the perimeter fence were 
now stacked at the bottom of the ramp waiting to follow them. The soldiers on guard round the ramp bristled meaningfully, orders were barked back and forth, hurried conferences were held, but nothing, of course, could be done about any of it. 
Hopelessly, and with no clear plan now, Arthur and Fenchurch pushed forward through the crowd, but since the whole crowd was also trying to push forward through the crowd, this got them nowhere. 
And within a few minutes more nothing remained outside the ship, every last link of the fence was aboard. A couple of flying fret saws and a spirit level seemed to do one last check around the site, and then screamed in through the giant hatchway themselves. 
A few seconds passed. 
The sounds of mechanical disarray from within changed in intensity, and slowly, heavily, the huge steel ramp began to lift itself back out of the Harrods Food Halls. The sound that accompanied it was the sound of thousands of tense, excited people being completely ignored. 
"Hold it!" 
A megaphone barked from a taxi which screeched to a halt on the edge of the milling crowd. 
"There has been," barked the megaphone, "a major scientific break-in! Through. Breakthrough," it corrected itself. The door flew open and a small man from somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse leapt out wearing a white coat. 
"Hold it!" he shouted again, and this time brandished a short squad black rod with lights on it. The lights winked briefly, the ramp paused in its ascent, and then in obedience to the signals from the Thumb (which half the electronic engineers in the galaxy are constantly trying to find fresh ways of jamming, while the other half are constantly trying to find fresh ways of jamming the jamming signals), slowly ground its way downwards again. 
Ford Prefect grabbed his megaphone from out of the taxi and started bawling at the crowd through it. 
"Make way," he shouted, "make way, please, this is a major scientific breakthrough. You and you, get the equipment from the taxi." 
Completely at random he pointed at Arthur and Fenchurch, who wrestled their way back out of the crowd and clustered urgently round the taxi. 
"All right, I want you to clear a passage, please, for some important pieces of scientific equipment," boomed Ford. "Just everybody keep calm. It's all under control, there's nothing to see. It is merely a major scientific breakthrough. Keep calm now. Important scientific equipment. Clear the way." 
Hungry for new excitement, delighted at this sudden reprieve from disappointment, the crowd enthusiastically fell back and started to open up. 
Arthur was a little surprised to see what was printed on the boxes of important scientific equipment in the back of the taxi. 
"Hang your coat over them," he muttered to Fenchurch as he heaved them out to her. Hurriedly he manoeuvred out the large supermarket trolley that was also jammed against the back seat. It clattered to the ground, and together they loaded the boxes into it. 
"Clear a path, please," shouted Ford again. "Everything's under proper scientific control." 
"He said you'd pay," said the taxi-driver to Arthur, who dug out some notes and paid him. There was the distant sound of police sirens. 
"Move along there," shouted Ford, "and no one will get hurt." 
The crowd surged and closed behind them again, as frantically they pushed and hauled the rattling supermarket trolley through the rubble towards the ramp. 
"It's all right," Ford continued to bellow. "There's nothing to see, it's all over. None of this is actually happening." 
"Clear the way, please," boomed a police megaphone from the back of the crowd. "There's been a break-in, clear the way." 
"Breakthrough," yelled Ford in competition. "A scientific breakthrough!" 
"This is the police! Clear the way!" "Scientific equipment! Clear the way!" "Police! Let us through!" 
"Walkmen!" yelled Ford, and pulled half a dozen miniature tape players from his pockets and tossed them into the crowd. The resulting seconds of utter confusion allowed them to get the supermarket trolley to the edge of the ramp, and to haul it up on to the lip of it. 
"Hold tight," muttered Ford, and released a button on his Electronic Thumb. Beneath them, the huge ramp juddered and began slowly to heave its way upwards. 
"Ok, kids," he said as the milling crowd dropped away beneath them and they started to lurch their way along the tilting ramp into the bowels of the ship, "looks like we're on our way." 
Chapter 39 
Arthur Dent was irritated to be continually wakened by the sound of gunfire. 
Being careful not to wake Fenchurch, who was still managing to sleep fitfully, he slid his way out of the maintenance hatchway which they had fashioned into a kind of bunk for themselves, slung himself down the access ladder and prowled the corridors moodily. 
They were claustrophobic and ill-lit. The lighting circuits buzzed annoyingly. 
This wasn't it, though. 
He paused and leaned backwards as a flying power drill flew past him down the dim corridor with a nasty screech, occasionally clanging against the walls like a confused bee as it did so. 
That wasn't it either. 
He clambered through a bulkhead door and found himself in a larger corridor. Acrid smoke was drifting up from one end so he walked towards the other. 
He came to an observation monitor let into the wall behind a plate of toughened but still badly scratched perspex. 
"Would you turn it down please?" he said to Ford Prefect who was crouching in front of it in the middle of a pile of bits of video equipment he'd taken from a shop window in Tottenham Court Road, having first hurled a small brick through it, and also a nasty heap of empty beer cans. 
"Shhhh!" hissed Ford, and peered with manic concentration at the screen. He was watching The Magnificent Seven. 
"Just a bit," said Arthur. 
"No!" shouted Ford. "We're just getting to the good bit! Listen, I finally got it all sorted out, voltage levels, line conversion, everything, and this is the good bit!" 
With a sigh and a headache, Arthur sat down beside him and watched the good bit. He listened to Ford's whoops and yells and "yeehay!"s as placidly as he could. 
"Ford," he said eventually, when it was all over, and Ford was hunting through a stack of cassettes for the tape of Casablanca, "how come, if..." 
"This is the big one," said Ford. "This is the one I came back for. Do you realize I never saw it all through? Always I missed the end. I saw half of it again the night before the Vogons came. When they blew the place up I thought I'd never get to see it. Hey, what happened with all that anyway?" 
"Just life," said Arthur, and plucked a beer from a six-pack. 
"Oh, that again," said Ford. "I thought it might be something like that. I prefer this stuff," he said as Rick's Bar flickered on to the screen. "How come if what?" 
"What?" 
"You started to say, 'how come if...'" 
"How come if you're so rude about the Earth, that you... oh never mind, let's just watch the movie." 
"Exactly," said Ford. 
Chapter 40 
There remains little still to tell. 
Beyond what used to be known as the Limitless Lightfields of Flanux until the Grey Binding Fiefdoms of Saxaquine were discovered lying behind them, lie the Grey Binding Fiefdoms of Saxaquine. Within the Grey Binding Fiefdoms of Saxaquine lies the star named Zarss, around which orbits the planet Preliumtarn in which is the land of Sevorbeupstry, and it was to the land of Sevorbeupstry that Arthur and Fenchurch came at last, a little tired by the journey. 
And in the land of Sevorbeupstry, they came to the Great Red Plain of Rars, which was bounded on the South side by the Quentulus Quazgar Mountains, on the further side of which, according to the dying words of Prak, they would find in thirty-foot-high letters of fire God's Final Message to His Creation. 
According to Prak, if Arthur's memory saved him right, the place was guarded by the Lajestic Vantrashell of Lob, and so, after a manner, it proved to be. He was a little man in a strange hat and he sold themâ¨a ticket. 
"Keep to the left, please," he said, "keep to the left," and hurried on past them on a little scooter. 
They realized they were not the first to pass that way, for the path that led around the left of the Great Plain was well-worn and dotted with booths. At one they bought a box of fudge, which had been baked in an oven in a cave in the mountain, which was heated by the fire of the letters that formed God's Final Message to His Creation. At another they bought some postcards. The letters had been blurred with an airbrush, "so as not to spoil the Big Surprise!" it said on the reverse. 
"Do you know what the message is?" they asked the wizened little lady in the booth. 
"Oh yes," she piped cheerily, "oh yes!" She waved them on. 
Every twenty miles or so there was a little stone hut with showers and sanitary facilities, but the going was tough, and the high sun baked down on the Great Red Plain, and the Great Red Plain rippled in the heat. 
"Is it possible," asked Arthur at one of the larger booths, "to rent one of those little scooters? Like the one Lajestic Ventrawhatsit had." 
"The scooters," said the little lady who was serving at an ice cream bar, "are not for the devout." 
"Oh well, that's easy then," said Fenchurch, "we're not particularly devout. We're just interested." 
"Then you must turn back now," said the little lady severely, and when they demurred, sold them a couple of Final Message sunhats and a photograph of themselves with their arms tight around each other on the Great Red Plain of Rars. 
They drank a couple of sodas in the shade of the booth and then trudged out into the sun again. 
"We're running out of border cream," said Fenchurch after a few more miles. "We can go to the next booth, or we can return to the previous one which is nearer, but means we have to retrace our steps again." 
They stared ahead at the distant black speck winking in the heat haze; they looked behind themselves. They elected to go on. 
They then discovered that they were not only not the first ones to make this journey, but that they were not the only ones making it now. 
Some way ahead of them an awkward low shape was heaving itself wretchedly along the ground, stumbling painfully slowly, half-limping, half-crawling. 
It was moving so slowly that before too long they caught the creature up and could see that it was made of worn, scarred and twisted metal. 
It groaned at them as they approached it, collapsing in the hot dry dust. 
"So much time," it groaned, "oh so much time. And pain as well, so much of that, and so much time to suffer it in too. One or the other on its own I could probably manage. It's the two together that really get me down. Oh hello, you again." 
"Marvin?" said Arthur sharply, crouching down beside it. "Is that you?" 
"You were always one," groaned the aged husk of the robot, "for the super-intelligent question, weren't you?" 
"What is it?" whispered Fenchurch in alarm, crouching behind Arthur, and grasping on to his arm. "He's sort of an old friend," said Arthur. "I..." 
"Friend!" croaked the robot pathetically. The word died away in a kind of crackle and flakes of rust fell out of its mouth. "You'll have to excuse me while I try and remember what the word means. My memory banks are not what they were you know, and any word which falls into disuse for a few zillion years has to get shifted down into auxiliary memory back-up. Ah, here it comes." 
The robot's battered head snapped up a bit as if in thought. 
"Hmm," he said, "what a curious concept." 
He thought a little longer. 
"No," he said at last, "don't think I ever came across one of those. Sorry, can't help you there." 
He scraped a knee along pathetically in the dust, an then tried to twist himself up on his misshapen elbows. 
"Is there any last service you would like me to perform for you perhaps?" he asked in a kind of hollow rattle. "A piece of paper that perhaps you would like me to pick up for you? Or maybe you would like me," he continued, "to open a door?" 
His head scratched round in its rusty neck bearings and seemed to scan the distant horizon. 
"Don't seem to be any doors around at present," he said, "but I'm sure that if we waited long enough, someone would build one. And then," he said slowly twisting his head around to see Arthur again, "I could open it for you. I'm quite used to waiting you know." 
"Arthur," hissed Fenchurch in his ear sharply, "you never told me of this. What have you done to this poor creature?" 
"Nothing," insisted Arthur sadly, "he's always like this..." 
"Ha!" snapped Marvin. "Ha!" he repeated. "What do you know of always? You say 'always' to me, who, because of the silly little errands your organic lifeforms keep on sending me through time on, am now 
thirty-seven times older than the Universe itself? Pick your words with a little more care," he coughed, "and tact." 
He rasped his way through a coughing fit and resumed. 
"Leave me," he said, "go on ahead, leave me to struggle painfully on my way. My time at last has nearly come. My race is nearly run. I fully expect," he said, feebly waving them on with a broken finger, "to come in last. It would be fitting. Here I am, brain the size..." 
Between them they picked him up despite his feeble protests and insults. The metal was so hot it nearly blistered their fingers, but he weighed surprisingly little, and hung limply between their arms. 
They carried him with them along the path that ran along the left of the Great Red Plain of Rars toward the encircling mountains of Quentulus Quazgar. 
Arthur attempted to explain to Fenchurch, but was too often interrupted by Marvin's dolorous cybernetic ravings. 
They tried to see if they could get him some spare parts at one of the booths, but Marvin would have none of it. 
"I'm all spare parts," he droned. 
"Let me be!" he groaned. 
"Every part of me," he moaned, "has been replaced at least fifty times... except..." He seemed almost imperceptibly to brighten for a moment. His head bobbed between them with the effort of memory. "Do you remember, the first time you ever met me," he said at last to Arthur. "I had been given the intellect-stretching task of taking you up to the bridge? I mentioned to you that I had this terrible pain in all the diodes down my left side? That I had asked for them to be replaced but they never were?" 
He left a longish pause before he continued. They carried him on between them, under the baking sun that hardly ever seemed to move, let alone set. 
"See if you can guess," said Marvin, when he judged that the pause had become embarrassing enough, "which parts of me were never replaced? Go on, see if you can guess. 
"Ouch," he added, "ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch." 
At last they reached the last of the little booths, set down Marvin between them and rested in the shade. Fenchurch bought some cufflinks for Russell, cufflinks that had set in them little polished 
pebbles which had been picked up from the Quentulus Quazgar Mountains, directly underneath the letters of fire in which was written God's Final Message to His Creation. 
Arthur flipped through a little rack of devotional tracts on the counter, little meditations on the meaning of the Message. 
"Ready?" he said to Fenchurch, who nodded. 
They heaved up Marvin between them. 
They rounded the foot of the Quentulus Quazgar Mountains, and there was the Message written in blazing letters along the crest of the Mountain. There was a little observation vantage point with a rail built along the top of a large rock facing it, from which you could get a good view. It had a little pay-telescope for looking at the letters in detail, but no one would ever use it because the letters burned with the divine brilliance of the heavens and would, if seen through a telescope, have severely damaged the retina and optic nerve. 
They gazed at God's Final Message in wonderment, and were slowly and ineffably filled with a great sense of peace, and of final and complete understanding. 
Fenchurch sighed. "Yes," she said, "that was it." 
They had been staring at it for fully ten minutes before they became aware that Marvin, hanging between their shoulders, was in difficulties. The robot could no longer lift his head, had not read the message. They lifted his head, but he complained that his vision circuits had almost gone. 
They found a coin and helped him to the telescope. He complained and insulted them, but they helped him look at each individual letter in turn, The first letter was a "w", the second an "e". Then there was a gap. An "a" followed, then a "p", an "o" and an "l". 
Marvin paused for a rest. 
After a few moments they resumed and let him see the "o", the "g", the "i", the "s" and the "e". 
The next two words were "for" and "the". The last one was a long one, and Marvin needed another rest before he could tackle it. 
It started with an "i", then "n" then a "c". Next came an "o" and an "n", followed by a "v", an "e", another "n" and an "i". 
After a final pause, Marvin gathered his strength for the last stretch. 
He read the "e", the "n", the "c" and at last the final "e", and staggered back into their arms. 
"I think," he murmured at last, from deep within his corroding rattling thorax, "I feel good about it." 
The lights went out in his eyes for absolutely the very last time ever. 
Luckily, there was a stall nearby where you could rent scooters from guys with green wings. 
Epilogue: 
One of the greatest benefactors of all lifekind was a man who couldn't keep his mind on the job in hand. 
Brilliant? 
Certainly. 
One of the foremost genetic engineers of his or any other generation, including a number he had designed himself? 
Without a doubt. 
The problem was that he was far too interested in things which he shouldn't be interested in, at least, as people would tell him, not now. 
He was also, partly because of this, of a rather irritable disposition. 
So when his world was threatened by terrible invaders from a distant star, who were still a fair way off but travelling fast, he, Blart Versenwald III (his name was Blart Versenwald III, which is not strictly relevant, but quite interesting because never mind, that was his name and we can talk about why it's interesting later), was sent into guarded seclusion by the masters of his race with instructions to design a breed of fanatical superwarriors to resist and vanquish the feared invaders, do it quickly and, they told him, "Concentrate!" 
So he sat by a window and looked out at a summer lawn and designed and designed and designed, but inevitably got a little distracted by things, and by the time the invaders were practically in orbit round them, had come up with a remarkable new breed of super-fly that could, unaided, figure out how to fly through the open half of a half-open window, and also an off-switch for children. Celebrations of these remarkable achievements seemed doomed to be shortlived because disaster was imminent as the alien ships were landing. But astoundingly, the fearsome invaders who, like most warlike races were only on the rampage because they couldn't cope with things at home, were stunned by Versenwald's extraordinary breakthroughs, joined in the celebrations and were instantly prevailed upon to sign a wide-ranging series of trading agreements and set up a 
programme of cultural exchanges. And, in an astonishing reversal of normal practice in the conduct of such matters, everybody concerned lived happily ever after. 
There was a point to this story, but it has temporarily escaped the chronicler's mind. 
DOUGLAS ADAMS 
YOUNG ZAPHOD PLAYS IT SAFE 
A large flying craft moved swiftly across the surface of an astoundingly beautiful sea. From mid-morning onward it plied back and forth in great widening arcs, and at last attracted the attention of the local islanders' a peaceful, sea-food-loving people who gathered on the beach and squinted up into the blinding sun, trying to see what was there. 
Any sophisticated knowledgeable person, who had knocked about, seen a few things, would probably have remarked on how much the craft looked like a filing cabinet a large and recently burgled filing cabinet lying on its back with its drawers in the air and flying. 
The islanders, whose experience was of a different kind, were instead struck by how little it looked like a lobster. 
They chattered excitedly about its total lack of claws, its stiff unbending back, and the fact that it seemed to experience the greatest difficulty staying on the ground. This last feature seemed particularly funny to them. They jumped up and down on the spot a lot to demonstrate to the stupid thing that they themselves found staying on the ground the easiest thing in the world. 
But soon this entertainment began to pall for them. After all, since it was perfectly clear to them that the thing was not a lobster, and since their world was blessed with an abundance of things that were lobsters (a good half dozen of which were now marching succulently up the beach toward them), they saw no reason to waste any more time on the thing but decided instead to adjourn immediately for a late lobster lunch. 
At that exact moment the craft stopped suddenly in mid-air, then upended itself and plunged headlong into the ocean with a great crash of spray which sent them shouting into the trees. 
When they reemerged, nervously, a few minutes later, all they were able to see was a smoothly scarred circle of water and a few gulping bubbles. 
That's odd, they said to each other between mouthfuls of the best lobster to be had anywhere in the Western Galaxy, that's the second time that's happened in a year. 
The craft which wasn't a lobster dived direct to a depth of two hundred feet, and hung there in the heavy blueness, while vast masses of water swayed about it. High above, where the water was magically clear, a brilliant formation of fish flashed away. Below, where the light had difficulty reaching, the color of the water sank to a dark and savage. 
Here, at two hundred feet, the sun streamed feebly. A large, silk- skinned sea-mammal rolled idly by, inspecting the craft with a kind of half interest, as if it had half expected to find something of this kind around about here, and then it slid on up and away toward the rippling light. 
The craft waited for a minute or two, taking readings, and then descended another hundred feet. At this depth it was becoming seriously dark. After a moment or two the internal lights of the craft shut down, an 
in the second or so that passed before the main external beams suddenly; stabbed out, the only visible light came from a small hazily illuminated pink sign which read The Beeblebrox Salvage and Really Wild Stuff Corporation. 
The huge beams switched downward, catching a vast shoal of silver fish which swiveled away in silent panic. 
In the dim control room, which extended in a broad bow from the craft's blunt prow, four heads were gathered around a computer display that was analyzing the very, very faint and intermittent signals that emanated from deep on the sea bed. 
"That's it," said the owner of one of the heads finally.â¨"Can we be quite sure?" said the owner of another of the heads. "One hundred percent positive," replied the owner of the first head. 
"You're one hundred percent positive that the ship which is crashed on the bottom of this ocean is the ship which you said you were one hundred percent positive could one hundred percent positively never crash?" said the owner of the two remaining heads. "Hey," he put up two of his hands, "I'm only asking." 
The two officials from the Safety and Civil Reassurance Administration responded to this with a very cold stare, but the man with the odd, or rather the even, number of heads missed it. He flung himself back on the pilot couch, opened a couple of beers one for himself and the other also for himself stuck his feet on the console and said "Hey, baby" through the ultra-glass at a passing fish. 
"Mr. Beeblebrox..." began the shorter and less reassuring of the two officials in a low voice. 
"Yup?" said Zaphod, rapping a suddenly empty can down on some of the more sensitive instruments. "You ready to dive; Let's go." 
"Mr. Beeblebrox, let us make one thing perfectly clear..." 
"Yeah let's," said Zaphod. "How about this for a start. Why don't you just tell me what's really on this ship." 
"We have told you," said the official. "By-products." Zaphod exchanged weary glances with himself. "By-products," he said. "By-products of what?" "Processes," said the official. 
"What processes?" 
"Processes that are perfectly safe." 
"Santa Zarquana Voostra!" exclaimed both of Zaphod's heads in chorus. "So safe that you have to build a zarking fortress ship to take the byproducts to the nearest black hole and tip them in! Only it doesn't get there because the pilot takes a detour is this right? to pick up some lobster...? OK, so the guy is cool, but... I mean own up, this is barking time, this is major lunch, this is stool approaching critical mass, this is... this is... total vocabulary failure!" 
"Shut up!" his right head yelled at his left, "we're flanging!" 
He got a good calming grip on the remaining beer can. 
"Listen, guys," he resumed after a moment's peace and contemplation. The two officials had said nothing. Conversation at this level was not something to which they felt they could aspire. "I 
just want to know," insisted Zaphod, "what you're getting me into here." 
He stabbed a finger at the intermittent readings trickling over the computer screen. They meant nothing to him but he didn't like the look of them at all. They were all squiggly with lots of long numbers and things. 
"It's breaking up, is that it?" he shouted. "It's got a hold full of epsilonic radiating aorist rods or something that'll fry this whole space sector for zillions of years back and it's breaking up. Is that the story? Is that what we're going down to find? Am I going to come out of that wreck with even more heads?" 
"It cannot possibly be a wreck, Mr. Beeblebrox," insisted the official, "the ship is guaranteed to be perfectly safe. It cannot possibly break up." 
"Then why are you so keen to go and look at it?" 
"We like to look at things that are perfectly safe." 
"Freeeooow!" 
"Mr. Beeblebrox," said the official, patiently, "may I remind you that you have a job to do?" 
"Yeah, well, maybe I don't feel so keen on doing it all of a sudden. What do you think I am, completely without any moral whatsits, what are they called, those moral things?" 
"Scruples?" 
"Scruples, thank you, whatsoever? Well?" 
The two officials waited calmly. They coughed slightly to help pass the time. 
Zaphod sighed a "what is the world coming to" sort of sigh to absolve himself from all blame, and swung himself around in his seat. 
"Ship?" he called. "Yup?" said the ship. "Do what I do." 
The ship thought about this for a few milliseconds and then, after double checking all the seals on its heavy duty bulkheads, it began slowly, inexorably, in the hazy blaze of its lights, to sink to the lowest depths. 
Five hundred feet. A thousand.â¨Two thousand. 
Here, at a pressure of nearly seventy atmospheres, in the chilling depths where no light reaches, nature keeps its most heated imaginings. Two foo6: long nightmares loomed wildly into the bleaching light, yawned, and vanished back into the blackness. 
Two and a half thousand feet. 
At the dim edges of the ship's lights guilty secrets flitted by with their eyes on stalks. 
Gradually the topography of the distantly approaching ocean bed resolved with greater and greater clarity on the computer displays until as last a shape could be made out that was separate and distinct from its surroundings. It was like a huge lopsided cylindrical fortress that widened sharply halfway along its length to accommodate the heavy ultraplating with which the crucial storage holds were clad, and which were supposed by its builders to have made this the most secure and impregnable spaceship ever built. Before launch the material structure of this section had been battered, rammed, blasted and subjected to every assault its builders knew it could withstand in order to demonstrate that it could withstand them. 
The tense silence in the cockpit tightened perceptibly as it became dear that it was this section that had broken rather neatly in two. 
"In fact it's perfectly safe," said one of the officials, "it's built so that even if the ship does break up, the storage holds cannot possibly be breached." 
Three thousand, eight hundred and twenty-five feet. 
Four Hi-Presh-A Smart Suits moved slowly out of the open hatchway of the salvage craft and waded through the barrage of its lights toward the monstrous shape that loomed darkly out of the sea night. They moved with a sort of clumsy grace, near weightlessness though weighed on by a world of water. 
With his right-hand head Zaphod peered up into the black immensities above him and for a moment his mind sang with a silent 
roar of horror. He glanced to his left and was relieved to see that his other head was busy watching the Brockian Ultra-Cricket broadcasts on the helmet vid without concern. Slightly behind him to his left walked the two officials from the Safety and Civil Reassurance Administration, slightly in front of him to his right walked the empty suit, carrying their implements and testing the way for them. 
They passed the huge rift in the broken backed Starship Billion Year Bunker, and played their flashlights up into it. Mangled machinery loomed between torn and twisted bulkheads, two feet thick. A family of large transparent eels lived in there now and seemed to like it. 
The empty suit preceded them along the length of the ship's gigantic murky hull, trying the airlocks. The third one it tested ground open uneasily. They crowded inside it and waited for several long minutes while the pump mechanisms dealt with the hideous pressure that the ocean exerted, and slowly replaced it with an equally hideous pressure of air and inert gases. At last the inner door slid open and they were admitted to a dark outer holding area of the Starship Billion Year Bunker. 
Several more high security Titan-O-Hold doors had to be passed through, each of which the officials opened with a selection of quark keys. Soon they were so deep within the heavy security fields that the UltraCricket broadcasts were beginning to fade, and Zaphod had to switch to one of the rock video stations, since there was nowhere that they were not able to reach. 
A final doorway slid open, and they emerged into a large sepulchral space. Zaphod played his flashlight against the opposite wall and it fell full on a wild-eyed screaming face. 
Zaphod screamed a diminished fifth himself, dropped his light and sat heavily on the floor, or rather on a body which had been lying there undisturbed for around six months and which reacted to being sat on by exploding with great violence. Zaphod wondered what to do about all this, and after a brief but hectic internal debate decided that passing out would be the very thing. 
He came to a few minutes later and pretended not to know who he was, where he was or how he had got there, but was nor able to convince anybody. He then pretended that his memory suddenly retuned with a rush and that the shock caused him to pass out again, but he was helped unwillingly to his feet by the empty suit which he 
was beginning to take a serious dislike to and forced to come to terms with his surroundings: 
They were dimly and fitfully lit and unpleasant in a number of respects, the most obvious of which was the colorful arrangement of parts of the ship's late lamented Navigation Officer over the floor, walls and ceiling, and especially over the lower half of his, Zaphod's, suit. The effect of this was so astoundingly nasty that we shall not be referring to it again at any point in this narrative other than to record briefly the fact that it caused Zaphod to throw up inside his suit, which he therefore removed and swapped, after suitable headgear modifications, with the empty one. Unfortunately the stench of the fetid air in the ship, followed by the sight of his own suit walking around casually draped in rotting intestines was enough to make him throw up in the other suit as well, which was a problem that he and the suit would simply have to live with. 
There. All done. No more nastiness. 
At least, no more of that particular nastiness. 
The owner of the screaming face had calmed down very slightly now and was babbling away incoherently in a large tank of yellow liquid- 
emergency suspension tank. 
"It was crazy," he babbled, "crazy! I told him we could always try the lobster on the way back, but he was crazy. Obsessed! Do you ever get like that about lobster? Because I don't. Seems to me it's all rubbery and fiddly to eat, and not that much taste, well I mean is there? I infinitely prefer scallops, and said so. Oh Zarquon, I said so!" 
Zaphod stared at this extraordinary apparition, flailing in its tank. The man was attached to all kinds of life-support tubes, and his voice was bubbling out of speakers that echoed insanely around the ship, returning as haunting echoes from deep and distant corridors. 
"That was where I went wrong," the madman yelled, "I actually said that I preferred scallops and he said it was because I hadn't had real lobster like they did where his ancestors came from, which was here, and he'd prove it. He said it was no problem, he said the lobster here was worth a whole journey, let alone the small diversion it would take to get here, and he swore he could handle the ship in the atmosphere, but it was madness, madness!" he screamed, and paused with his eyes rolling, as if the word had rung some kind of bell 
in his mind. "The ship went right out of control! I couldn't believe what we were doing and just to prove a point about lobster which is really so overrated as a food, I'm sorry to go on about lobsters so much, I'll try and stop in a minute, but they've been on my mind so much for the months I've been in this tank, can you imagine what it's like to be stuck in a ship with the same guys for months eating junk food when all one guy will talk about is lobster and then spend six months floating by yourself in a tank thinking about it. I promise I will try and shut up about the lobsters, I really will. Lobsters, lobsters, lobsters enough! I think I'm the only survivor. I'm the only one who managed to get to an emergency tank before we went down. I sent out the Mayday and then we hit. It's a disaster, isn't it? A total disaster, and all because the guy liked lobsters. How much sense am I making? It's really hard for me to tell." 
He gazed at them beseechingly, and his mind seemed to sway slowly back down to earth like a falling leaf. He blinked and looked at them oddly like a monkey peering at a strange fish. He scrabbled curiously with his wrinkled up fingers at the glass side of the tank. Tiny, thick yellow bubbles loosed themselves from his mouth and nose, caught briefly in his swab of hair and strayed on upward. 
"Oh Zarquon, oh heavens," he mumbled pathetically to himself, "I've been found. I've been rescued...." 
"Well," said one of the officials, briskly,"you've been found at least." He strode over to the main computer bank in the middle of the chamber and started checking quickly through the ship's main monitor circuits for damage reports. 
"The aorist rod chambers are intact," he said. 
"Holy dingo's dos," snarled Zaphod, "there are aorist rods on board...!" 
Aorist rods were devices used in a now happily abandoned form of energy production. When the hunt for new sources of energy had at one point got particularly frantic, one bright young chap suddenly spotted that one place which had never used up all its available energy the past. And with the sudden rush of blood to the head that such insights tend to induce, he invented a way of mining it that very same night, and within a year huge tracts of the past were being drained of all their energy and simply wasting away Those who claimed that the past should be left unspoiled were accused of 
indulging in an extremely expensive form of sentimentality. The past provided a very cheap, plentiful and clean source of energy, there could always be a few Natural Past Reserves set up if anyone wanted to pay for their upkeep, and as for the claim that draining the past impoverished the present, well, maybe it did, slightly, but the effects were immeasurable and you really had to keep a sense of proportion. 
It was only when it was realized that the present really was being impoverished, and that the reason for it was that those selfish plundering wastrel bastards up in the future were doing exactly the same thing, that everyone realized that every single aorist rod, and the terrible secret of how they were made, would have to be utterly and forever destroyed. They claimed it was for the sake of their grandparents and grandchildren, but it was of course for the sake of their grandparent's grandchildren, and their grandchildren's grandparents. 
The official from the Safety and Civil Reassurance Administration gave a dismissive shrug. 
"They're perfectly safe," he said. He glanced up at Zaphod and suddenly said with uncharacteristic frankness,"There's worse than that on board. At least," he added, tapping at one of the computer screens, "I hope it's on board." 
The other official rounded on him sharply. 
"What the hell do you think you're saying?" he snapped. 
The first shrugged again. He said, "It doesn't matter. He can say what he likes. No one would believe him. It's why we chose to useâ¨him rather than do anything official, isn't it? The more wild the story he tells, the more it'll sound like he's some hippy adventurer making it up. He can even say that we said this and it'll make him sound like a paranoid." He smile' pleasantly at Zaphod who was seething in his nasty suit. "You may accompany us," he told him, "if you wish." 
"You see?" said the official, examining the ultra-titanium outer seals of the aorist rod hold. "Perfectly secure, perfectly safe." 
He said the same thing as they passed holds containing chemical weapons so powerful that a teaspoonful could fatally infect an entire planet. 
He said the same thing as they passed holds containing zeta-activq. compounds so powerful that a teaspoonful could blow up a whole planet. 
He said the same thing as they passed holds containing theta-active compounds so powerful that a teaspoonful could irradiate a whole planet. 
"I'm glad I'm not a planet," muttered Zaphod. 
"You'd have nothing to fear," assured the official from the Safety and Civil Reassurance Administration, "planets are very safe. Provided," he added and paused. They were approaching the hold nearest to the point where the back of the Starship Billion Year Bunker was broken. The corridor here was twisted and deformed, and the floor was damp and sticky in patches. 
"Ho hum," he said,"ho very much hum."â¨"What's in this hold?" demanded Zaphod. "By-products," said the official, clamming up again. "By-products...," insisted Zaphod, quietly, "of what?" 
Neither official answered. Instead, they examined the hold door very carefully and saw that its seals were twisted apart by the forces that had deformed the whole corridor. One of them touched the door lightly. It swung open to his touch. There was darkness inside, with just a couple of dim yellow lights deep within it. 
"Of what?" hissed Zaphod. 
The leading official turned to the other. 
"There's an escape capsule," he said, "that the crew were to use to abandon ship before jettisoning it into the black hole," he said. "I think it would be good to know that it's still there." The other official nodded and left without a word. 
The first official quietly beckoned Zaphod in. The large dim yellow lights glowed about twenty feet from them. 
"The reason," he said, quietly, "why everything else in this ship is, I maintain, safe, is that no one is really crazy enough to use them. No one. At least no one that crazy would ever get near them. Anyone that mad or dangerous rings very deep alarm bells. People may be stupid but they're not that stupid." 
"By-products," hissed Zaphod again, he had to hiss in order that his voice shouldn't be heard to tremble, "of what." 
"Er, Designer People." 
"What? " 
"The Sirius Cybernetics Corporation was awarded a huge research grant to design and produce synthetic personalities to order. The results were uniformly disastrous. All the 'people' and 'personalities' turned out to be amalgams of characteristics that simply could not co- exist in naturally occurring life forms. Most of them were just poor pathetic misfits, but some were deeply, deeply dangerous. Dangerous because they didn't ring alarm bells in other people. They could walk through situations the way that ghosts walk through walls, because no one spotted the danger. 
"The most dangerous of all were three identical ones they were put in this hold, to be blasted, with this ship, right out of this universe. They are not evil, in fact they are rather simple and charming. But they are the most dangerous creatures that ever lived because there is nothing they will not do if allowed, and nothing they will not be allowed to do...." 
Zaphod looked at the dim yellow lights, the two dim yellow lights. As his eyes became accustomed to the light he saw that the two lights framed a third space where something was broken. Wet sticky patches gleamed dully on the floor. 
Zaphod and the official walked cautiously toward the lights. At that moment, four words came crashing into the helmet headsets from the other official. 
"The capsule is gone," he said tersely. 
"Trace it," snapped Zaphod's companion. "Find exactly where it has gone. We must know where it has gone!" 
Zaphod slid aside a large ground-glass door. Beyond it lay a tank full of thick yellow liquid, and floating in it was a man, a kindly looking man with lots of pleasant laugh lines around his face. He seemed to be floating quite contentedly and smiling to himself. 
Another terse message suddenly came through his helmet headset. The planet toward which the escape capsule had headed had already been identified. It was in Galactic Sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha. 
The kindly looking man in the tank seemed to be babbling gently to himself, just as the co-pilot had been in his tank. Little yellow bubbles beaded on the man's lips. Zaphod found a small speaker by the tank 
and turned it on. He heard the man babbling gently about a shining city on a hill. 
He also heard the official from the Safety and Civil Reassurance Administration issue instructions that the planet in ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha must be made "perfectly safe."

MOSTLY HARMLESS 
For Ron 
With grateful thanks to Sue Freestone and Michael Bywater for their support, help and the constructive abuse. 
Anything that happens, happens. 
Anything that, in happening, causes something else to happen, causes something else to happen. 
Anything that, in happening, causes itself to happen again, happens again. 
It doesn't necessarily do it in chronological order, though. 
Chapter 1 
The history of the Galaxy has got a little muddled, for a number of reasons: partly because those who are trying to keep track of it have got a little muddled, but also because some very muddling things have been happening anyway. 
One of the problems has to do with the speed of light and the difficulties involved in trying to exceed it. You can't. Nothing travels faster than the speed of light with the possible exception of bad news, which obeys its own special laws. The Hingefreel people ofâ¨Arkintoofle Minor did try to build spaceships that were powered by bad news but they didn't work particularly well and were soâ¨extremely unwelcome whenever they arrived anywhere that there wasn't really any point in being there. 
So, by and large, the peoples of the Galaxy tended to languish in their own local muddles and the history of the Galaxy itself was, for a long time, largely cosmological. 
Which is not to say that people weren't trying. They tried sending off fleets of spaceships to do battle or business in distant parts, but these usually took thousands of years to get anywhere. By the time they eventually arrived, other forms of travel had been discovered which made use of hyperspace to circumvent the speed of light, so that whatever battles it was that the slower-than-light fleets had been sent to fight had already been taken care of centuries earlier by the time they actually got there. 
This didn't, of course, deter their crews from wanting to fight the battles anyway. They were trained, they were ready, they'd had a couple of thousand years sleep, they'd come a long way to do a tough job and by Zarquon they were going to do it. 
This was when the first major muddles of Galactic history set in, with battles continually re-erupting centuries after the issues they had been fought over had supposedly been settled. However, these muddles were as nothing to the ones which historians had to try and 
unravel once time-travel was discovered and battles started pre- erupting hundreds of years before the issues even arose. When the Infinite Improbability Drive arrived and whole planets started turning unexpectedly into banana fruitcake, the great history faculty of the University of MaxiMegalon finally gave up, closed itself down and surrendered its buildings to the rapidly growing joint faculty of Divinity and Water Polo, which had been after them for years. 
Which is all very well, of course, but it almost certainly means that no one will ever know for sure where, for instance, the Grebulons came from, or exactly what it was they wanted. And this is a pity, because if anybody had known anything about them, it is just possible that a most terrible catastrophe would have been averted or at least would have had to find a different way to happen. 
Click, hum. 
The huge grey Grebulon reconnaissance ship moved silently through the black void. It was travelling at fabulous, breath-taking speed, yet appeared, against the glimmering background of a billion distant stars to be moving not at all. It was just one dark speck frozen against an infinite granularity of brilliant night. 
On board the ship, everything was as it had been for millennia, deeply dark and silent. 
Click, hum.â¨At least, almost everything.â¨Click, click, hum.â¨Click, hum, click, hum, click, hum. Click, click, click, click, click, hum. Hmmm. 
A low level supervising program woke up a slightly higher level supervising program deep in the ship's semi-somnolent cyberbrain and reported to it that whenever it went click all it got was a hum. 
The higher level supervising program asked it what it was supposed to get, and the low level supervising program said that it couldn't remember exactly, but thought it was probably more of a sort of distant satisfied sigh, wasn't it? It didn't know what this hum was. Click, hum, click, hum. That was all it was getting. 
The higher level supervising program considered this and didn't like it. It asked the low level supervising program what exactly it was supervising and the low level supervising program said it couldn't remember that either, just that it was something that was meant to go click, sigh every ten years or so, which usually happened without fail. It had tried to consult its error look-up table but couldn't find it, which was why it had alerted the higher level supervising program to the problem. 
The higher level supervising program went to consult one of its own look-up tables to find out what the low level supervising program was meant to be supervising. 
It couldn't find the look-up table. 
Odd. 
It looked again. All it got was an error message. It tried to look up the error message in its error message look-up table and couldn't find that either. It allowed a couple of nanoseconds to go by while it went through all this again. Then it woke up its sector function supervisor. 
The sector function supervisor hit immediate problems. It called its supervising agent which hit problems too. Within a few millionths of a second virtual circuits that had lain dormant, some for years, some for centuries, were flaring into life throughout the ship. Something, somewhere, had gone terribly wrong, but none of the supervising programs could tell what it was. At every level, vital instructions were missing, and the instructions about what to do in the event of discovering that vital instructions were missing, were also missing. 
Small modules of software-agents-surged through the logical pathways, grouping, consulting, re-grouping. They quickly established that the ship's memory, all the way back to its central mission module, was in tatters. No amount of interrogation could determine what it was that had happened. Even the central mission module itself seemed to be damaged. 
This made the whole problem very simple to deal with. Replace the central mission module. There was another one, a backup, an exact duplicate of the original. It had to be physically replaced because, for safety reasons, there was no link whatsoever between the original and its backup. Once the central mission module was replaced it could itself supervise the reconstruction of the rest of the system in every detail, and all would be well. 
Robots were instructed to bring the backup central mission module from the shielded strong room, where they guarded it, to the ship's logic chamber for installation. 
This involved the lengthy exchange of emergency codes and protocols as the robots interrogated the agents as to the authenticity of the instructions. At last the robots were satisfied that all procedures were correct. They unpacked the backup central mission module from its storage housing, carried it out of the storage chamber, fell out of the ship and went spinning off into the void. 
This provided the first major clue as to what it was that was wrong. 
Further investigation quickly established what it was that had happened. A meteorite had knocked a large hole in the ship. The ship had not previously detected this because the meteorite had neatly knocked out that part of the ship's processing equipment which was supposed to detect if the ship had been hit by a meteorite. The first thing to do was to try to seal up the hole. This turned out to be impossible, because the ship's sensors couldn't see that there was a hole, and the supervisors which should have said that the sensors weren't working properly weren't working properly and kept saying that the sensors were fine. The ship could only deduce the existence of the hole from the fact that the robots had clearly fallen out of it, taking its spare brain, which would have enabled it to see the hole, with them. 
The ship tried to think intelligently about this, failed, and then blanked out completely for a bit. It didn't realise it had blanked out, of course, because it had blanked out. It was merely surprised to see the stars jump. After the third time the stars jumped the ship finally realised that it must be blanking out, and that it was time to take some serious decisions. 
It relaxed. 
Then it realised it hadn't actually taken the serious decisions yet and panicked. It blanked out again for a bit. When it awoke again it sealed all the bulkheads around where it knew the unseen hole must be. 
It clearly hadn't got to its destination yet, it thought, fitfully, but since it no longer had the faintest idea where its destination was or how to reach it, there seemed to be little point in continuing. It 
consulted what tiny scraps of instructions it could reconstruct from the tatters of its central mission module. 
"Your!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! year mission is to!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, land!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! a safe distance!!!!!!!!!!..................., land............... 
monitor it.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!..." 
All of the rest was complete garbage. 
Before it blanked out for good the ship would have to pass on those instructions, such as they were, to its more primitive subsidiary systems. 
It must also revive all of its crew. 
There was another problem. While the crew was in hibernation, the minds of all of its members, their memories, their identities and their understanding of what they had come to do, had all been transferred into the ship's central mission module for safe keeping. The crew would not have the faintest idea of who they were or what they were doing there. Oh well. 
Just before it blanked out for the final time, the ship realised that its engines were beginning to give out too. 
The ship and its revived and confused crew coasted on under the control of its subsidiary automatic systems, which simply looked to land wherever they could find to land and monitor whatever they could find to monitor. 
As far as finding something to land on was concerned, they didn't do very well. The planet they found was desolately cold and lonely, so achingly far from the sun that should warm it, that it took all of the Envir-O-Form machinery and LifeSupport-O-Systems they carried with them to render it, or at least enough parts of it, habitable. There were better planets nearer in, but the ship's Strateej-O-Mat was obviously locked into Lurk mode and chose the most distant and unobtrusive planet and, further-more, would not be gainsaid by anybody other than the ship's Chief Strategic Officer. Since everybody on the ship had lost their minds no one knew who the Chief Strategic Officer was or, even if he could have been identified, how he was supposed to go about gainsaying the ship's Strateej-O-Mat. 
As far as finding something to monitor was concerned, though, they hit solid gold. 
Chapter 2 
One of the extraordinary things about life is the sort of places it's prepared to put up with living. Anywhere it can get some kind of a grip, whether it's the intoxicating seas of Santraginus V, where the fish never seem to care whatever the heck kind of direction they swim in, the fire storms of Frastra where, they say, life begins at 40,000 degrees, or just burrowing around in the lower intestine of a rat for the sheer unadulterated hell of it, life will always find a way of hanging on in somewhere. 
It will even live in New York, though it's hard to know why. In the winter time the temperature falls well below the legal minimum, or rather it would do if anybody had the common sense to set a legal minimum. The last time anybody made a list of the top hundred character attributes of New Yorkers, common sense snuck in at number 79. 
In the summer it's too darn hot. It's one thing to be the sort of life form that thrives on heat and finds, as the Frastrans do, that the temperature range between 40,000 and 40,004 is very equable, but it's quite another to be the sort of animal that has to wrap itself up in lots of other animals at one point in your planet's orbit, and then find, half an orbit later, that your skin's bubbling. 
Spring is over-rated. A lot of the inhabitants of New York will honk on mightily about the pleasures of spring, but if they actually knew the first thing about the pleasures of spring they would know of at least five thousand nine hundred and eighty-three better places to spend it than New York, and that's just on the same latitude. 
Fall, though, is the worst. Few things are worse than fall in New York. Some of the things that live in the lower intestines of rats would disagree, but most of the things that live in the lower intestines of rats are highly disagreeable anyway, so their opinion can and should be discounted. When it's fall in New York, the air smells as if someone's been frying goats in it, and if you are keen to breathe, the best plan is to open a window and stick your head in a building. 
Tricia McMillan loved New York. She kept on telling herself thisâ¨over and over again. The Upper West Side. Yeah. Mid Town. Hey,â¨great retail. SoHo. The East Village. Clothes. Books. Sushi. Italian. Delis. Yo. 
Movies. Yo also. Tricia had just been to see Woody Allen's new movie which was all about the angst of being neurotic in New York. He had made one or two other movies that had explored the same theme, and Tricia wondered if he had ever considered moving, but heard that he had set his face against the idea. So: more movies, she guessed. 
Tricia loved New York because loving New York was a good career move. It was a good retail move, a good cuisine move, not a good taxi move or a great quality of pavement move, but definitely a career move that ranked amongst the highest and the best. Tricia was a TV anchor person, and New York was where most of the world's TV was anchored. Tricia's TV anchoring had been done exclusively in Britain up to that point: regional news, then breakfast news, early evening news. She would have been called, if the language allowed, a rapidly rising anchor, but... hey, this is television, what does it matter? She was a rapidly rising anchor. She had what it took: great hair, a profound understanding of strategic lip gloss, the intelligence to understand the world and a tiny secret interior deadness which meant she didn't care. Everybody has their moment of great opportunity in life. If you happen to miss the one you care about, then everything else in life becomes eerily easy. 
Tricia had only ever missed one opportunity. These days it didn't even make her tremble quite so much as it used to think about it. She guessed it was that bit of her that had gone dead. 
NBS needed a new anchor. Mo Minetti was leaving the US/AM breakfast show to have a baby. She had been offered a mind-bubbling amount of money to have it on the show, but she had declined, unexpectedly, on grounds of personal privacy and taste. Teams of NBS lawyers had sieved through her contract to see if these constituted legitimate grounds, but in the end, reluctantly, they had to let her go. This was, for them, particularly galling because normally "reluctantly letting someone go" was an expression that had its boot on quite another foot. 
The word was out that maybe, just maybe, a British accent would fit. The hair, the skin tone and the bridgework would have to be up to American network standards, but there had been a lot of British accents up there thanking their mothers for their Oscars, a lot of British accents singing on Broadway, and some unusually big audiences tuning in to British accents in wigs on Masterpiece Theatre. British accents were telling jokes on David Letterman and Jay Leno. Nobody understood the jokes but they were really responding to the accents, so maybe it was time, just maybe. A British accent on US/AM. Well, hell. 
That was why Tricia was here. This was why loving New York was a great career move. 
It wasn't, of course, the stated reason. Her TV company back in the UK would hardly have stumped up the air fare and hotel bill for her to go job hunting in Manhattan. Since she was chasing something likeâ¨ten times her present salary, they might have felt that she could have forked out her own expenses, but she'd found a story, found a pretext, kept very quiet about anything ulterior, and they'd stumped up forâ¨the trip. A business class ticket, of course, but her face was knownâ¨and she'd smiled herself an upgrade. The right moves had got her a nice room at the Brentwood and here she was, wondering what to do next. 
The word on the street was one thing, making contact was another. She had a couple of names, a couple of numbers, but all it took was being put on indeterminate hold a couple of times and she was back at square one. She'd put out feelers, left messages, but so far none had been returned. The actual job she had come to do she had done in a morning; the imagined job she was after was only shimmering tantalisingly on an unreachable horizon. 
Shit. 
She caught a cab from the movie theatre back to the Brentwood. The cab couldn't get close to the kerb because a big stretch limo was hogging all the available space and she had to squeeze her way past it. She walked out of the fetid, goat-frying air and into the blessed coolâ¨of the lobby. The fine cotton of her blouse was sticking like grime to her skin. Her hair felt as if she'd bought it at a fairground on a stick. At the front desk she asked if there were any messages, grimly expecting none. There was one. 
Oh... 
Good. 
It had worked. She had gone out to the movie specifically in order to make the phone ring. She couldn't bear sitting in a hotel room waiting. 
She wondered. Should she open the message down here? Her clothes were itching and she longed to take them all off and just lie on the bed. She had turned the air conditioning way down to its bottom temperature setting, way up to its top fan setting. What she wanted more than anything else in the world at the moment was goose pimples. Then a hot shower, then a cool one, then lying on a towel, on the bed again, drying in the air conditioning. Then reading the message. Maybe more goose pimples. Maybe all sorts of things. 
No. What she wanted more than anything else in the world was a job in American television at ten times her current salary. More than anything else in the world. In the world. What she wanted more than anything else at all was no longer a live issue. 
She sat on a chair in the lobby, under a kentia palm, and opened the little cellophane-windowed envelope. 
"Please call," it said. "Not happy," and gave a number. The name was Gail Andrews. 
Gail Andrews. 
It wasn't a name she was expecting. It caught her unawares. She recognised it, but couldn't immediately say why. Was she Andy Martin's secretary? Hilary Bass's assistant? Martin and Bass were the two major contact calls she had made, or tried to make, at NBS. And what did "Not happy" mean? 
"Not happy?" 
She was completely bewildered. Was this Woody Allen trying to contact her under an assumed name? It was a 212 area code number. So it was someone in New York. Who was not happy. Well, that narrowed it down a bit, didn't it? 
She went back to the receptionist at the desk. 
"I have a problem with this message you just gave me," she said. "Someone I don't know has tried to call me and says she's not happy." 
The receptionist peered at the note with a frown. "Do you know this person?" he said. 
"No," Tricia said. 
"Hmmm," said the receptionist. "Sounds like she's not happy about something." 
"Yes," said Tricia. 
"Looks like there's a name here," said the receptionist. "Gail Andrews. Do you know anybody of that name?" 
"No," said Tricia.â¨"Any idea what she's unhappy about?"â¨"No," said Tricia.â¨"Have you called the number? There's a number here." 
"No," said Tricia, "you only just gave me the note. I'm just trying to get some more information before I ring back. Perhaps I could talk to the person who took the call?" 
"Hmmm," said the receptionist, scrutinising the note carefully. "I don't think we have anybody called Gail Andrews here." 
"No, I realise that," said Tricia. "I just " 
"I'm Gail Andrews." 
The voice came from behind Tricia. She turned round. 
"I'm sorry?" 
"I'm Gail Andrews. You interviewed me this morning." 
"Oh. Oh good heavens yes," said Tricia, slightly flustered. 
"I left the message for you a few hours ago. I hadn't heard so I came by. I didn't want to miss you." 
"Oh. No. Of course," said Tricia, trying hard to get up to speed. 
"I don't know about this," said the receptionist, for whom speed was not an issue. "Would you like me to try this number for you now?" 
"No, that'll be fine, thanks," said Tricia. "I can handle it now." 
"I can call this room number here for you if that'll help," said the receptionist, peering at the note again. 
"No, that won't be necessary, thanks," said Tricia. "That's my own room number. I'm the one the message was for. I think we've sorted this out now." 
"You have a nice day now," said the receptionist.â¨Tricia didn't particularly want to have a nice day. She was busy. 
She also didn't want to talk to Gail Andrews. She had a very strict cut-off point as far as fraternising with the Christians was concerned. Her colleagues called her interview subjects Christians and would often cross themselves when they saw one walking innocently into the studio to face Tricia, particularly if Tricia was smiling warmly and showing her teeth. 
She turned and smiled frostily, wondering what to do. 
Gail Andrews was a well-groomed woman in her mid-forties. Her clothes fell within the boundaries defined by expensive good taste,â¨but were definitely huddled up at the floatier end of those boundaries. She was an astrologer a famous and, if rumour were true, influential astrologer, having allegedly influenced a number of decisions madeâ¨by the late President Hudson, including everything from which flavour of cream whip to have on which day of the week, to whether or not to bomb Damascus. 
Tricia had savaged her more than somewhat. Not on the grounds of whether or not the stories about the President were true, that was old hat now. At the time Ms. Andrews had emphatically denied advising President Hudson on anything other than personal, spiritual or dietary matters, which did not, apparently include the bombing of Damascus. ("NOTHING PERSONAL, DAMASCUS!" the tabloids had hooted at the time.) 
No, this was a neat topical little angle that Tricia had come up with about the whole issue of astrology itself. Ms. Andrews had not been entirely ready for it. Tricia, on the other hand, was not entirely ready for a re-match in the hotel lobby. What to do? 
"I can wait for you in the bar, if you need a few minutes," said Gail Andrews. "But I would like to talk to you, and I'm leaving the city tonight." 
She seemed to be slightly anxious about something rather than aggrieved or irate. 
"OK," said Tricia. "Give me ten minutes." 
She went up to her room. Apart from anything else, she had so little faith in the ability of the guy on the message desk at reception to deal with anything as complicated as a message that she wanted to be doubly certain that there wasn't a note under the door. It wouldn't be the first time that messages at the desk and messages under the door had been completely at odds with each other. 
There wasn't one. 
The message light on the phone was flashing though. 
She hit the message button and got the hotel operator. 
"You have a message from Gary Andress," said the operator. 
"Yes?" said Tricia. An unfamiliar name. "What does it say." 
"Not hippy," said the operator. 
"Not what?" said Tricia. 
"Hippy. What it says. Guy says he's not a hippy. I guess he wanted you to know that. You want the number?" 
As she started to dictate the number Tricia suddenly realised that this was just a garbled version of the message she had already had. 
"OK, OK," she said. "Are there any other messages for me?" 
"Room number?" 
Tricia couldn't work out why the operator should suddenly ask for her number this late in the conversation, but gave it to her anyway. 
"Name?"â¨"McMillan, Tricia McMillan." Tricia spelt it, patiently. "Not Mr. MacManus?"â¨"No."â¨"No more messages for you." Click. 
Tricia sighed and dialled again. This time she gave her name and room number all over again, up front. The operator showed not the slightest glimmer of recognition that they had been speaking less than ten seconds ago. 
"I'm going to be in the bar," Tricia explained. "In the bar. If a phone call comes through for me, please would you put it through to me in the bar?" 
"Name?" 
They went through it all a couple more times till Tricia was certain that everything that possibly could be clear was as clear as it possibly could be. 
She showered, put on fresh clothes and retouched her makeup with the speed of a professional, and, looking at her bed with a sigh, left the room again. 
She had half a mind just to sneak off and hide. 
No. Not really. 
She had a look at herself in the mirror in the elevator lobby while she was waiting. She looked cool and in charge, and if she could fool herself she could fool anybody. 
She was just going to have to tough it out with Gail Andrews. OK, she had given her a hard time. Sorry but that's the game we're all in that sort of thing. Ms. Andrews had agreed to do the interview because she had a new book out and TV exposure was free publicity. But there's no such thing as a free launch. No, she edited that line out again. 
What had happened was this: 
Last week astronomers had announced that they had at last discovered a tenth planet, out beyond the orbit of Pluto. They had been searching for it for years, Guided by certain orbital anomalies in the outer planets, and now they'd found it and they were all terribly pleased, and everyone was terribly happy for them and so on. The planet was named Persephone, but rapidly nicknamed Rupert after some astronomer's parrot there was some tediously heart-warming story attached to this and that was all very wonderful and lovely. 
Tricia had followed the story with, for various reasons, considerable interest. 
Then, while she had been casting around for a good excuse to go to New York at her TV company's expense she had happened to notice a press release about Gail Andrews, and her new book, You and Your Planets. 
Gail Andrews was not exactly a household name, but the moment you mentioned President Hudson, cream whips and the amputation of Damascus (the world had moved on from surgical strikes. The official term had in fact been "Damascectomy", meaning the "taking out" of Damascus), everyone remembered who you meant. 
Tricia saw an angle here which she quickly sold to her producer. 
Surely the notion that great lumps of rock whirling in space knew something about your day that you didn't must take a bit of a knock from the fact that there was suddenly a new lump of rock out there that nobody had known about before. 
That must throw a few calculations out, mustn't it? 
What about all those star charts and planetary motions and so? We all knew (apparently) what happened when Neptune was in Virgo, and so on, but what about when Rupert was rising? Wouldn't the whole of astrology have to be rethought? Wouldn't now perhaps be a good time to own up that it was all just a load of hogwash and instead take up pig-farming, the principles of which were founded on some kind of rational basis? If we'd known about Rupert three years ago, might President Hudson have been eating the boysenberry flavour on Thursday rather than Friday? Might Damascus still be standing? That sort of thing. 
Gail Andrews had taken it all reasonably well. She was just starting to recover from the initial onslaught, when she made the rather serious mistake of trying to shake Tricia off by talking smoothly about diurnal arcs, right ascensions and some of the more abstruse areas of three-dimensional trigonometry. 
To her shock she discovered that everything she delivered to Tricia came right back at her with more spin on it than she could cope with. Nobody had warned Gail that being a TV bimbo was, for Tricia, her second stab at a role in life. Behind her Chanel lip gloss, her coupe sauvage and her crystal blue contact lenses lay a brain that had acquired for itself, in an earlier, abandoned phase of her life, a first class degree in mathematics and a doctorate in astrophysics. 
As she was getting into the elevator Tricia, slightly preoccupied, realised she had left her bag in her room and wondered whether to duck back out and get it. No. It was probably safer where it was and there wasn't anything she particularly needed in it. She let the door close behind her. 
Besides, she told herself, taking a deep breath, if life had taught her anything it was this: Never go back for your bag. 
As the elevator went down she stared up at the ceiling in a rather intent way. Anyone who didn't know Tricia McMillan better would have said that that was exactly the way people sometimes stared upwards when they were trying to hold back tears. She must have been staring at the tiny security video camera mounted up in the corner. She marched rather briskly out of the elevator a minute later, and went up to the reception desk again. 
"Now, I'm going to write this out," she said, "because I don't want anything to go wrong." 
She wrote her name in large letters on a piece of paper, then her room number, then "IN THE BAR" and gave it to the receptionist, who looked at it. 
"That's in case there's a message for me. OK?"â¨The receptionist continued to look at it.â¨"You want me to see if she's in her room?" he said. 
Two minutes later, Tricia swivelled into the bar seat next to Gail Andrews, who was sitting in front of a glass of white wine. 
"You struck me as the sort of person who preferred to sit up at the bar rather than demurely at a table," she said. 
This was true, and caught Tricia a little by surprise. 
"Vodka?" said Gail. 
"Yes," said Tricia, suspiciously. She just stopped herself asking, "How did you know?" but Gail answered anyway. 
"I asked the barman," she said, with a kindly smile. 
The barman had her vodka ready for her and slid it charmingly across the glossy mahogany. 
"Thank you," said Tricia, stirring it sharply. 
She didn't know quite what to make out of all this sudden niceness and was determined not to be wrong-footed by it. People in New York were not nice to each other without reason. 
"Ms. Andrews," she said, firmly, "I'm sorry that you're not happy. I know you probably feel I was a bit rough with you this morning, but astrology is, after all, just popular entertainment, which is fine. It's part of showbiz and it's a part that you have done well out of and good luck to you. It's fun. It's not a science though, and it shouldn't be mistaken for one. I think that's something we both managed to demonstrate very successfully together this morning, while at the same time generating some popular entertainment, which is what we both do for a living. I'm sorry if you have a problem with that." 
"I'm perfectly happy," said Gail Andrews. 
"Oh," said Tricia, not quite certain what to make of this. "It said in your message that you were not happy." 
"No," said Gail Andrews. "I said in my message that I thought you were not happy, and I was just wondering why." 
Tricia felt as if she had been kicked in the back of the head. She blinked. 
"What?" she said quietly. 
"To do with the stars. You seemed very angry and unhappy about something to do with stars and planets when we were having our discussion, and it's been bothering me, which is why I came to see if you were all right." 
Tricia stared at her. "Ms. Andrews " she started, and then realised that the way she had said it sounded exactly angry and unhappy and rather undermined the protest she had been trying to make. 
"Please call me Gail, if that's OK." 
Tricia just looked bewildered. 
"I know that astrology isn't a science," said Gail. "Of course it isn't. It's just an arbitrary set of rules like chess or tennis or, what's that strange thing you British play?" 
"Er, cricket? Self-loathing?" 
"Parliamentary democracy. The rules just kind of got there. They don't make any kind of sense except in terms of themselves. But when you start to exercise those rules, all sorts of processes start to happen and you start to find out all sorts of stuff about people. In astrology the rules happen to be about stars and planets, but they could be about ducks and drakes for all the difference it would make. It's just a way of thinking about a problem which lets the shape of that problem begin to emerge. The more rules, the tinier the rules, the more arbitrary they are, the better. It's like throwing a handful of fine graphite dust on a piece of paper to see where the hidden indentations are. It lets you see the words that were written on the piece of paper above it that's now been taken away and hidden. The graphite's not important. It's just the means of revealing their indentations. So you see, astrology's nothing to do with astronomy. It's just to do with people thinking about people. 
"So when you got so, I don't know, so emotionally focused on stars and planets this morning, I began to think, she's not angry about astrology, she really is angry and unhappy about actual stars and 
planets. People usually only get that unhappy and angry when they've lost something. That's all I could think and I couldn't make any more sense of it than that. So I came to see if you were OK." 
Tricia was stunned. 
One part of her brain had already got started on all sorts of stuff. It was busy constructing all sorts of rebuttals to do with how ridiculous newspaper horoscopes were and the sort of statistical tricks they played on people. But gradually it petered out, because it realised that the rest of her brain wasn't listening. She had been completely stunned. 
She had just been told, by a total stranger, something she'd kept completely secret for seventeen years. 
She turned to look at Gail. "I..."â¨She stopped. 
A tiny security camera up behind the bar had turned to follow her movement. This completely flummoxed her. Most people would not have noticed it. It was not designed to be noticed. It was not designed to suggest that nowadays even an expensive and elegant hotel in New York couldn't be sure that its clientele wasn't suddenly going to pull a gun or not wear a tie. But carefully hidden though it was behind the vodka, it couldn't deceive the finely honed instinct of a TV anchor person, which was to know exactly when a camera was turning to look at her. 
"Is something wrong?" asked Gail. 
"No, I... I have to say that you've rather astonished me," said Tricia. She decided to ignore the security camera. It was just her imagination playing tricks with her because she had television so much on her mind today. It wasn't the first time it had happened. A traffic monitoring camera, she was convinced, had swung round to follow her as she walked past it, and a security camera in Bloomingdales had seemed to make a particular point of watching her trying on hats. She was obviously going dotty. She had even imagined that a bird in Central Park had been peering at her rather intently. 
She decided to put it out of her mind and took a sip of her vodka. Someone was walking round the bar asking people if they were Mr. MacManus. 
"OK," she said, suddenly blurting it out. "I don't know how you worked it out, but..." 
"I didn't work it out, as you put it. I just listened to what you were saying." 
"What I lost, I think, was a whole other life." 
"Everybody does that. Every moment of every day. Every single decision we make, every breath we draw, opens some doors and closes many others. Most of them we don't notice. Some we do. Sounds like you noticed one." 
"Oh yes, I noticed," said Tricia. "All right. Here it is. It's very simple. Many years ago I met a guy at a party. He said he was from another planet and did I want to go along with him. I said, yes, OK. It was that kind of party. I said to him to wait while I went to get my bag and then I'd be happy to go off to another planet with him. He said I wouldn't need my bag. I said he obviously came from a very backward planet or he'd know that a woman always needed to take her bag with her. He got a bit impatient, but I wasn't gong to be a complete pushover just because he said he was from another planet. 
"I went upstairs. Took me a while to find my bag, and then there was someone else in the bathroom. Came down and he was gone." 
Tricia paused. 
"And...?" said Gail. 
"The garden door was open. I went outside. There were lights. Some kind of gleaming thing. I was just in time to see it rise up into the sky, shoot silently up through the clouds and disappear. That was it. End of story. End of one life, beginning of another. But hardly a moment of this life goes by that I don't wonder about some other me. A me that didn't go back for her bag. I feel like she's out there somewhere and I'm walking in her shadow." 
A member of the hotel staff was now going round the bar asking people if they were Mr. Miller. Nobody was. 
"You really think this... person was from another planet?" asked Gail. 
"Oh, certainly. There was the spacecraft. Oh, and also he had two heads." 
"Two? Didn't anybody else notice?" "It was a fancy dress party." 
"I see..." 
"And he had a bird cage over it, of course. With a cloth over the cage. Pretended he had a parrot. He tapped on the cage and it did a lot of stupid "'Pretty Polly'" stuff and squawking and so on. Then he pulled the cloth back for a moment and roared with laughter. There was another head in there, laughing along with him. It was a worrying moment I can tell you." 
"I think you probably did the right thing, dear, don't you?" said Gail. 
"No," said Tricia. "No I don't. And I couldn't carry on doing what I was doing either. I was an astrophysicist, you see. You can't be an astrophysicist properly if you've actually met someone from another planet who's got a second head that pretends to be a parrot. You just can't do it. I couldn't at least." 
"I can see it would be hard. And that's probably why you tend to be a little hard on other people who talk what sounds like complete nonsense." 
"Yes," said Tricia. "I expect you're right. I'm sorry." "That's OK."â¨"You're the first person I've ever told this, by the way." "I wondered. You married?" 
"Er, no. So hard to tell these days isn't it? But you're right to ask because that was probably the reason. I came very close a few times, mostly because I wanted to have a kid. But every guy ended up asking why I was constantly looking over his shoulder. What do you tell someone? At one point I even thought I might just go to a sperm bank and take pot luck. Have somebody's child at random." 
"You can't seriously do that, can you?" 
Tricia laughed. "Probably not. I never quite went and found out for real. Never quite did it. Story of my life. Never quite did the real thing. That's why I'm in television I guess. Nothing is real." 
"Excuse me lady, your name Tricia McMillan?" 
Tricia looked round in surprise. There was a man standing there in a chauffeur's hat. 
"Yes," she said, instantly pulling herself back together again. 
"Lady, I been looking for you for about an hour. Hotel said they didn't have anybody of that name, but I checked back with Mr. 
Martin's office and they said that this was definitely where you staying. So I ask again, they still say they never heard of you, so I get them to page you anyway and they can't find you. In the end I get the office to FAX a picture of you through to the car and have a look myself." 
He looked at his watch. 
"May be a bit late now, but do you want to go anyway?" 
Tricia was stunned. 
"Mr. Martin? You mean Andy Martin at NBS?" 
"That's correct, lady. Screen test for US/AM." 
Tricia shot up out of her seat. She couldn't even bear to think of all the messages she'd heard for Mr. MacManus and Mr. Miller. 
"Only we have to hurry," said the chauffeur. "As I heard it Mr. Martin thinks it might be worth trying a British accent. His boss at the network is dead against the idea. That's Mr. Zwingler, and I happen to know he's flying out to the coast this evening because I'm the one has to pick him up and take him to the airport." 
"OK," said Tricia, "I'm ready. Let's go." 
"OK, lady. It's the big limo out the front." 
Tricia turned back to Gail. "I'm sorry," she said. 
"Go! Go!" said Gail. "And good luck. I've enjoyed meeting you." 
Tricia made to reach for her bag for some cash. 
"Damn," she said. She'd left it upstairs. 
"Drinks are on me," insisted Gail. "Really. It's been very interesting." 
Tricia sighed. 
"Look, I'm really sorry about this morning and..." 
"Don't say another word. I'm fine. It's only astrology. It's harmless. It's not the end of the world." 
"Thanks." On an impulse Tricia gave her a hug. 
"You got everything?" said the chauffeur. "You don't want to pick up your bag or anything?" 
"If there's one thing that life's taught me," said Tricia, "it's never go back for your bag." 
*** 
Just a little over an hour later, Tricia sat on one of the pair of beds in her hotel room. For a few minutes she didn't move. She just stared at her bag, which was sitting innocently on top of the other bed. 
In her hand was a note from Gail Andrews, saying, "Don't be too disappointed. Do ring if you want to talk about it. If I were you I'd stay in at home tomorrow night. Get some rest. But don't mind me, and don't worry. It's only astrology. It's not the end of the world. Gail." 
The chauffeur had been dead right. In fact the chauffeur seemed to know more about what was going on inside NBS than any other single person she had encountered in the organisation. Martin had been keen, Zwingler had not. She had had her one shot at proving Martin right and she had blown it. 
Oh well. Oh well, oh well, oh well. 
Time to go home. Time to phone the airline and see if she could still get the red-eye back to Heathrow. tonight. She reached for the big phone directory. 
Oh. First things first. 
She put down the directory again, picked up her handbag, and took it through to the bathroom. She put it down and took out the small plastic case which held her contact lenses, without which she had been unable properly to read either the script or the autocue. 
As she dabbed each tiny plastic cup into her eyes she reflected that if there was one thing life had taught her it was that there are times when you do not go back for your bag and other times when you do. It had yet to teach her to distinguish between the two types of occasion. 
Chapter 3 
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has, in what we laughingly call the past, had a great deal to say on the subject of parallel universes. Very little of this is, however, at all comprehensible to anyone below the level of Advanced God, and since it is now well-established that all known gods came into existence a good three millionths of a second after the Universe began rather than, as they usually claimed, the previous week, they already have a great deal of explaining to do as it is, and are therefore not available for comment on matters of deep physics at this time. 
One encouraging thing the Guide does have to say on the subject of parallel universes is that you don't stand the remotest chance of understanding it. You can therefore say "What?" and "Eh?" and even go cross-eyed and start to blither if you like without any fear of making a fool of yourself. 
The first thing to realise about parallel universes, the Guide says, is that they are not parallel. 
It is also important to realise that they are not, strictly speaking, universes either, but it is easiest if you try and realise that a little later, after you've realised that everything you've realised up to that moment is not true. 
The reason they are not universes is that any given universe is not actually a thing as such, but is just a way of looking at what is technically known as the WSOGMM, or Whole Sort of General Mish Mash. The Whole Sort of General Mish Mash doesn't actually exist either, but is just the sum total of all the different ways there would be of looking at it if it did. 
The reason they are not parallel is the same reason that the sea is not parallel. It doesn't mean anything. You can slice the Whole Sort of General Mish Mash any way you like and you will generally come up with something that someone will call home. 
Please feel free to blither now. 
*** 
The Earth with which we are here concerned, because of its particular orientation in the Whole Sort of General Mish Mash, was hit by a neutrino that other Earths were not. 
A neutrino is not a big thing to be hit by. 
In fact it's hard to think of anything much smaller by which one could reasonably hope to be hit. And it's not as if being hit by neutrinos was in itself a particularly unusual event for something the size of the Earth. Far from it. It would be an unusual nanosecond in which the Earth was not hit by several billion passing neutrinos. 
It all depends on what you mean by "hit", of course, seeing as matter consists almost entirely of nothing at all. The chances of a neutrino actually hitting something as it travels through all this howling emptiness are roughly comparable to that of dropping a ball bearing at random from a cruising 747 and hitting, say, an egg sandwich. 
Anyway, this neutrino hit something. Nothing terribly important in the scale of things, you might say. But the problem with saying something like that is that you would be talking cross-eyed badger spit. Once something actually happens somewhere in something as wildly complicated as the Universe, Kevin knows where it will all end up where "Kevin" is any random entity that doesn't know nothin' about nothin'. 
This neutrino struck an atom. 
The atom was part of a molecule. The molecule was part of a nucleic acid. The nucleic acid was part of a gene. The gene was part of a genetic recipe for growing... and so on. The upshot was that a plant ended up growing an extra leaf. In Essex. Or what would, after a lot of palaver and local difficulties of a geological nature, become Essex. 
The plant was a clover. It threw its weight, or rather its seed, around extremely effectively and rapidly became the world's dominant type of clover. The precise causal connection between this tiny biological happenstance, and a few other minor variations that exist in that slice of the Whole Sort of General Mish Mash such as Tricia McMillan failing to leave with Zaphod Beeblebrox, abnormally low sales of pecan-flavoured ice-cream and the fact that the Earth on which all this occurred did not get demolished by the Vogons to make way for a new hyperspace bypass is currently sitting at number 
4,763,984,132 on the research project priority list at what was once the History Department of the University of MaxiMegalon, and no one currently at the prayer meeting by the poolside appears to feel any sense of urgency about the problem. 
Chapter 4 
Tricia began to feel that the world was conspiring against her. She knew that this was a perfectly normal way to feel after an overnight flight going east, when you suddenly have a whole other mysteriously threatening day to deal with for which you are not the least bit prepared. But still. 
There were marks on her lawn. 
She didn't really care about marks on her lawn very much. Marks on her lawn could go and take a running jump as far as she was concerned. It was Saturday morning. She had just got home from New York feeling tired, crabby and paranoid, and all she wanted to do was go to bed with the radio on quietly and gradually fall asleep to the sound of Ned Sherrin being terribly clever about something. 
But Eric Bartlett was not going to let her get away with not making a thorough inspection of the marks. Eric was the old gardener who came in from the village on Saturday mornings to poke around at her garden with a stick. He didn't believe in people coming in from New York first thing in the morning. Didn't hold with it. Went against nature. He believed in virtually everything else, though. 
"Probably them space aliens," he said, bending over and prod-ding at the edges of the small indentations with his stick. "Hear a lot about space aliens these days. I expect it's them." 
"Do you?" said Tricia, looking furtively at her watch. Ten minutes, she reckoned. Ten minutes she'd be able to stay standing up. Then she would simply keel over, whether she was in her bedroom or still out here in the garden. That was if she just had to stand. If she also had to nod intelligently and say "Do you?" from time to time, it might cut it down to five. 
"Oh yes," said Eric. "They come down here, land on your lawn, and then buzz off again, sometimes with your cat. Mrs. Williams at the Post Office, her cat you know the ginger one? it got abducted by space aliens. Course, they brought it back the next day but it were in a 
very odd mood. Kept prowling around all morning, and then falling asleep in the afternoon. Used to be the other way round, is the point. Sleep in the morning, prowl in the afternoon. Jet lag, you see, from being in an interplanetary craft." 
"I see," said Tricia. 
"They dyed it tabby, too, she says. These marks are exactly the sort of marks that their landing pods would probably make." 
"You don't think it's the lawn mower?" asked Tricia. 
"If the marks were more round, I'd say, but these are just off-round, you see. Altogether more alien in shape." 
"It's just that you mentioned the lawn mower was playing up and needed fixing or it might start gouging holes in the lawn." 
"I did say that, Miss Tricia, and I stand by what I said. I'm not saying it's not the lawn mower for definite, I'm just saying what seems to me more likely given the shapes of the holes. They come in over these trees, you see, in their landing pods..." 
"Eric...," said Tricia, patiently. 
"Tell you what, though, Miss Tricia," said Eric, "I will take a look at the mower, like I meant to last week, and leave you to get on with whatever you're wanting to." 
"Thank you, Eric," said Tricia. "I'm going to bed now, in fact. Help yourself to anything you want in the kitchen." 
"Thank you, Miss Tricia, and good luck to you," said Eric. He bent over and picked something from the lawn. 
"There," he said. "Three-leaf clover. Good luck you see." 
He peered at it closely to check that it was a real three-leaf clover and not just a regular four-leaf one that one of the leaves had fallen off. "If I were you, though, I'd watch for signs of alien activity in the area." He scanned the horizon keenly. "Particularly from over there in the Henley direction." 
"Thank you, Eric," said Tricia again. "I will." 
She went to bed and dreamt fitfully of parrots and other birds. In the afternoon she got up and prowled around restlessly, not certain what to do with the rest of the day, or indeed the rest of her life. She spent at least an hour dithering, trying to make up her mind whether to head up into town and go to Stavro's for the evening. This was the currently fashionable spot for high-flying media people, and seeing a 
few friends there might help her ease herself back into the swing of things. She decided at last she would go. It was good. It was fun there. She was very fond of Stavro himself, who was a Greek with a German father a fairly odd combination. Tricia had been to the Alpha a couple of nights earlier, which was Stavro's original club in New York, now run by his brother Karl, who thought of himself as a German with a Greek mother. Stavro would be very happy to be told that Karl was making a bit of a pig's ear of running the New York club, so Tricia would go and make him happy. There was little love lost between Stavro and Karl Mueller. 
OK. That's what she would do. 
She then spent another hour dithering about what to wear. At last she settled on a smart little black dress she'd got in New York. She phoned a friend to see who was likely to be at the club that evening, and was told that it was closed this evening for a private wedding party. 
She thought that trying to live life according to any plan you actually work out is like trying to buy ingredients for a recipe from the supermarket. You get one of those trolleys which simply will not go in the direction you push it and end up just having to buy completely different stuff. What do you do with it? What do you do with the recipe? She didn't know. 
Anyway, that night an alien spacecraft landed on her lawn. 
Chapter 5 
She watched it coming in from over the Henley direction with mild curiosity at first, wondering what those lights were. Living, as she did, not a million miles from Heathrow, she was used to seeing lights in the sky. Not usually so late in the evening, or so low, though, which was why she was mildly curious. 
When whatever it was began to come closer and closer her curiosity began to turn to bemusement. 
"Hmmm," she thought, which was about as far as she could get with thinking. She was still feeling dopey and jet-lagged and the messages that one part of her brain was busy sending to another were not necessarily arriving on time or the right way up. She left the kitchen where she'd been fixing herself a coffee and went to open the back door which led out to the garden. She took a deep breath of cool evening air, stepped outside and looked up. 
There was something roughly the size of a large camper van parked about a hundred feet above her lawn. 
It was really there. Hanging there. Almost silent. 
Something moved deep inside her. 
Her arms dropped slowly down to her side. She didn't notice the scalding coffee slopping over her foot. She was hardly breathing as slowly, inch by inch, foot by foot, the craft came downwards. Its lights were playing softly over the ground as if probing and feeling it. They played over her. 
It seemed beyond all hope that she should be given her chance again. Had he found her? Had he come back? The craft dropped down and down until at last it had settled quietly on her lawn. It didn't look exactly like the one she had seen departing all those years ago, she thought, but flashing lights in the night sky are hard to resolve into clear shapes. 
Silence.â¨Then a click and a hum. 
Then another click and another hum. Click hum, click hum. 
A doorway slid open, spilling light towards her across the lawn. 
She waited, tingling. 
A figure stood silhouetted in the light, then another, and another. 
Wide eyes blinked slowly at her. Hands were slowly raised in greeting. 
"McMillan?" a voice said at last, a strange, thin voice that managed the syllables with difficulty. "Tricia McMillan. Ms. Tricia McMillan?" 
"Yes," said Tricia, almost soundlessly. "We have been monitoring you." "M... monitoring? Me?"â¨"Yes." 
They looked at her for a while, their large eyes moving up and down her very slowly. 
"You look smaller in real life," one said at last. "What?" said Tricia.â¨"Yes." 
"I... I don't understand," said Tricia. She hadn't expected any of this, of course, but even for something she hadn't expected to begin withâ¨it wasn't going the way she expected. At last she said, 
"Are you... are you from... Zaphod?" 
This question seemed to cause a little consternation among the three figures. They conferred with each other in some skittering language of their own and then turned back to her. 
"We don't think so. Not as far as we know," said one.â¨"Where is Zaphod?" said another, looking up into the night sky. "I... I don't know, said Tricia, helplessly.â¨"Is it far from here? Which direction? We don't know." 
Tricia realised with a sinking heart that they had no idea who she was talking about. Or even what she was talking about. And she had no idea what they were talking about. She put her hopes tightly away again and snapped her brain back into gear. There was no point in being disappointed. She had to wake up to the fact that she had here the journalistic scoop of the century. What should she do? Go back into the house for a video camera? Wouldn't they just be gone when 
she got back? She was thoroughly confused as to strategy. Keep'em talking, she thought. Figure it out later. 
"You've been monitoring... me?" 
"All of you. Everything on your planet. TV. Radio. Telecommunications. Computers. Video circuitry. Warehouses." 
"What?" 
"Car parks. Everything. We monitor everything." 
Tricia stared at them. 
"That must be very boring, isn't it?" she blurted out. 
"Yes." 
"So why..." 
"Except..." 
"Yes? Except what?" 
"Game shows. We quite like game shows." 
There was a terribly long silence as Tricia looked at the aliens and the aliens looked at her. 
"There's something I would just like to get from indoors," said Tricia very deliberately. "Tell you what. Would you, or one of you, like to come inside with me and have a look?" 
"Very much," they all said, enthusiastically. All three of them stood, slightly awkwardly in her sitting room, as she hurried around picking up a video camera, a 35mm camera, a tape recorder, every recording medium she could grab hold of. They were all thin and, under domestic lighting conditions, a sort of dim purplish green. 
"I really won't be a second, guys," Tricia said, as she rummaged through some drawers for spare tapes and films. 
The aliens were looking at the shelves that held her CDs and her old records. One of them nudged one of the others very slightly. 
"Look," he said. "Elvis."â¨Tricia stopped, and stared at them all over again. "You like Elvis?" she said.â¨"Yes," they said.â¨"Elvis Presley?"â¨"Yes." 
She shook her head in bewilderment as she tried to stuff a new tape into her video camera. 
"Some of your people," said one of her visitors, hesitantly, "think that Elvis has been kidnapped by space aliens." 
"What?" said Tricia. "Has he?" 
"It is possible." 
"Are you telling me that you have kidnapped Elvis?" gasped Tricia. She was trying to keep cool enough not to foul up her equipment, but this was all almost too much for her. 
"No. Not us," said her guests. "Aliens. It is a very interesting possibility. We talk of it often." 
"I must get this down," Tricia muttered to herself. She checked her video was properly loaded and working now. She pointed the camera at them. She didn't put it up to her eye because she didn't want to freak them out. But she was sufficiently experienced to be able to shoot accurately from the hip. 
"OK," she said. "Now tell me slowly and carefully who you are. You first," she said to the one on the left. "What's your name?" 
"I don't know." 
"You don't know." 
"No." 
"I see," said Tricia. "And what about you other two?" 
"We don't know." 
"Good. OK. Perhaps you can tell me where you are from?" 
They shook their heads. 
"You don't know where you're from?" 
They shook their heads again. 
"So," said Tricia. "What are you... er..." 
She was floundering but, being a professional, kept the camera steady while she did it. 
"We are on a mission," said one of the aliens. "A mission? A mission to do what?"â¨"We do not know."â¨Still she kept the camera steady. 
"So what are you doing here on Earth, then?" 
"We have come to fetch you." 
Rock steady, rock steady. Could have been on a tripod. She wondered if she should be using a tripod, in fact. She wondered that because it gave her a moment or two to digest what they had just said. No, she thought, hand-held gave her more flexibility. She also thought, Help, what am I going to do? 
"Why," she asked, calmly, "have you come to fetch me?" "Because we have lost our minds."â¨"Excuse me," said Tricia, "I'm going to have to get a tripod." 
They seemed happy enough to stand there doing nothing while Tricia quickly found a tripod and mounted the camera on it. Her face was completely immobile, but she did not have the faintest idea what was going on or what to think about it. 
"OK," she said, when she was ready. "Why..." "We liked your interview with the astrologer." "You saw it?" 
"We see everything. We are very interested in astrology. We like it. It is very interesting. Not everything is interesting. Astrology is interesting. What the stars tell us. What the stars foretell. We could do with some information like that." 
"But..." 
Tricia didn't know where to start. 
Own up, she thought. There's no point in trying to second guess any of this stuff. 
So she said, "But I don't know anything about astrology." "We do."â¨"You do?" 
"Yes. We follow our horoscopes. We are very avid. We see all your newspapers and your magazines and are very avid with them. But our leader says we have a problem." 
"You have a leader?" "Yes."â¨"What's his name?" "We do not know." 
"What does he say his name is, for Christ's sake? Sorry I'll need to edit that. What does he say his name is?" 
"He does not know." 
"So how do you all know he's the leader?" 
"He seized control. He said someone has to do something round here." 
"Ah!", said Tricia, seizing on a clue. "Where is 'here'?" "Rupert."â¨"What?" 
"Your people call it Rupert. The tenth planet from your sun. We have settled there for many years. It is highly cold and uninteresting there. But good for monitoring." 
"Why are you monitoring us?" 
"It is all we know to do." 
"OK," said Tricia. "Right. What is the problem that your leader says you have?" 
"Triangulation." 
"I beg your pardon?" 
"Astrology is a very precise science. We know this." 
"Well..." said Tricia, then left it at that. 
"But it is precise for you here on Earth." 
"Ye... e... s..." She had a horrible feeling she was getting a vague glimmering of something. 
"So when Venus is rising in Capricorn, for instance, that is from Earth. How does that work if we are out on Rupert? What if the Earth is rising in Capricorn? It is hard for us to know. Amongst the things we have forgotten, which we think are many and profound, is trigonometry." 
"Let me get this straight," said Tricia. "You want me to come with you to... Rupert..." 
"Yes." 
"To recalculate your horoscopes for you to take account of the relative positions of Earth and Rupert?" 
"Yes."â¨"Do I get an exclusive?" 
"Yes." 
"I'm your girl," said Tricia, thinking that at the very least she could sell it to the National Enquirer. 
As she boarded the craft that would take her off to the furthest limits of the Solar System, the first thing that met her eyes was a bank of video monitors across which thousands of images were sweeping.â¨A fourth alien was sitting watching them, but was focused on one particular screen that held a steady image. It was a replay of the impromptu interview which Tricia had just conducted with his three colleagues. He looked up when he saw her apprehensively climbing in. 
"Good evening, Ms. McMillan," he said. "Nice camera work." 
Chapter 6 
Ford Prefect hit the ground running. The ground was about three inches further from the ventilation shaft than he remembered it so he misjudged the point at which he would hit the ground, started running too soon, stumbled awkwardly and twisted his ankle. Damn! He ran off down the corridor anyway, hobbling slightly. 
All over the building, alarms were erupting into their usual frenzy of excitement. He dived for cover behind the usual storage cabinets, glanced around to check that he was unseen, and started rapidly to fish around inside his satchel for the usual things he needed. 
His ankle, unusually, was hurting like hell. 
The ground was not only three inches further from the ventilation shaft than he remembered, it was also on a different planet than he remembered, but it was the three inches that had caught him by surprise. The offices of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy were quite often shifted at very short notice to another planet, for reasons of local climate, local hostility, power bills or tax, but they were always reconstructed exactly the same way, almost to the very molecule. For many of the company's employees, the layout of their offices represented the only constant they knew in a severely distorted personal universe. 
Something, though, was odd. 
This was not in itself surprising, thought Ford as he pulled out his lightweight throwing towel. Virtually everything in his life was, to a greater or lesser extent, odd. It was just that this was odd in a slightly different way than he was used to things being odd, which was, well, strange. He couldn't quite get it into focus immediately. 
He got out his No. 3 gauge prising tool. The alarms were going in the same old way that he knew well. There was a kind of music to them that he could almost hum along to. That was all very familiar. The world outside had been a new one on Ford. He had not been to 
Saquo-Pilia Hensha before, and he had liked it. It had a kind of carnival atmosphere to it. 
He took from his satchel a toy bow and arrow which he had bought in a street market. 
He had discovered that the reason for the carnival atmosphere on Saquo-Pilia Hensha was that the local people were celebrating the annual feast of the Assumption of St Antwelm. St Antwelm had been, during his lifetime, a great and popular king who had made a great and popular assumption. What King Antwelm had assumed was that what everybody wanted, all other things being equal, was to be happy and enjoy themselves and have the best possible time together. On his death he had willed his entire personal fortune to financing an annual festival to remind every one of this, with lots of good food and dancing and very silly games like Hunt the Wocket. His Assumption had been such a brilliantly good one that he was made into a saint for it. Not only that, but all the people who had previously been made saints for doing things like being stoned to death in a thoroughly miserable way or living upside down in barrels of dung were instantly demoted and were now thought to be rather embarrassing. 
The familiar H-shaped building of the Hitchhiker's Guide offices rose above the outskirts of the city, and Ford Prefect had broken into it in the familiar way. He always entered via the ventilation system rather than the main lobby because the main lobby was patrolled by robots whose job it was to quiz incoming employees about their expense accounts. Ford Prefect's expense accounts were notoriously complex and difficult affairs and he had found, on the whole, that the lobby robots were ill-equipped to understand the arguments he wished to put forward in relation to them. He preferred, therefore, to make his entrance by another route. 
This meant setting off nearly every alarm in the building, but not the one in the accounts department, which was the way that Ford preferred it. 
He hunkered down behind the storage cabinet, he licked the rubber suction cup of the toy arrow, and then fitted it to the string of the bow. 
Within about thirty seconds a security robot the size of a small melon came flying down the corridor at about waist height, scanning left and right for anything unusual as it did so. 
With impeccable timing Ford shot the toy arrow across its path. The arrow flew across the corridor and stuck, wobbling, on the opposite wall. As it flew, the robot's sensors locked on to it instantly and the robot twisted through ninety degrees to follow it, see what the hell it was and where it was going. 
This bought Ford one precious second, during which the robot was looking in the opposite direction from him. He hurled the towel over the flying robot and caught it. 
Because of the various sensory protuberances with which the robot was festooned, it couldn't manoeuvre inside the towel, and it just twitched back and forth without being able to turn and face its captor. 
Ford hauled it quickly towards him and pinned it down to the ground. It was beginning to whine pitifully. With one swift and practised movement, Ford reached under the towel with his No. 3 gauge prising tool and flipped off the small plastic panel on top of the robot which gave access to its logic circuits. 
Now logic is a wonderful thing but it has, as the processes of evolution discovered, certain drawbacks. 
Anything that thinks logically can be fooled by something else which thinks at least as logically as it does. The easiest way to fool a completely logical robot is to feed it the same stimulus sequence over and over again so it gets locked in a loop. This was best demonstrated by the famous Herring Sandwich experiments conducted millennia ago at MISPWOSO (The MaxiMegalon Institute of Slowly and Painfully Working Out the Surprisingly Obvious). 
A robot was programmed to believe that it liked herring sandwiches. This was actually the most difficult part of the whole experiment. Once the robot had been programmed to believe that it liked herring sandwiches, a herring sandwich was placed in front of it. Whereupon the robot thought to itself, "Ah! A herring sandwich! I like herring sandwiches." 
It would then bend over and scoop up the herring sandwich in its herring sandwich scoop, and then straighten up again. Unfortunately for the robot, it was fashioned in such a way that the action of straightening up caused the herring sandwich to slip straight back off its herring sandwich scoop and fall on to the floor in front of the robot. Whereupon the robot thought to itself, "Ah! A herring sandwich..., etc., and repeated the same action over and over and over again. The 
only thing that prevented the herring sandwich from getting bored with the whole damn business and crawling off in search of other ways of passing the time was that the herring sandwich, being just a bit of dead fish between a couple of slices of bread, was marginally less alert to what was going on than was the robot. 
The scientists at the Institute thus discovered the driving force behind all change, development and innovation in life, which was this: herring sandwiches. They published a paper to this effect, which was widely criticised as being extremely stupid. They checked their figures and realised that what they had actually discovered was "boredom", or rather, the practical function of boredom. In a fever of excitement they then went on to discover other emotions, Like "irritability", "depression", "reluctance", "ickiness" and so on. The next big breakthrough came when they stopped using herring sandwiches, whereupon a whole welter of new emotions became suddenly available to them for study, such as "relief", "joy", "friskiness", "appetite", "satisfaction", and most important of all, the desire for "happiness". 
This was the biggest breakthrough of all. 
Vast wodges of complex computer code governing robot behaviour in all possible contingencies could be replaced very simply. All that robots needed was the capacity to be either bored or happy, and a few conditions that needed to be satisfied in order to bring those states about. They would then work the rest out for themselves. 
The robot which Ford had got trapped under his towel was not, at the moment a happy robot. It was happy when it could move about. It was happy when it could see other things. It was particularly happy when it could see other things moving about, particularly if the other things were moving about doing things they shouldn't do because it could then, with considerable delight, report them. 
Ford would soon fix that. 
He squatted over the robot and held it between his knees. The towel was still covering all of its sensory mechanisms, but Ford had now got its logic circuits exposed. The robot was whirring grungily and pettishly, but it could only fidget, it couldn't actually move. Using the prising tool, Ford eased a small chip out from its socket. As soon as it came out, the robot went quiet and just sat there in a coma. 
The chip Ford had taken out was the one which contained the instructions for all the conditions that had to be fulfilled in order for the robot to feel happy. The robot would be happy when a tiny electrical charge from a point just to the left of the chip reached another point just to the right of the chip. The chip determined whether the charge got there or not. 
Ford pulled out a small length of wire that had been threaded into the towel. He dug one end of it into the top left hole of the chip socket and the other into the bottom right hole. 
That was all it took. Now the robot would be happy whatever happened. 
Ford quickly stood up and whisked the towel away. The robot rose ecstatically into the air, pursuing a kind of wriggly path. 
It turned and saw Ford.â¨"Mr. Prefect, sir! I'm so happy to see you!" "Good to see you, little fella," said Ford. 
The robot rapidly reported back to its central control that everything was now for the best in this best of all possible worlds, the alarms rapidly quelled themselves, and life returned to normal. 
At least, almost to normal. 
There was something odd about the place. 
The little robot was gurgling with electric delight. Ford hurried on down the corridor, letting the thing bob along in his wake telling him how delicious everything was, and how happy it was to be able to tell him that. 
Ford, however, was not happy. 
He passed faces of people he didn't know. They didn't look like his sort of people. They were too well groomed. Their eyes were too dead. Every time he thought he saw someone he recognised in the distance, and hurried along to say hello, it would turn out to be someone else, with an altogether neater hairstyle and a much more thrusting, purposeful look than, well, than anybody Ford knew. 
A staircase had been moved a few inches to the left. A ceiling had been lowered slightly. A Lobby had been remodelled. All these things were not worrying in themselves, though they were a little disorienting. The thing that was worrying was the decor. It used to be brash and glitzy. Expensive because the Guide sold so well through 
the civilised and post-civilised Galaxy but expensive and fun. Wild games machines lined the corridors. Insanely painted grand pianos hung from ceilings, vicious sea creatures from the planet Viv reared up out of pools in tree-filled atria, robot butlers in stupid shirts roamed the corridors seeking whose hands they might press frothing drinks into. People used to have pet vastdragons on leads and pterospondes on perches in their offices. People knew how to have a good time, and if they didn't there were courses they could sign up for which would put that right. 
There was none of that now. 
Somebody had been through the place doing some iniquitous kind of taste job on it. 
Ford turned sharply into a small alcove, cupped his hand and yanked the flying robot in with him. He squatted down and peered at the burbling cybernaut. 
"What's been happening here?" he demanded. 
"Oh just the nicest things, sir, just the nicest possible things. Can I sit on your lap, please?" 
"No," said Ford, brushing the thing away. It was overjoyed to be spurned in this way and started to bob and burble and swoon. Ford grabbed it again and stuck it firmly in the air a foot in front of his face. It tried to stay where it was put but couldn't help quivering slightly. 
"Something's changed, hasn't it?" Ford hissed. 
"Oh yes," squealed the little robot, "in the most fabulous and wonderful way. I feel so good about it." 
"Well what was it like before, then?" 
"Scrumptious." 
"But you like the way it's changed?" demanded Ford. 
"I like everything," moaned the robot. "Especially when you shout at me like that. Do it again, please." 
"Just tell me what's happened!" "Oh thank you, thank you!" Ford sighed. 
"OK, OK," panted the robot. "The Guide has been taken over. There's a new management. It's all so gorgeous I could just melt. The 
old management was also fabulous of course, though I'm not sure if I thought so at the time." 
"That was before you had a bit of wire stuck in your head." 
"How true. How wonderfully true. How wonderfully, bubblingly, frothingly, burstingly true. What a truly ecstasy-inducingly correct observation." 
"What's happened?" insisted Ford. "Who is this new management? When did they take over? I... oh, never mind," he added, as the little robot started to gibbet with uncontrollable joy and rub itself against his knee. "I'll go and find out for myself." Ford hurled himself at the door of the editor-in-chief's office, tucked himself into a tight ball as the frame splintered and gave way, rolled rapidly across the floor to where the drinks trolley laden with some of the Galaxy's most potent and expensive beverages habitually stood, seized hold of the trolley and, using it to give himself cover, trundled it and himself across the main exposed part of the office floor to where the valuable and extremely rude statue of Leda and the Octopus stood, and took shelter behind it. Meanwhile the little security robot, entering at chest height, was suicidally delighted to draw gunfire away from Ford. 
That, at least, was the plan, and a necessary one. The current editor-in-chief, Stagyar-zil-Doggo, was a dangerously unbalanced man who took a homicidal view of contributing staff turning up in his office without pages of fresh, proofed copy, and had a battery of laser Guided guns linked to special scanning devices in the door frame to deter anybody who was merely bringing extremely good reasons why they hadn't written any. Thus was a high level of output maintained. 
Unfortunately the drinks trolley wasn't there. 
*** 
Ford hurled himself desperately sideways and somersaulted towards the statue of Leda and the Octopus, which also wasn't there. He rolled and hurtled around the room in a kind of random panic, tripped, span, hit the window, which fortunately was built to withstand rocket attacks, rebounded, and fell in a bruised and winded heap behind a smart grey crushed leather sofa, which hadn't been there before. 
After a few seconds he slowly peeked up above the top of the sofa. As well as there being no drinks trolley and no Leda and the Octopus, 
there had also been a startling absence of gunfire. He frowned. This was all utterly wrong. 
"Mr. Prefect, I assume," said a voice. 
The voice came from a smooth-faced individual behind a large ceramo-teak-bonded desk. Stagyar-zil-Doggo may well have been a hell of an individual, but no one, for a whole variety of reasons, would ever have called him smooth-faced. This was not Stagyar-zil-Doggo. 
"I assume from the manner of your entrance that you do not have new material for the, er, Guide, at the moment," said the smooth- faced individual. He was sitting with his elbows resting on the table and holding his fingertips together in a manner which, inexplicably, has never been made a capital offence. 
"I've been busy," said Ford, rather weakly. He staggered to his feet, brushing himself down. Then he thought, what the hell was he saying things weakly for? He had to get on top of this situation. He had to find out who the hell this person was, and he suddenly thought of a way of doing it. 
"Who the hell are you?", he demanded. 
"I am your new editor-in-chief. That is, if we decide to retain your services. My name is Vann Harl." He didn't put his hand out. He just added, "What have you done to that security robot?" 
The little robot was rolling very, very slowly round the ceiling and moaning quietly to itself. 
"I've made it very happy," snapped Ford. "It's a kind of mission I have. Where's Stagyar? More to the point, where's his drinks trolley?" 
"Mr. zil-Doggo is no longer with this organisation. His drinks trolley is, I imagine, helping to console him for this fact." 
"Organisation?" yelled Ford. "Organisation? What a bloody stupid word for a set-up like this!" 
"Precisely our sentiments. Under-structured, overresourced, under-managed, over-inebriated. And that," said Harl, "was just the editor." 
"I'll do the jokes," snarled Ford. 
"No," said Harl. "You will do the restaurant column." 
He tossed a piece of plastic on to the desk in front of him. Ford did not move to pick it up. 
"You what?" said Ford. 
"No. Me Harl. You Prefect. You do restaurant column. Me editor. Me sit here tell you do restaurant column. You get?" 
"Restaurant column?" said Ford, too bewildered to be really angry yet. 
"Siddown, Prefect," said Harl. He swung round in his swivel chair, got to his feet, and stood staring out at the tiny specks enjoying the carnival twenty-three stories below. 
"Time to get this business on its feet, Prefect," he snapped. "We at InfiniDim Enterprises are..."â¨"You at what?"â¨"InfiniDim Enterprises. We have bought out the Guide." "InfiniDim?" 
"We spent millions on that name, Prefect. Start liking it or start packing." 
Ford shrugged. He had nothing to pack. 
"The Galaxy is changing," said Harl. "We've got to change with it. Go with the market. The market is moving up. New aspirations. New technology. The future is..." 
"Don't tell me about the future," said Ford. "I've been all over the future. Spend half my time there. It's the same as anywhere else. Anywhen else. Whatever. Just the same old stuff in faster cars and smellier air." 
"That's one future," said Harl. "That's your future, if you accept it. You've got to learn to think multi-dimensionally. There are limitless futures stretching out in every direction from this moment-and from this moment and from this. Billions of them, bifurcating every instant! Every possible position of every possible electron balloons out into billions of probabilities! Billions and billions of shining, gleaming futures! You know what that means?" 
"You're dribbling down your chin."â¨"Billions and billions of markets!"â¨"I see," said Ford. "So you sell billions and billions of Guides." 
"No," said Harl, reaching for his handkerchief and not finding one. "Excuse me," he said, "but this gets me so excited." Ford handed him his towel. 
"The reason we don't sell billions and billions of Guides," continued Harl, after wiping his mouth, "is the expense. What we do is we sell one Guide billions and billions of times. We exploit the multidimensional nature of the Universe to cut down on manufacturing costs. And we don't sell to penniless hitchhikers. What a stupid notion that was! Find the one section of the market that, more or less by definition, doesn't have any money, and try and sell to it. No. We sell to the affluent business traveller and his vacationing wife in a billion, billion different futures. This is the most radical, dynamic and thrusting business venture in the entire multidimensional infinity of space/time/probability ever." 
"And you want me to be its restaurant critic," said Ford. "We would value your input."â¨"Kill!" shouted Ford. He shouted it at his towel.â¨The towel leapt up out of Harl's hands. 
This was not because it had any motive force of its own, but because Harl was so startled at the idea that it might. The next thing that startled him was the sight of Ford Prefect hurtling across the desk at him fists first. In fact Ford was just lunging for the credit card, but you don't get to occupy the sort of position that Harl occupied in the sort of organisation in which Harl occupied it without developing a healthily paranoid view of life. He took the sensible precaution of hurling himself backwards, and striking his head a sharp blow on the rocket-proof glass, then subsided into a series of worrying and highly personal dreams. 
Ford lay on the desk, surprised at how swimmingly everything had gone. He glanced quickly at the piece of plastic he now held in his hand it was a Dine-O-Charge credit card with his name already embossed on it, and an expiry date two years from now, and was possibly the single most exciting thing Ford had ever seen in his life then he clambered over the desk to see to Harl. 
He was breathing fairly easily. It occurred to Ford that he might breathe more easily yet without the weight of his wallet bearing down on his chest, so he slipped it out of Harl's breast pocket and flipped through it. Fair amount of cash. Credit tokens. Ultragolf club membership. Other club memberships. Photos of someone's wife and family presumably Harl's, but it was hard to be sure these days. 
Busy executives often didn't have time for a full-time wife and family and would just rent them for weekends. 
Ha! 
He couldn't believe what he'd just found. 
He slowly drew out from the wallet a single and insanely exciting piece of plastic that was nestling amongst a bunch of receipts. 
It wasn't insanely exciting to look at. It was rather dull in fact. It was smaller and a little thicker than a credit card and semi- transparent. If you held it up to the light you could see a lot of holographically encoded information and images buried pseudo- inches deep beneath its surface. 
It was an Ident-i-Eeze, and was a very naughty and silly thing for Harl to have lying around in his wallet, though it was perfectly understandable. There were so many different ways in which you were required to provide absolute proof of your identity these days that life could easily become extremely tiresome just from that factor alone, never mind the deeper existential problems of trying to function as a coherent consciousness in an epistemologically ambiguous physical universe. Just look at cash point machines, for instance. Queues of people standing around waiting to have their fingerprints read, their retinas scanned, bits of skin scraped from the nape of the neck and undergoing instant (or nearly instant a good six or seven seconds in tedious reality) genetic analysis, then having to answer trick questions about members of their family they didn't even remember they had, and about their recorded preferences for tablecloth colours. And that was just to get a bit of spare cash for the weekend. If you were trying to raise a loan for a jetcar, sign a missile treaty or pay an entire restaurant bill things could get really trying. 
Hence the Ident-i-Eeze. This encoded every single piece of information about you, your body and your life into one all-purpose machine-readable card that you could then carry around in your wallet, and therefore represented technology's greatest triumph to date over both itself and plain common sense. 
Ford pocketed it. A remarkably good idea had just occurred to him. He wondered how long Harl would remain unconscious. 
"Hey!" he shouted to the little melon-sized robot still slobbering with euphoria up on the ceiling. "You want to stay happy?" 
The robot gurgled that it did. 
"Then stick with me and do everything I tell you without fail." 
The robot said that it was quite happy where it was up on the ceiling thank you very much. It had never realised before how much sheer titillation there was to be got from a good ceiling and it wanted to explore its feelings about ceilings in greater depth. 
"You stay there," said Ford, "and you'll soon be recaptured and have your conditional chip replaced. You want to stay happy, come now." 
The robot let out a long heartfelt sigh of impassioned tristesse and sank reluctantly away from the ceiling. 
"Listen," said Ford, "can you keep the rest of the security system happy for a few minutes?" 
"One of the joys of true happiness," trilled the robot, "is sharing. I brim, I froth, I overflow with..." 
"OK," said Ford. "Just spread a little happiness around the security network. Don't give it any information. Just make it feel good so it doesn't feel the need to ask for any." 
He picked up his towel and ran cheerfully for the door. Life had been a little dull of late. It showed every sign now of becoming extremely froody. 
Chapter 7 
Arthur Dent had been in some hell-holes in his life, but he had never before seen a spaceport which had a sign saying, "Even travelling despondently is better than arriving here." To welcome visitors the arrivals hall featured a picture of the President of NowWhat, smiling. It was the only picture anybody could find of him, and it had been taken shortly after he had shot himself so although the photo had been retouched as well as could be managed the smile it wore was rather a ghastly one. The side of his head had been drawn back in crayon. No replacement had been found for the photograph because no replacement had been found for the President. There was only one ambition which anyone on the planet ever had, and that was to leave. 
Arthur checked himself into a small motel on the outskirts of town, and sat glumly on the bed, which was damp, and flipped through the little information brochure, which was also damp. It said that the planet of NowWhat had been named after the opening words of the first settlers to arrive there after struggling across light years of space to reach the furthest unexplored outreaches of the Galaxy. The main town was called OhWell. There weren't any other towns to speak of. Settlement on NowWhat had not been a success and the sort of people who actually wanted to live on NowWhat were not the sort of people you would want to spend time with. 
Trading was mentioned in the brochure. The main trade that was carried out was in the skins of the NowWhattian boghog but it wasn't a very successful one because no one in their right minds would want to buy a NowWhattian boghog skin. The trade only hung on by its fingernails because there was always a significant number of people in the Galaxy who were not in their right minds. Arthur had felt very uncomfortable looking around at some of the other occupants of the small passenger compartment of the ship. 
The brochure described some of the history of the planet. Whoever had written it had obviously started out trying to drum up a little 
enthusiasm for the place by stressing that it wasn't actually cold and wet all the time, but could find little positive to add to this so the tone of the piece quickly degenerated into savage irony. 
It talked about the early years of settlement. It said that the major activities pursued on NowWhat were those of catching, skinning and eating NowWhattian boghogs, which were the only extant form of animal life on NowWhat, all other having long ago died of despair. The boghogs were tiny, vicious creatures, and the small margin by which they fell short of being completely inedible was the margin by which life on the planet subsisted. So what were the rewards, however small, that made life on NowWhat worth living? Well, there weren't any. Not a one. Even making yourself some protective clothing out of boghog skins was an exercise in disappointment and futility, since the skins were unaccountably thin and leaky. This caused a lot of puzzled conjecture amongst the settlers. What was the boghog's secret of keeping warm? If anyone had ever learnt the language the boghogs spoke to each other they would have discovered that there was no trick. The boghogs were as cold and wet as anyone else on the planet. No one had had the slightest desire to learn the language of the boghogs for the simple reason that these creatures communicated by biting each other very hard on the thigh. Life on NowWhat being what it was, most of what a boghog might have to say about it could easily be signified by these means. 
Arthur flipped through the brochure till he found what he was looking for. At the back there were a few maps of the planet. They were fairly rough and ready because they weren't likely to be of much interest to anyone, but they told him what he wanted to know. 
He didn't recognise it at first because the maps were the other way up from the way he would have expected and looked, therefore thoroughly unfamiliar. Of course, up and down, north and south, are absolutely arbitrary designations, but we are used to seeing things the way we are used to seeing them, and Arthur had to turn the maps upside-down to make sense of them. 
There was one huge landmass off on the upper left-hand side of the page which tapered down to a tiny waist and then ballooned out again like a large comma. On the right-hand side was a collection of large shapes jumbled familiarly together. The outlines were not exactly the same, and Arthur didn't know if this was because the map 
was so rough, or because the sea-level was higher or because, well, things were just different here. But the evidence was inarguable. 
This was definitely the Earth. 
Or rather, it most definitely was not. 
It merely looked a lot like the Earth and occupied the same coordinates in space/time. What co-ordinates it occupied in Probability was anybody's guess. 
He sighed. 
This, he realised, was about as close to home as he was likely to get. Which meant that he was about as far from home as he couldâ¨possibly be. Glumly he slapped the brochure shut and wondered what on earth he was going to do next. 
He allowed himself a hollow laugh at what he had just thought. He looked at his old watch, and shook it a bit to wind it. It had taken him, according to his own time-scale, a year of hard travelling to get here. A year since the accident in hyperspace in which Fenchurch had completely vanished. One minute she had been sitting there next to him in the SlumpJet; the next minute the ship had done a perfectly normal hyperspace hop and when he had next looked she was not there. The seat wasn't even warm. Her name wasn't even on the passenger list. 
The spaceline had been wary of him when he had complained. A lot of awkward things happen in space travel, and a lot of them make a lot of money for lawyers. But when they had asked him what Galactic Sector he and Fenchurch had been from and he had said ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha they had relaxed completely in a way that Arthur wasn't at all sure he liked. They even laughed a little, though sympathetically, of course. They pointed to the clause in the ticket contract which said that the entities whose lifespans had originated in any of the Plural zones were advised not to travel in hyperspace and did so at their own risk. Every-body, they said, knew that. They tittered slightly and shook their heads. 
As Arthur had left their offices he found he was trembling slightly. Not only had he lost Fenchurch in the most complete and utter way possible, but he felt that the more time he spent away out in the Galaxy the more it seemed that the number of things he didn't know anything about actually increased. 
Just as he was lost for a moment in these numb memories a knock came on the door of his motel room, which then opened immediately. A fat and dishevelled man came in carrying Arthur's one small case. 
He got as far as, "Where shall I put " when there was a sudden violent flurry and he collapsed heavily against the door, trying to beat off a small and mangy creature that had leapt snarling out of the wet night and buried its teeth in his thigh, even through the thick layers of leather padding he wore there. There was a brief, ugly confusion of jabbering and thrashing. The man shouted frantically and pointed. Arthur grabbed a hefty stick that stood next to the door expressly for this purpose and beat at the boghog with it. 
The boghog suddenly disengaged and limped backwards, dazed and forlorn. It turned anxiously in the corner of the room, its tail tucked up right under its back legs, and stood looking nervously up at Arthur, jerking its head awkwardly and repeatedly to one side. Its jaw seemed to be dislocated. It cried a little and scraped its damp tail across the floor. By the door, the fat man with Arthur's suitcase was sitting and cursing, trying to staunch the flow of blood from his thigh. His clothes were already wet from the rain. 
Arthur stared at the boghog, not knowing what to do. The boghog looked at him questioningly. It tried to approach him, waking mournful little whimpering noises. It moved its jaw pain-fully. It made a sudden leap for Arthur's thigh, but its dislocated jaw was too weak to get a grip and it sank, whining sadly, down to the floor. The fat man jumped to his feet, grabbed the stick, beat the boghog's brains into a sticky, pulpy mess on the thin carpet, and then stood there breathing heavily as if daring the animal to move again, just once. 
A single boghog eyeball sat looking reproachfully at Arthur from out of the mashed ruins of its head. 
"What do you think it was trying to say?" asked Arthur in a small voice. 
"Ah, nothing much," said the man "Just its way of trying to be friendly. This is just our way of being friendly back," he added, gripping the stick. 
"When's the next flight out?" asked Arthur. "Thought you'd only just arrived," said the man. 
"Yes," said Arthur. "It was only going to be a brief visit. I just wanted to see if this was the right place or not. Sorry." 
"You mean you're on the wrong planet?" said the man lugubriously. "Funny how many people say that. Specially the people who live here." He eyed the remains of the boghog with a deep, ancestral resentment. 
"Oh no," said Arthur, "it's the right planet all right." He picked up the damp brochure lying on the bed and put it in his pocket. "It's OK, thanks, I'll take that," he said, taking his case from the man. He went to the door and looked out into the cold, wet night. 
"Yes, it's the right planet, all right," he said again. "Right planet, wrong universe." 
A single bird wheeled in the sky above him as he set off back for the spaceport. 
Chapter 8 
Ford had his own code of ethics. It wasn't much of one, but it was his and he stuck by it, more or less. One rule he made was never to buy his own drinks. He wasn't sure if that counted as an ethic, but you have to go with what you've got. He was also firmly and utterly opposed to all and any forms of cruelty to any animals whatsoever except geese. And furthermore he would never steal from his employers. 
Well, not exactly steal. 
If his accounts supervisor didn't start to hyperventilate and put out a seal-all-exits security alert when Ford handed in his expenses claim then Ford felt he wasn't doing his job properly. But actually stealing was another thing. That was biting the hand that feeds you. Sucking very hard on it, even nibbling it in an affectionate kind of a way was OK, but you didn't actually bite it. Not when that hand was the Guide. The Guide was something sacred and special. 
But that, thought Ford as he ducked and weaved his way down through the building, was about to change. And they had only themselves to blame. Look at all this stuff. Lines of neat grey office cubicles and executive workstation pods. The whole place was dreary with the hum of memos and minutes of meetings flitting through its electronic networks. Out in the street they were playing Hunt the Wocket for Zark's sake, but here in the very heart of the Guide offices no one was even recklessly kicking a ball around the corridors or wearing inappropriately coloured beachware. 
"InfiniDim Enterprises," Ford snarled to himself as he stalked rapidly down one corridor after another. Door after door magically opened to him without question. Elevators took him happily to places they should not. Ford was trying to pursue the most tangled and complicated route he could, heading generally down-wards through the building. His happy little robot took care of everything, spreading waves of acquiescent joy through all the security circuits it encountered. 
Ford thought it needed a name and decided to call it Emily Saunders, after a girl he had very fond memories of. Then he thought that Emily Saunders was an absurd name for a security robot, and decided to call it Colin instead, after Emily's dog. 
He was moving deep into the bowels of the building now, into areas he had never entered before, areas of higher and higher security. He was beginning to encounter puzzled looks from the operatives he passed. At this level of security you didn't even call them people anymore. And they were probably doing stuff that only operatives would do. When they went home to their families in the evening they became people again, and when their little children looked up to them with their sweet shining eyes and said "Daddy, what did you do all day today?" they just said, "I performed my duties as an operative," and left it at that. 
The truth of the matter was that all sorts of highly dodgy stuff went on behind the cheery, happy-go-lucky front that the Guide liked to put up or used to like to put up before this new InfiniDim Enterprises bunch marched in and started to make the whole thing highly dodgy. There were all kinds of tax scams and rackets and graft and shady deals supporting the shining edifice, and down in the secure research and data-processing levels of the building was where it all went on. 
Every few years the Guide would set up its business, and indeed its building on a new world, and all would be sunshine and laughter for a while as the Guide would put down its roots in the local culture and economy, provide employment, a sense of glamour and adventure and, in the end, not quite as much actual revenue as the locals had expected. 
When the Guide moved on, taking its building with it, it left a little like a thief in the night. Exactly like a thief in the night in fact. It usually left in the very early hours of the morning, and the following day there always turned out to be a very great deal of stuff missing. Whole cultures and economies would collapse in its wake, often within a week, leaving once thriving planets desolate and shell- shocked but still somehow feeling they had been part of some great adventure. 
The "operatives" who shot puzzled glances at Ford as he marched on into the depths of the building's most sensitive areas were 
reassured by the presence of Colin, who was flying along with him in a buzz of emotional fulfilment and easing his path for him at every stage. 
Alarms were starting to go off in other parts of the building.â¨Perhaps that meant that Vann Harl had already been discovered, which might be a problem. Ford had been hoping he would be able to slip the Ident-i-Eeze back into his pocket before he came round. Well, that was a problem for later, and he didn't for the moment have the faintest idea how he was going to solve it. For the moment he wasn't going to worry. Wherever he went with little Colin, he wasâ¨surrounded by a cocoon of sweetness and light and, most importantly, willing and acquiescent elevators and positively obsequious doors. 
Ford even began to whistle, which was probably his mistake. Nobody likes a whistler, particularly not the divinity that shapes our ends. 
The next door wouldn't open. 
And that was a pity, because it was the very one that Ford had been making for. It stood there before him, grey and resolutely closed with a sign on it saying: 
NO ADMITTANCE.â¨NOT EVEN TO AUTHORISED PERSONNEL. YOU ARE WASTING YOUR TIME HERE. GO AWAY. 
Colin reported that the doors had been getting generally a lot grimmer down in these lower reaches of the building. 
They were about ten stories below ground level now. The air was refrigerated and the tasteful grey hessian wall-weave had given way to brutal grey bolted steel walls. Colin's rampant euphoria had subsided into a kind of determined cheeriness. He said that he was beginning to tire a little. It was taking all his energy to pump the slightest bonhomie whatsoever into the doors down here. 
Ford kicked at the door. It opened. 
"Mixture of pleasure and pain," he muttered. "Always does the trick." 
He walked in and Colin flew in after him. Even with a wire stuck straight into his pleasure electrode his happiness was a nervous kind of happiness. He bobbed around a little. 
The room was small, grey and humming. 
This was the nerve centre of the entire Guide. 
The computer terminals that lined the grey walls were windows on to every aspect of the Guide's operations. Here, on the left-hand side of the room, reports were gathered over the Sub-Etha-Net from field researchers in every corner of the Galaxy, fed straight up into the network of sub-editor's offices where they had all the good bits cut out by secretaries because the sub-editors were out having lunch. The remaining copy would then be shot across to the other half of the building the other leg of the "H" which was the legal department. The legal department would cut out anything that was still even remotely good from what remained and fire it back to the offices of the executive editors, who were also out at lunch. So the editors secretaries would read it and say it was stupid and cut most of what was left. 
When any of the editors finally staggered in from lunch they would exclaim "What is this feeble crap that X" where X was the name of the field researcher in question "has sent us from half-way across the bloody Galaxy? What's the point of having somebody spending three whole orbital periods out in the bloody Gagrakacka Mind Zones, with all that stuff going on out there, if this load of anaemic squitter is the best he can be bothered to send us. Disallow his expenses!" 
"What shall we do with the copy?" the secretary would ask. 
"Ah, put it out over the network. Got to have something going out there. I've got a headache, I'm going home." 
So the edited copy would go for one last slash and burn through the legal department, and then be sent back down here where it would be broadcast out over the Sub-Etha-Net for instantaneous retrieval anywhere in the Galaxy. That was handled by equipment which was monitored and controlled by the terminals on the right- hand side of the room. 
Meanwhile the order to disallow the researcher's expenses was relayed down to the computer terminal stuck off in the right-hand corner, and it was to this terminal that Ford Prefect now swiftly made his way. 
(If you are reading this on planet Earth then: 
a) Good luck to you. There is an awful lot of stuff you don't know anything about, but you are not alone in this. It's just that in your case the consequences of not knowing any of this stuff are particularly terrible, but then, hey, that's just the way the cookie gets completely stomped on and obliterated. 
b) Don't imagine you know what a computer terminal is. 
A computer terminal is not some clunky old television with a typewriter in front of it. It is an interface where the mind and body can connect with the universe and move bits of it about.) 
Ford hurried over to the terminal, sat in front of it and quickly dipped himself into its universe. 
It wasn't the normal universe he knew. It was a universe of densely enfolded worlds, of wild topographies, towering mountain peaks, heart stopping ravines, of moons shattering off into sea horses, hurtful blurting crevices, silently heaving oceans and bottomless hurtling hooping funts. 
He held still to get his bearings. He controlled his breathing, closed his eyes and looked again. 
So this was where accountants spent their time. There was clearly more to them than met the eye. He looked around carefully, trying not to let it all swell and swim and overwhelm him. 
He didn't know his way around this universe. He didn't even know the physical laws that determined its dimensional extents or behaviours, but his instinct told him to look for the most outstanding feature he could detect and make towards it. 
Way off in some indistinguishable distance was it a mile or a million or a mote in his eye? was a stunning peak that overarched the sky, climbed and climbed and spread out in flowering aigrettes3, agglomerates4, and arch imandrites5. 
He weltered towards it, hooling and thurling, and at last reached it in a meaninglessly long umthingth of time. 
He clung to it, arms outspread, gripping tightly on to its roughly gnarled and pitted surface. Once he was certain that he was secure he made the hideous mistake of looking down. 
While he had been weltering, hooling and thurling, the distance beneath him had not bothered him unduly, but now that he was 
gripping, the distance made his heart wilt and his brain bend. His fingers were white with pain and tension. His teeth were grinding and twisting against each other beyond his control. His eyes turned inwards with waves from the willowing extremities of nausea. 
With an immense effort of will and faith he simply let go and pushed. 
He felt himself float. Away. And then, counter-intuitively, upwards. And upwards. 
He threw his shoulders back, let his arms drop, gazed upwards and let himself be drawn loosely, higher and higher. 
Before long, insofar as such terms had any meaning in this virtual universe, a ledge loomed up ahead of him on which he could grip and on to which he could clamber. 
He rose, he gripped, he clambered. 
He panted a little. This was all a little stressful. 
He held tightly on to the ledge as he sat. He wasn't certain if this was to prevent himself from falling down off it or rising up from it, but he needed something to grip on to as he surveyed the world in which he found himself. 
The whirling, turning height span him and twisted his brain in upon itself till he found himself, eyes closed, whimpering and hugging the hideous wall of towering rock. 
He slowly brought his breathing back under control again. He told himself repeatedly that he was just in a graphic representation of a world. A virtual universe. A simulated reality. He could snap back out of it at any moment. 
He snapped back out of it. 
He was sitting in a blue leatherette foam filled swivel-seated office chair in front of a computer terminal. 
He relaxed. 
He was clinging to the face of an impossibly high peak perched on a narrow ledge above a drop of brain-swivelling dimensions. 
It wasn't just the landscape being so far beneath him he wished it would stop undulating and waving. 
He had to get a grip. Not on the rock wall that was an illusion. He had to get a grip on the situation, be able to look at the physical world he was in while drawing himself out of it emotionally. 
He clenched inwardly and then, just as he had let go of the rock face itself, he let go of the idea of the rock face and let himself just sit there clearly and freely. He looked out at the world. He was breathing well. He was cool. He was in charge again. 
He was in a four-dimensional topological model of the Guide's financial systems, and somebody or something would very shortly want to know why. 
And here they came. 
Swooping through virtual space towards him came a small flock of mean and steely-eyed creatures with pointy little heads, pencil moustaches and querulous demands as to who he was, what he was doing there, what his authorisation was, what the authorisation of his authorising agent was, what his inside leg measurement was and so on. Laser light flickered all over him as if he was a packet of biscuits at a supermarket check-out. The heavier duty laser guns were held, for the moment, in reserve. The fact that all of this was happening in virtual space made no difference. Being virtually killed by a virtual laser in virtual space is just as effective as the real thing, because you are as dead as you think you are. 
The laser readers were becoming very agitated as they flickered over his fingerprints, his retina and the follicle pattern where his hair line was receding. They didn't like what they were finding at all. The chattering and screeching of highly personal and insolent questions was rising in pitch. A little surgical steel scraper was reaching out towards the skin at the nape of his neck when Ford, holding his breath and praying very slightly, pulled Vann Harl's Ident-i-Eeze out of his pocket and waved it in front of them. 
Instantly every laser was diverted to the little card and Swept backwards and forwards over it and in it, examining and reading every molecule. 
Then, just as suddenly, they stopped. 
The entire flock of little virtual inspectors snapped to attention. 
"Nice to see you, Mr. Harl," they said in smarmy unison. "Is there anything we can do for you?" 
Ford smiled a slow and vicious smile. 
"Do you know," he said, "I rather think there is?" Five minutes later he was out of there. 
About thirty seconds to do the job, and three minutes thirty to cover his tracks. He could have done anything he liked in the virtual structure, more or less. He could have transferred ownership of the entire organisation into his own name, but he doubted if that would have gone unnoticed. He didn't want it anyway. It would have meant responsibility, working late nights at the office, not to mention massive and time-consuming fraud investigations and a fair amount of time in jail. He wanted something that nobody other than the computer would notice: that was the bit that took thirty seconds. 
The thing that took three minutes thirty was programming the computer not to notice that it had noticed anything. 
It had to want not to know about what Ford was up to, and then he could safely leave the computer to rationalise its own defences against the information ever emerging. It was a programming technique that had been reverse-engineered from the sort of psychotic mental blocks that otherwise perfectly normal people had been observed invariably to develop when elected to high political office. 
The other minute was spent discovering that the computer system already had a mental block. A big one. 
He would never have discovered it if he hadn't been busy engineering a mental block himself. He came across a whole slew of smooth and plausible denial procedures and diversionary subroutines exactly where he had been planning to install his own. The computer denied all knowledge of them, of course, then blankly refused to accept that there was anything even to deny knowledge of, and was generally so convincing that even Ford almost found himself thinking he must have made a mistake. 
He was impressed. 
He was so impressed, in fact, that he didn't bother to install his own mental block procedures, he just set up calls to the ones that were already there, which then called themselves when questioned, and so on. 
He quickly set about debugging the little bits of code he had installed himself, only to discover they weren't there. Cursing, he searched all over for them, but could find no trace of them at all. 
He was just about to start installing them all over again when he realised that the reason he couldn't find them was that they were working already. 
He grinned with satisfaction. 
He tried to discover what the computer's other mental block was all about, but it seemed, not unnaturally, to have a mental block about it. He could no longer find any trace of it at all, in fact; it was that good. He wondered if he had been imagining it. He wondered if he had been imagining that it was something to do with something in the building, and something to do with the number 13. He ran a few tests. Yes, he had obviously been imagining it. 
No time for fancy routes now, there was obviously a major security alert in progress. Ford took the elevator up to the ground floor to change to the express elevators. He had somehow to get the Ident-i- Eeze back into Harl's pocket before it was missed. How, he didn't know. 
The doors of the elevator slid open to reveal a large posse of security guards and robots poised waiting for it and brandishing filthy looking weapons. 
They ordered him out. 
With a shrug he stepped forward. They all pushed rudely past him into the elevator which took them down to continue their search for him on the lower levels. 
This was fun, thought Ford, giving Colin a friendly pat. Colin was about the first genuinely useful robot Ford had ever encountered. Colin bobbed along in the air in front of him in a lather of cheerful ecstasy. Ford was glad he'd named him after a dog. 
He was highly tempted just to leave at that point and hope for the best, but he knew that the best had a far greater chance of actually occurring if Harl did not discover that his Ident-i-Eeze was missing. He had somehow, surreptitiously, to return it. 
They went to the express elevators. "Hi," said the elevator they got into. 
"Hi," said Ford.â¨"Where can I take you folks today?" said the elevator. "Floor 23," said Ford.â¨"Seems to be a popular floor today," said the elevator. 
"Hmm," thought Ford, not liking the sound of that at all. The elevator lit up the twenty-third floor on its floor display and started to zoom upwards. Something about the floor display tweaked at Ford's mind but he couldn't catch what it was and forgot about it. He was more worried about the idea of the floor he was going to being a popular one. He hadn't really thought through how he was going to deal with whatever it was that was happening up there because he had no idea what he was going to find. He would just have to busk it. 
They were there. The doors slid open. Ominous quiet. Empty corridor. 
There was the door to Harl's office, with a slight layer of dust around it. Ford knew that this dust consisted of billions of tiny molecular robots that had crawled out of the woodwork, built each other, rebuilt the door, disassembled each other and then crept back into the woodwork again and just waited for damage. Ford wondered what kind of life that was, but not for long because he was a lot more concerned about what his own life was like at that moment. 
He took a deep breath and started his run. 
Chapter 9 
Arthur felt at a bit of a loss. There was a whole Galaxy of stuff out there for him, and he wondered if it was churlish of him to complain to himself that it lacked just two things: the world he was born on and the woman he loved. 
Damn it and blast it, he thought, and felt the need of some guidance and advice. He consulted the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. He looked up "guidance" and it said "See under ADVICE". He looked up "advice" and it said "see under GUIDANCE". It had been doing a lot of that kind of stuff recently and he wondered if it was all it was cracked up to be. 
He headed to the outer Eastern Rim of the Galaxy where, it was said, wisdom and truth were to be found, most particularly on the planet Hawalius, which was a planet of oracles and seers and soothsayers and also take-away pizza shops, because most mystics were completely incapable of cooking for themselves. 
However it appeared that some sort of calamity had befallen this planet. As Arthur wandered the streets of the village where the major prophets lived, it had something of a crestfallen air. He came across one prophet who was clearly shutting up shop in a despondent kind of way and asked him what was happening. 
"No call for us any more," he said gruffly as he started to bang a nail into the plank he was holding across the window of his hovel. 
"Oh? Why's that?" 
"Hold on to the other end of this and I'll show you." 
Arthur held up the unnailed end of the plank and the old prophet scuttled into the recesses of his hovel, returning a moment or two later with a small Sub-Etha radio. He turned it on, fiddled with the dial for a moment and put the thing on the small wooden bench that he usually sat and prophesied on. He then took hold of the plank again and resumed hammering. 
Arthur sat and listened to the radio. 
"...be confirmed," said the radio. 
"Tomorrow," it continued, "the Vice-President of Poffla Vigus, Roopy Ga Stip, will announce that he intends to run for President. In a speech he will give tomorrow at..." 
"Find another channel," said the prophet. Arthur pushed the preset button. 
"...refused to Comment," said the radio. "Next week's jobless totals in the Zabush sector, it continued, "will be the worst since records began. A report published next month says..." 
"Find another," barked the prophet, crossly. Arthur pushed the button again. 
"...denied it categorically," said the radio. "Next month's Royal Wedding between Prince Gid of the Soofling Dynasty and Princess Hooli of Raui Alpha will be the most spectacular ceremony the Bjanjy Territories has ever witnessed. Our reporter Trillian Astra is there and sends us this report." 
Arthur blinked. 
The sound of cheering crowds and a hubbub of brass bands erupted from the radio. A very familiar voice said, "Well Krart, the scene here in the middle of next month is absolutely incredible. Princess Hooli is looking radiant in a..." 
The prophet swiped the radio off the bench and on to the dusty ground, where it squawked like a badly tuned chicken. 
"See what we have to contend with?" grumbled the prophet. "Here, hold this. Not that, this. No, not like that. This way up. Other way round, you fool." 
"I was listening to that," complained Arthur, grappling helplessly with the prophet's hammer. 
"So does everybody. That's why this place is like a ghost town." He spat into the dust. 
"No, I mean, that sounded like someone I knew." 
"Princess Hooli? If I had to stand around saying hello to everybody who's known Princess Hooli I'd need a new set of lungs." 
"Not the Princess," said Arthur. "The reporter. Her name's Trillian. I don't know where she got the Astra from. She's from the same planet as me. I wondered where she'd got to." 
"Oh, she's all over the continuum these days. We can't get the tri-d TV stations out here of course, thank the Great Green Arkleseizure, but you hear her on the radio, gallivanting here and there through space/time. She wants to settle down and find herself a steady era that young lady does. It'll all end in tears. Probably already has." He swung with his hammer and hit his thumb rather hard. He started to speak in tongues. 
The village of oracles wasn't much better. 
He had been told that when looking for a good oracle it was best to find the oracle that other oracles went to, but he was shut. There was a sign by the entrance saying, "I just don't know any more. Try next door (r), but that's just a suggestion, not formal oracular advice." 
"Next door" was a cave a few hundred yards away and Arthur walked towards it. Smoke and steam were rising from, respectively, a small fire and a battered tin pot that was hanging over it. There was also a very nasty smell coming from the pot. At least Arthur thought it was coming from the pot. The distended bladders of some of the local goat-like things were hanging from a propped-up line drying in the sun, and the smell could have been coming from them. There was also, a worryingly small distance away, a pile of discarded bodies of the local goat-like things and the smell could have been coming from them. 
But the smell could just as easily have been coming from the old lady who was busy beating flies away from the pile of bodies. It was a hopeless task because each of the flies was about the size of a winged bottle top and all she had was a table tennis bat. Also she seemed half blind. Every now and then, by chance, her wild thrashing would connect with one of the flies with a richly satisfying thunk, and the fly would hurtle through the air and smack itself open against the rock face a few yards from the entrance to her cave. 
She gave every impression, by her demeanour, that these were the moments she lived for. 
Arthur watched this exotic performance for a while from a polite distance, and then at last tried giving a gentle cough to attract her attention. The gentle cough, courteously meant, unfortunately involved first inhaling rather more of the local atmosphere than he had so far been doing and as a result, he erupted into a fit of raucous 
expectoration, and collapsed against the rock face, choking and streaming with tears. He struggled for breath, but each new breath made things worse. He vomited, half-choked again, rolled over his vomit, kept rolling for a few yards, and eventually made it up on to his hands and knees and crawled, panting, into slightly fresher air. 
"Excuse me," he said. He got some breath back. "I really am most dreadfully sorry. I feel a complete idiot and..." He gestured helplessly towards the small pile of his own vomit lying spread around the entrance to her cave. 
"What can I say?" he said. "What can I possibly say?" 
This at least had gained her attention. She looked round at him suspiciously, but, being half blind, had difficulty finding him in the blurred and rocky landscape. 
He waved, helpfully. "Hello!" he called. 
At last she spotted him, grunted to herself and turned back to whacking flies. 
It was horribly apparent from the way that currents of air moved when she did, that the major source of the smell was in fact her. The drying bladders, the festering bodies and the noxious potage may all have been making violent contributions to the atmosphere, but the major olfactory presence was the woman herself. 
She got another good thwack at a fly. It smacked against the rock and dribbled its insides down it in what she clearly regarded, if she could see that far, as a satisfactory manner. 
Unsteadily, Arthur got to his feet and brushed himself down with a fistful of dried grass. He didn't know what else to do by way of announcing himself. He had half a mind just to wander off again, but felt awkward about leaving a pile of his vomit in front of the entrance to the woman's home. He wondered what to do about it. He started to pluck up more handsful of the scrubby dried grass that was to be found here and there. He was worried, though, that if he ventured nearer to the vomit he might simply add to it rather than clear it up. 
Just as he was debating with himself as to what the right course of action was he began to realise that she was at last saying something to him. 
"I beg your pardon?" he called out. 
"I said, can I help you?" she said, in a thin, scratchy voice. that he could only just hear. 
"Er, I came to ask your advice," he called back, feeling a bit ridiculous. 
She turned to peer at him, myopically, then turned back, swiped at a fly and missed. 
"What about?" she said. 
"I beg your pardon?" he said. 
"I said, what about?" she almost screeched. 
"Well," said Arthur. "Just sort of general advice, really. It said in the brochure " 
"Ha! Brochure!" spat the old woman. She seemed to be waving her bat more or less at random now. 
Arthur fished the crumpled-up brochure from his pocket. He wasn't quite certain why. He had already read it and she, he expected, wouldn't want to. He unfolded it anyway in order to have something to frown thoughtfully at for a moment or two. The copy in the brochure wittered on about the ancient mystical arts of the seers and sages of Hawalius, and wildly over-represented the level of accommodation available in Hawalion. Arthur still carried a copy of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy with him but found, when he consulted it, that the entries were becoming more abstruse and paranoid and had lots of x's and j's and 's in them. Something was wrong somewhere. Whether it was in his own personal unit, or whether it was something or someone going terribly amiss, orâ¨perhaps just hallucinating, at the heart of the Guide organisation itself, he didn't know. But one way or another he was even less inclined to trust it than usual, which meant that he trusted it not one bit, and mostly used it for eating his sandwiches off when he was sitting on a rock staring at something. 
The woman had turned and was walking slowly towards him now. Arthur tried, without making it too obvious, to judge the wind direction, and bobbed about a bit as she approached. 
"Advice," she said. "Advice, eh?" 
"Er, yes," said Arthur. "Yes, that is " 
He frowned again at the brochure, as if to be certain that he hadn't misread it and stupidly turned up on the wrong planet or something. 
The brochure said "The friendly local inhabitants will be glad to share with you the knowledge and wisdom of the ancients. Peer with them into the swirling mysteries of past and future time!" There were some coupons as well, but Arthur had been far too embarrassed actually to cut them out or try to present them to anybody. 
"Advice, eh," said the old woman again. "Just sort of general advice, you say. On what? What to do with your life, that sort of thing?" 
"Yes," said Arthur. "That sort of thing. Bit of a problem I sometimes find if I'm being perfectly honest." He was trying desperately, with tiny darting movements, to stay upwind of her. She surprised him by suddenly turning sharply away from him and heading off towards her cave. 
"You'll have to help me with the photocopier, then," she said. 
"What?" said Arthur. 
"The photocopier," she repeated, patiently. "You'll have to help me drag it out. It's solar-powered. I have to keep it in the cave, though, so the birds don't shit on it." 
"I see," said Arthur. 
"I'd take a few deep breaths if I were you," muttered the old woman, as she stomped into the gloom of the cave mouth. 
Arthur did as she advised. He almost hyperventilated in fact. When he felt he was ready, he held his breath and followed her in. 
The photocopier was a big old thing on a rickety trolley. It stood just inside the dim shadows of the cave. The wheels were stuck obstinately in different directions and the ground was rough and stony. 
"Go ahead and take a breath outside," said the old woman. Arthur was going red in the face trying to help her move the thing. 
He nodded in relief. If she wasn't going to be embarrassed about it then neither, he was determined, would he. He stepped outside and took a few breaths, then came back in to do more heaving and pushing. He had to do this quite a few times till at last the machine was outside. 
The sun beat down on it. The old woman disappeared back into her cave again and brought with her some mottled metal panels, which she connected to the machine to collect the sun's energy. 
She squinted up into the sky. The sun was quite bright, but the day was hazy and vague. 
"It'll take a while," she said. 
Arthur said he was happy to wait. 
The old woman shrugged and stomped across to the fire. Above it, the contents of the tin can were bubbling away. She poked about at them with a stick. 
"You won't be wanting any lunch?" she enquired of Arthur. 
"I've eaten, thanks," said Arthur. "No, really. I've eaten." 
"I'm sure you have," said the old lady. She stirred with the stick. After a few minutes she fished a lump of something out, blew on it to cool it a little, and then put it in her mouth. 
She chewed on it thoughtfully for a bit. 
Then she hobbled slowly across to the pile of dead goat-like things. She spat the lump out on to the pile. She hobbled slowly back to the can. She tried to unhook it from the sort of tripod-like thing that it was hanging from. 
"Can I help you?" said Arthur, jumping up politely. He hurried over. 
Together they disengaged the tin from the tripod and carried it awkwardly down the slight slope that led downwards from her cave and towards a line of scrubby and gnarled trees, which marked the edge of a steep but quite shallow gully, from, which a whole new range of offensive smells was emanating. 
"Ready?" said the old Lady. 
"Yes..." said Arthur, though he didn't know for what. 
"One," said the old lady. 
"Two," she said. 
"Three," she added. 
Arthur realised just in time what she intended. Together they tossed the contents of the tin into the gully. 
After an hour or two of uncommunicative silence, the old woman decided that the solar panels had absorbed enough sunlight to run the photocopier now and she disappeared to rummage inside her cave. She emerged at last with a few sheaves of paper and fed them through the machine. 
She handed the copies to Arthur. 
"This is, er, this your advice then, is it?" said Arthur, leafing through them uncertainly. 
"No," said the old lady. "It's the story of my life. You see, the quality of any advice anybody has to offer has to be judged against the quality of life they actually lead. Now, as you look through this document you'll see that I've underlined all the major decisions I ever made to make them stand out. They're all indexed and cross- referenced. See? All I can suggest is that if you take decisions that are exactly opposite to the sort of decisions that I've taken, then maybe you won't finish up at the end of your life..." she paused, and filled her lungs for a good shout, "... in a smelly old cave like this!" 
She grabbed up her table tennis bat, rolled up her sleeve, stomped off to her pile of dead goat-like things, and started to set about the flies with vim and vigour. 
The last village Arthur visited consisted entirely of extremely high poles. They were so high that it wasn't possible to tell, from the ground, what was on top of them, and Arthur had to climb three before he found one that had anything on top of it at all other than a platform covered with bird droppings. 
Not an easy task. You went up the poles by climbing on the short wooden pegs that had been hammered into them in slowly ascending spirals. Anybody who was a less diligent tourist than Arthur would have taken a couple of snapshots and sloped right off to the nearest Bar & Grill, where you also could buy a range of particularly sweet and gooey chocolate cakes to eat in front of the ascetics. But, largely as a result of this, most of the ascetics had gone now. In fact they had mostly gone and set up lucrative therapy centres on some of the more affluent worlds in the North West ripple of the Galaxy, where the living was easier by a factor of about seventeen million, and the chocolate was just fabulous. Most of the ascetics, it turned out, had not known about chocolate before they took up asceticism. Most of the clients who came to their therapy centres knew about it all too well. 
At the top of the third pole Arthur stopped for a breather. He was very hot and out of breath, since each pole was about fifty or sixty feet high. The world seemed to swing vertiginously around him, but it didn't worry Arthur too much. He knew that, logically, he could not 
die until he had been to Stavromula Beta6, and had therefore managed to cultivate a merry attitude towards extreme personal danger. He felt a little giddy perched fifty feet up in the air on top of a pole, but he dealt with it by eating a sandwich. He was just about to embark on reading the photocopied life history of the oracle, when he was rather startled to hear a slight cough behind him. 
He turned so abruptly that he dropped his sandwich, which turned downwards through the air and was rather small by the time it was stopped by the ground. 
About thirty feet behind Arthur was another pole, and, alone amongst the sparse forest of about three dozen poles, the top of it was occupied. It was occupied by an old man who, in turn, seemed to be occupied by profound thoughts that were making him scowl. 
"Excuse me," said Arthur. The man ignored him. Perhaps he couldn't hear him. The breeze was moving about a bit. It was only by chance that Arthur had heard the slight cough. 
"Hello?" called Arthur. "Hello!" 
The man at last glanced round at him. He seemed surprised to see him. Arthur couldn't tell if he was surprised and pleased to see him or just surprsised. 
"Are you open?" called Arthur. 
The man frowned in incomprehension. Arthur couldn't tell if he couldn't understand or couldn't hear. 
"I'll pop over," called Arthur. "Don't go away." 
He clambered off the small platform and climbed quickly down the spiralling pegs, arriving at the bottom quite dizzy. 
He started to make his way over to the pole on which the old man was sitting, and then suddenly realised that he had disorientedâ¨himself on the way down and didn't know for certain which one it was. 
He looked around for landmarks and worked out which was the right one. 
He climbed it. It wasn't. 
"Damn," he said. "Excuse me!" he called out to the old man again, who was now straight in front of him and forty feet away. "Got lost. Be with you in a minute." Down he went again, getting very hot and bothered. 
When he arrived, panting and sweating, at the top of the pole that he knew for certain was the right one he realised that the man was, somehow or other, mucking him about. 
"What do you want?" shouted the old man crossly at him. He was now sitting on top of the pole that Arthur recognised was the one that he had been on himself when eating his sandwich. 
"How did you get over there?" called Arthur in bewilderment. 
"You think I'm going to tell you just like that what it took me forty springs, summers and autumns of sitting on top of a pole to work out?" 
"What about winter?"â¨"What about winter?"â¨"Don't you sit on the pole in the winter?" 
"Just because I sit up a pole for most of my life," said the man, "doesn't mean I'm an idiot. I go south in the winter. Got a beach house. Sit on the chimney stack." 
"Do you have any advice for a traveller?" "Yes. Get a beach house."â¨"I see." 
The man stared out over the hot, dry scrubby landscape. From here Arthur could just see the old woman, a tiny speck in the distance, dancing up and down swatting flies. 
"You see her?" called the old man, suddenly. 
"Yes," said Arthur. "I consulted her in fact." 
"Fat lot she knows. I got the beach house because she turned it down. What advice did she give you?" 
"Do exactly the opposite of everything she's done." 
"In other words, get a beach house." 
"I suppose so," said Arthur. "Well, maybe I'll get one." 
"Hmmm." 
The horizon was swimming in a fetid heat haze. 
"Any other advice?" asked Arthur. "Other than to do with real estate?" 
"A beach house isn't just real estate. It's a state of mind," said the man. He turned and looked at Arthur. 
Oddly, the man's face was now only a couple of feet away. He seemed in one way to be a perfectly normal shape, but his body was sitting cross-legged on a pole forty feet away while his face was only two feet from Arthur's. Without moving his head, and without seeming to do anything odd at all, he stood up and stepped on to the top of another pole. Either it was just the heat, thought Arthur, or space was a different shape for him. 
"A beach house," he said, "doesn't even have to be on the beach. Though the best ones are. We all like to congregate," he went on, "at boundary conditions." 
"Really?" said Arthur. 
"Where land meets water. Where earth meets air. Where body meets mind. Where space meets time. We like to be on one side, and look at the other." 
Arthur got terribly excited. This was exactly the sort of thing he'd been promised in the brochure. Here was a man who seemed to be moving through some kind of Escher space saying really profound things about all sorts of stuff. 
It was unnerving though. The man was now stepping from pole to ground, from ground to pole, from pole to pole, from pole to horizon and back: he was making complete nonsense of Arthur's spatial universe. "Please stop!" Arthur said, suddenly. 
"Can't take it, huh?" said the man. Without the slightest movement he was now back, sitting cross-legged, on top of the pole forty feet in front of Arthur. "You come to me for advice, but you can't cope with anything you don't recognise. Hmmm. So we'll have to tell you something you already know but make it sound like news, eh? Well, business as usual I suppose." He sighed and squinted mournfully into the distance. 
"Where you from, boy?" he then asked. Arthur decided to be clever. He was fed up with being mistaken for a complete idiot by everyone he ever met. "Tell you what," he said. "You're a seer. Why don't you tell me?" 
The old man sighed again. "I was just," he said, passing his hand round behind his head, "making conversation." When he brought his hand round to the front again, he had a globe of the Earth spinning on his up-pointed forefinger. It was unmistakable. He put it away again. Arthur was stunned. 
"How did you " 
"I can't tell you." 
"Why not? I've come all this way." "You cannot see what I see because you see what you see. You cannot know what I know because you know what you know. What I see and what I know cannot be added to what you see and what you know because they are not of the same kind. Neither can it replace what you see and what you know, because that would be to replace you yourself." 
"Hang on, can I write this down?" said Arthur, excitedly fumbling in his pocket for a pencil. 
"You can pick up a copy at the spaceport," said the old man. "They've got racks of the stuff." 
"Oh," said Arthur, disappointed. "Well, isn't there anything that's perhaps a bit more specific to me?" 
"Everything you see or hear or experience in any way at all is specific to you. You create a universe by perceiving it, so everything in the universe you perceive is specific to you." 
Arthur looked at him doubtfully. "Can I get that at the spaceport, too?" he said. 
"Check it out," said the old man. 
"It says in the brochure," said Arthur, pulling it out of his pocket and looking at it again, "that I can have a special prayer, individually tailored to me and my special needs." 
"Oh, all right," said the old man. "Here's a prayer for you. Got a pencil?" 
"Yes," said Arthur. 
"It goes like this. Let's see now: "'Protect me from knowing what I don't need to know. Protect me from even knowing that there are things to know that I don't know. Protect me from knowing that I decided not to know about the things that I decided not to know about. Amen.'" That's it. It's what you pray silently inside yourself anyway, so you may as well have it out in the open." 
"Hmmm," said Arthur. "Well, thank you " 
"There's another prayer that goes with it that's very important," continued the old man, "so you'd better jot this down, too." 
"OK." 
"It goes, "'Lord, lord, lord...'" It's best to put that bit in, just in case. You can never be too sure "'Lord, lord, lord. Protect me from the consequences of the above prayer. Amen...'" And that's it. Most of the trouble people get into in life comes from missing out that last part." 
"Ever heard of a place called Stavromula Beta?" asked Arthur. "No."â¨"Well, thank you for your help," said Arthur.â¨"Don't mention it," said the man on the pole, and vanished. 
Chapter 10 
Ford hurled himself at the door of the editor-in-chief's office, tucked himself into a tight ball as the frame splintered and gave way once again, rolled rapidly across the floor to where the smart grey crushed leather sofa was and set up his strategic operational base behind it. 
That, at least, was the plan. 
Unfortunately the smart grey crushed leather sofa wasn't there. 
Why, thought Ford, as he twisted himself round in mid-air, lurched, dived and scuttled for cover behind Harl's desk, did people have this stupid obsession with rearranging their office furniture every five minutes? 
Why, for instance, replace a perfectly serviceable if rather muted grey crushed leather sofa with what appeared to be a small tank? 
And who was the big guy with the mobile rocket launcher on his shoulder? Someone from head office? Couldn't be. This was head office. At least it was the head office of the Guide. Where these InfiniDim Enterprises guys came from Zarquon knew. Nowhere very sunny, judging from the slug-like colour and texture of their skins. This was all wrong, thought Ford. People connected with the Guide should come from sunny places. 
There were several of them, in fact, and all of them seemed to be more heavily armed and armoured than you normally expected corporate executives to be, even in today's rough and tumble business world. 
He was making a lot of assumptions here, of course. He was assuming that the big, bull-necked, slug-like guys were in some way connected with InfiniDim Enterprises, but it was a reasonable assumption and he felt happy about it because they had logos on their armour-plating which said "InfiniDim Enterprises" on them. He had a nagging suspicion that this was not a business meeting, though. 
He also had a nagging feeling that these slug-like creatures were familiar to him in some way. Familiar, but in an unfamiliar guise. 
Well, he had been in the room for a good two and a half seconds now, and thought that it was probably about time to start doing something constructive. He could take a hostage. That would be good. 
Vann Harl was in his swivel chair, looking alarmed, pale and shaken. Had probably had some bad news as well as a nasty bang to the back of his head. Ford leapt to his feet and made a running grab for him. 
Under the pretext of getting him into a good solid double underpinned elbow-lock, Ford managed surreptitiously to slip the Ident-i-Eeze back into Harl's inner pocket. 
Bingo! 
He'd done what he came to do. Now he just had to talk his way out of here. 
"OK," he said. "I..." He paused. 
The big guy with the rocket launcher was turning towards Ford Prefect and pointing it at him, which Ford couldn't help feeling was wildly irresponsible behaviour. 
"I..." he started again, and then on a sudden impulse decided to duck. 
There was a deafening roar as flames leapt from the back of the rocket launcher and a rocket leapt from its front. 
The rocket hurtled past Ford and hit the large plate-glass window, which billowed outwards in a shower of a million shards under the force of the explosion. Huge shock waves of noise and air pressure reverberated around the room, sweeping a couple of chairs, a filing cabinet and Colin the security robot out of the window. 
Ah! So they're not totally rocket-proof after all, thought Ford Prefect to himself. Someone should have a word with somebody about that. He disentangled himself from Harl and tried to work out which way to run. 
He was surrounded. 
The big guy with the rocket launcher was moving it up into position for another shot. Ford was completely at a loss for what to do next. 
"Look," he said in a stern voice. But he wasn't certain how far saying things like "Look" in a stern voice was necessarily going to get him, and time was not on his side. What the hell, he thought, you're 
only young once, and threw himself out of the window. That would at least keep the element of surprise on his side. 
Chapter 11 
The first thing Arthur Dent had to do, he realised resignedly, was to get himself a life. This meant he had to find a planet he could have one on. It had to be a planet he could breathe on, where he could stand up and sit down without experiencing gravitational discomfort. It had to be somewhere where the acid levels were low and the plants didn't actually attack you. 
"I hate to be anthropic about this," he said to the strange thing behind the desk at the Resettlement Advice Centre on Pintleton Alpha, "but I'd quite like to live somewhere where the people look vaguely like me as well. You know. Sort of human." 
The strange thing behind the desk waved some of its stranger bits around and seemed rather taken aback by this. It oozed and glopped off its seat, thrashed its way slowly across the floor, ingested the old metal filing cabinet and then, with a great belch, excreted the appropriate drawer. It popped out a couple of glistening tentacles from its ear, removed some files from the drawer, sucked the drawer back in and vomited up the cabinet again. It thrashed its way back across the floor, slimed its way back up on to the seat and slapped the files on the table. 
"See anything you fancy?" it asked. 
Arthur looked nervously through some grubby and damp pieces of paper. He was definitely in some backwater part of the Galaxy here, and somewhere off to the left as far as the universe he knew and recognised was concerned. In the space where his own home should have been there was a rotten hick planet, drowned with rain and inhabited by thugs and boghogs. Even The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy seemed to work only fitfully here, which was why he was reduced to making these sorts of enquiries in these sorts of places. One place he always asked after was Stavromula Beta, but no one had ever heard of such a planet. 
The available worlds looked pretty grim. They had little to offer him because he had little to offer them. He had been extremely chastened to realise that although he originally came from a world which had cars and computers and ballet and armagnac he didn't, by himself, know how any of it worked. He couldn't do it. Left to his own devices he couldn't build a toaster. He could just about make a sandwich and that was it. There was not a lot of demand for his services. 
Arthur's heart sank. This surprised him, because he thought it was already about as low as it could possibly be. He closed his eyes for a moment. He so much wanted to be home. He so much wanted his own home world, the actual Earth he had grown up on, not to have been demolished. He so much wanted none of this to have happened. He so much wanted that when he opened his eyes again he would be standing on the doorstep of his little cottage in the west country of England, that the sun would be shining over the green hills, the post van would be going up the lane, the daffodils would be blooming in his garden, and in the distance the pub would be opening for lunch. He so much wanted to take the newspaper down to the pub and read it over a pint of bitter. He so much wanted to do the crossword. He so much wanted to be able to get completely stuck on 17 across. 
He opened his eyes. 
The strange thing was pulsating irritably at him, tapping some kind of pseudopodia on the desk. 
Arthur shook his head and looked at the next sheet of paper. Grim, he thought. And the next.â¨Very grim. And the next.â¨Oh... Now that looked better. 
It was a world called Bartledan. It had oxygen. It had green hills. It even, it seemed, had a renowned literary culture. But the thing that most aroused his interest was a photograph of a small bunch of Bartledanian people, standing around in a village square, smiling pleasantly at the camera. 
"Ah," he said, and held the picture up to the strange thing behind the desk. 
Its eyes squirmed out on stalks and roiled up and down the piece of paper, leaving a glistening trail of slime all over it. 
"Yes," it said with distaste. "They do look exactly like you." 
Arthur moved to Bartledan and, using some money he had made by selling some toenail clippings and spit to a DNA bank, he bought himself a room in the village featured in the picture. It was pleasant there. The air was balmy. The people looked like him and seemed not to mind him being there. They didn't attack him with anything. He bought some clothes and a cupboard to put them in. 
He had got himself a life. Now he had to find a purpose in it. 
At first he tried to sit and read. But the literature of Bartledan, famed though it was throughout this sector of the Galaxy for its subtlety and grace, didn't seem to be able to sustain his interest. The problem was that it wasn't actually about human beings after all. It wasn't about what human beings wanted. The people of Bartledan were remarkably like human beings to look at, but when you said "Good evening" to one, he would tend to look around with a slight sense of surprise, sniff the air and say that, yes, he supposed that it probably was a goodish evening now that Arthur came to mention it. 
"No, what I meant was to wish you a good evening," Arthur would say, or rather, used to say. He soon learned to avoid these conversations. "I mean that I hope you have a good evening," he would add. 
More puzzlement. 
"Wish?" the Bartledanian would say at last, in polite bafflement. 
"Er, yes," Arthur would then have said. "I'm just expressing the hope that..." 
"Hope?" 
"Yes." 
"What is hope?" 
Good question, thought Arthur to himself, and retreated back to his room to think about things. 
On the one hand he could only recognise and respect what he learnt about the Bartledanian view of the universe, which was that the universe was what the universe was, take it or leave it. On the other hand he could not help but feel that not to desire anything, not ever to. wish or to hope, was just not natural. 
Natural. There was a tricky word. 
He had long ago realised that a lot of things that he had thought of as natural, like buying people presents at Christmas, stopping at red lights or falling at a rate of 32 feet/second/second, were just the habits of his own world and didn't necessarily work the same way anywhere else; but not to wish that really couldn't be natural, could it? That would be like not breathing. 
Breathing was another thing that the Bartledanians didn't do, despite all the oxygen in the atmosphere. They just stood there. Occasionally they ran around and played netball and stuff (without ever wishing to win though, of course they would just play, and whoever won, won), but they never actually breathed. It was, for some reason, unnecessary. Arthur quickly learned that playing netball with them was just too spooky. Though they looked like humans, and even moved and sounded like humans, they didn't breathe and they didn't wish for things. 
Breathing and wishing for things, on the other hand, was just about all that Arthur seemed to do all day. Sometimes he would wish for things so much that his breathing would get quite agitated, and he would have to go and lie down for a bit. On his own. In his small room. So far from the world which had given birth to him that his brain 
could not even process the sort of numbers involved without just going limp. 
He preferred not to think about it. He preferred just to sit and read or at least he would prefer it if there was anything worth reading. But nobody in Bartledanian stories ever wanted anything. Not even a glass of water. Certainly, they would fetch one if they were thirsty, but if there wasn't one available, they would think no more about it. He had just read an entire book in which the main character had, over the course of a week, done some work in his garden, played a great deal of netball, helped mend a road, fathered a child on his wife and then unexpectedly died of thirst just before the last chapter. In exasperation Arthur had combed his way back through the book and in the end had found a passing reference to some problem with the plumbing in Chapter 2. And that was it. So the guy dies. It just happens. 
It wasn't even the climax of the book, because there wasn't one. The character died about a third of the way through the penultimate chapter of the book, and the rest of it was just more stuff about road- 
mending. The book just finished dead at the one hundred thousandth word, because that was how long books were on Bartledan. 
Arthur threw the book across the room, sold the room and left. He started to travel with wild abandon, trading in more and more spit, toenails, fingernails, blood, hair, anything that anybody wanted, for tickets. For semen, he discovered, he could travel first class. He settled nowhere, but only existed in the hermetic, twilight world of the cabins of hyperspatial starships, eating, drinking, sleeping, watching movies, only stopping at spaceports to donate more DNA and catch the next long-haul ship out. He waited and waited for another accident to happen. 
The trouble with trying to make the right accident happen is that it won't. That is not what "accident" means. The accident that eventually occurred was not what he had planned at all. The ship he was on blipped in hyperspace, flickered horribly between ninety- seven different points in the Galaxy simultaneously, caught the unexpected gravitational pull of an uncharted planet in one of them, became ensnared in its outer atmosphere and began to fall, screaming and tearing, into it. 
The ship's systems protested all the way down that everything was perfectly normal and under control, but when it went into a final hectic spin, ripped wildly through half a mile of trees and finally exploded into a seething ball of flame it became clear that this was not the case. 
Fire engulfed the forest, boiled into the night, then neatly put itself out, as all unscheduled fires over a certain size are now required to do by law. For a short while afterwards, other small fires flared up here and there as odd pieces of scattered debris exploded quietly in their own time. Then they too died away. 
Arthur Dent, because of the sheer boredom of endless inter-stellar flight, was the only one on board who had actually familiarised himself with the ship's safety procedures in case of an unscheduled landing, and was therefore the sole survivor. He lay dazed, broken and bleeding in a sort of fluffy pink plastic cocoon with "Have a nice day" printed in over three thousand different languages all over it. 
Black, roaring silences swam sickeningly through his shatteredâ¨mind. He knew with a kind of resigned certainty that he would survive, because he had not yet been to Stavromula Beta. 
After what seemed an eternity of pain and darkness, he became aware of quiet shapes moving around him. 
Chapter 12 
Ford tumbled through the open air in a cloud of glass splinters and chair parts. Again, he hadn't really thought things through, really, and was just playing it by ear, buying time. At times of major crisis he found it was often quite helpful to have his life flash before his eyes. It gave him a chance to reflect on things, see things in some sort of perspective, and it sometimes furnished him with a vital clue as to what to do next. 
There was the ground rushing up to meet him at 30 feet per second per second, but he would, he thought, deal with that problem when he got to it. First things first. 
Ah, here it came. His childhood. Hum drum stuff, he'd been through it all before. Images flashed by. Boring times on Betelgeuse Five. Zaphod Beeblebrox as a kid. Yes he knew all that. He wished he had some kind of fast forward in his brain. His seventh birthday party, being given his first towel. Come on, come on. 
He was twisting and turning downwards, the outside air at this height a cold shock to his lungs. Trying not to inhale glass. 
Early voyages to other planets. Oh for Zark's sake, this was like some sort of bloody travelogue documentary before the main feature. First beginning to work for the Guide. 
Ah! 
Those were the days. They worked out of a hut on the Bwenelli Atoll on Fanalla before the Riktanarqals and the Danqueds vertled it. Half a dozen guys, some towels, a handful of highly sophisticated digital devices, and most importantly a lot of dreams. No. Most importantly a lot of Fanallan rum. To be completely accurate, that Ol" Janx Spirit was the absolute most important thing, then the Fanallan rum, and also some of the beaches on the Atoll where the local girls would hang out, but the dreams were important as well. Whatever happened to those? 
He couldn't quite remember what the dreams were in fact, but they had seemed immensely important at the time. They had certainly not involved this huge towering office block he was now falling down the side of. All of that had come when some of the original team had started to settle down and get greedy, while he and others had stayed out in the field, researching and hitch hiking, and gradually becoming more and more isolated from the corporate nightmare the Guide had inexorably turned into, and the architectural monstrosity it had come to occupy. Where were the dreams in that? He thought of all the corporate lawyers who occupied half of the building, all the "operatives" who occupied the lower levels, and all the sub-editors and their secretaries and their secretaries lawyers and their secretaries lawyers secretaries, and worst of all the accountants and the marketing department. 
He had half a mind just to keep on falling. Two fingers to the lot of them. 
He was just passing the seventeenth floor now, where the marketing department hung out. Load of tosspots all arguing about what colour the Guide should be and exercising their infinitely infallible skills of being wise after the event. If any of them had chosen to look out of the window at that moment they would have been startled by the sight of Ford Prefect dropping past them to his certain death and flicking V-signs at them. 
Sixteenth floor. Sub-editors. Bastards. What about all that copy of his they'd cut? Fifteen years of research he'd filed from one planet alone and they'd cut it to two words. "Mostly Harmless." V-signs to them as well. 
Fifteenth floor. Logistical Administration, whatever that was about. They all had big cars. That, he thought, was what that was about. 
Fourteenth floor. Personnel. He had a very shrewd suspicion that it was they who had engineered his fifteen-year exile while the Guide metamorphosed into the corporate monolith (or rather, duolith mustn't forget the lawyers) it had become. 
Thirteenth floor. Research and development. Hang about.â¨Thirteenth floor. 
He was having to think rather fast at the moment because the situation was becoming a little urgent. 
He suddenly remembered the floor display panel in the elevator. It hadn't had a thirteenth floor. He'd thought no more about it because, having spent fifteen years on the rather backward planet Earth where they were superstitious about the number thirteen, he was used to being in buildings that numbered their floors without it. No reason for that here, though. 
The windows of the thirteenth floor, he could not help noticing as he flashed swiftly by them, were darkened. 
What was going on in there? He started to remember all the stuff that Harl had been talking about. One, new, multi-dimensional Guide spread across an infinite number of universes. It had sounded, the way Harl had put it, like wild meaninglessness dreamed up by the marketing department with the backing of the accountants. If it was any more real than that then it was a very weird and dangerous idea. Was it real? What was going on behind the darkened windows of the sealed-off thirteenth floor? 
Ford felt a rising sense of curiosity, and then a rising sense of panic. That was the complete list of rising feelings he had. In every other respect he was falling very rapidly. He really ought to turn his mind to wondering how he was going to get out of this situation alive. 
He glanced down. A hundred feet or so below him people were milling around, some of them beginning to look up expectantly. Clearing a space for him. Even temporarily calling off the wonderful and completely fatuous hunt for wockets. 
He would hate to disappoint them, but about two feet below him, he hadn't realised before, was Colin. Colin had obviously been happily dancing attendance and waiting for him to decide what he wanted to do. 
"Colin!" Ford bawled. 
Colin didn't respond. Ford went cold. Then he suddenly realised that he hadn't told Colin his name was Colin. 
"Come up here!" Ford bawled. 
Colin bobbed up beside him. Colin was enjoying the ride down immensely and hoped that Ford was, too. 
Colin's world went unexpectedly dark as Ford's towel suddenly enveloped him. Colin immediately felt himself get much, much heavier. He was thrilled and delighted by the challenge that Ford had presented him with. Just not sure if he could handle it, that was all. 
The towel was slung over Colin. Ford was hanging from the towel, gripping to its seams. Other hitchhikers had seen fit to modify their towels in exotic ways, weaving all kinds of esoteric tools and utilities and even computer equipment into their fabric. Ford was a purist. He liked to keep things simple. He carried a regular towel from a regular domestic soft furnishings shop. It even had a kind of blue and pink floral pattern despite his repeated attempts to bleach and stone wash it. It had a couple of pieces of wire threaded into it, a bit of flexible writing stick, and also some nutrients soaked into one of the corners of the fabric so he could suck it in an emergency, but otherwise it was a simple towel you could dry your face on. 
The only actual modification he had been persuaded by a friend to make to it was to reinforce the seams. 
Ford gripped the seams like a maniac. 
They were still descending, but the rate had slowed. 
"Up, Colin!" he shouted. 
Nothing. 
"Your name," shouted Ford, "is Colin. So when I shout "'Up, Colin!'" I want you, Colin, to go up. OK? Up, Colin!" 
Nothing. Or rather a sort of muffled groaning sound from Colin. Ford was very anxious. They were descending very slowly now, but Ford was very anxious about the sort of people he could see assembling on the ground beneath him. Friendly, local, wocket- hunting types were dispersing, and thick, heavy, bull-necked, slug-like creatures with rocket launchers were, it seemed, sliding out of what was usually called thin air. Thin air, as all experienced Galactic travellers well know, is, in fact, extremely thick with multi- dimensional complexities. 
"Up," bellowed Ford again. "Up! Colin, go up!" 
Colin was straining and groaning. They were now more or less stationary in the air. Ford felt as if his fingers were breaking. 
"Up!"â¨They stayed put. 
"Up, up, up!" 
A slug was preparing to launch a rocket at him. Ford couldn't believe it. He was hanging from a towel in mid-air and a slug was preparing to fire rockets at him. He was running out of anything he could think of doing and was beginning to get seriously alarmed. 
This was the sort of predicament that he usually relied on having the Guide available for to give advice, however infuriating or glib, but this was not a moment for reaching into his pocket. And the Guide seemed to be no longer a friend and ally but was now itself a sourceâ¨of danger. These were the Guide offices he was hanging outside, for Zark's sake, in danger of his life from the people who now appearedâ¨to own the thing. What had become of all the dreams he vaguely remembered having on the Bwenelli Atoll? They should have let it all be. They should have stayed there. Stayed on the beach. Loved good women. Lived on fish. He should have known it was all wrong the moment they started hanging grand pianos over the sea-monsterâ¨pool in the atrium. He began to feel thoroughly wasted and miserable. His fingers were on fire with clenched pain. And his ankle was still hurting. 
Oh thank you, ankle, he thought to himself bitterly. Thank you for bringing up your problems at this time. I expect you'd like a nice warm footbath to make you feel better, wouldn't you? Or at least you'd like me to... 
He had an idea. 
The armoured slug had hoisted the rocket launcher up on to its shoulder. The rocket was presumably designed to hit anything in its path that moved. 
Ford tried not to sweat because he could feel his grip on the seams of his towel slipping. 
With the toe of his good foot he nudged and prised at the heel of the shoe on his hurting foot. 
"Go up, damn you!" Ford muttered hopelessly to Colin, who was cheerily straining away but unable to rise. Ford worked away at the heel of his shoe. 
He was trying to judge the timing, but there was no point. Just go for it. He only had one shot and that was it. He had now eased the 
back of his shoe down off his heel. His twisted ankle felt a little better. Well that was good, wasn't it? 
With his other foot he kicked at the heel of the shoe. It slipped off his foot and fell through the air. About half a second later a rocket erupted up from the muzzle of its launcher, encountered the shoe falling through its path, went straight for it, hit it, and exploded with a great sense of satisfaction and achievement. 
This happened about fifteen feet from the ground. 
The main force of the explosion was directed downwards. Where, a second earlier, there had been a squad of InfiniDim Enterprises executives with a rocket launcher standing on an elegant terraced plaza paved with large slabs of lustrous stone cut from the ancient alabastrum quarries of Zentalquabula there was now, instead, a bit of a pit with nasty bits in it. 
A great wump of hot air welled up from the explosion throwing Ford and Colin violently up into the sky. Ford fought desperately and blindly to hold on and failed. He turned helplessly upwards through the sky, reached the peak of a parabola, paused and then started to fall again. He fell and fell and fell and suddenly winded himself badly on Colin, who was still rising. 
He clasped himself desperately on to the small spherical robot. Colin slewed wildly through the air towards the tower of the Guide offices, trying delightedly to control himself and slow down. 
The world span sickeningly round Ford's head as they span and twisted round each other and then, equally sickeningly, everything suddenly stopped. 
Ford found himself deposited dizzily on a window ledge. His towel fell past and he grabbed at it and caught it. Colin bobbed in the air inches away from him. 
Ford looked around himself in a bruised, bleeding and breath-less daze. The ledge was only about a foot wide and he was perched precariously on it, thirteen stories up. 
Thirteen. 
He knew they were thirteen stories up because the windows were dark. He was bitterly upset. He had bought those shoes for some absurd price in a store on the Lower East Side in New York. He had, as a result, written an entire essay on the joys of great footwear, all of 
which had been jettisoned in the "Mostly harmless" debacle. Damn everything. 
And now one of the shoes was gone. He threw his head back and stared at the sky. 
It wouldn't be such a grim tragedy if the planet in question hadn't been demolished, which meant that he wouldn't even be able to get another pair. 
Yes, given the infinite sideways extension of probability there was, of course, an almost infinite multiplicity of planets Earth, but, when you came down to it, a major pair of shoes wasn't something you could just replace by mucking about in multi-dimensional space/time. 
He sighed. 
Oh well, he'd better make the best of it. At least it had saved his life. For the time being. 
He was perched on a foot-wide ledge thirteen stories up the side of a building and he wasn't at all sure that that was worth a good shoe. 
He stared in woozily through the darkened glass. 
It was as dark and silent as the tomb. 
No. That was a ridiculous thing to think. He'd been to some great parties in tombs. 
Could he detect some movement? He wasn't quite sure. It seemed that he could see some kind of weird, flapping shadow. Perhaps it was just blood dribbling over his eyelashes. He wiped it away. Boy, he'd love to have a farm somewhere, keep some sheep. He peered intoâ¨the window again, trying to make out what the shape was, but he had the feeling, so common in today's universe, that he was looking into some kind of optical illusion and that his eyes were just playing silly buggers with him. 
Was there a bird of some kind in there? Was that what they had hidden away up here on a concealed floor behind darkened, rocket- proof glass? Someone's aviary? There was certainly something flapping about in there, but it seemed like not so much a bird, more a kind of bird-shaped hole in space. 
He closed his eyes, which he'd been wanting to do for a bit anyway. He wondered what the hell to do next. Jump? Climb? He didn't think there was going to be any way of breaking in. OK, the supposedly rocket-proof glass hadn't stood up, when it came to it, to an actual 
rocket, but then that had been a rocket that had been fired at very short range from inside, which probably wasn't what the engineers who designed it had had in mind. It didn't mean he was going to be able to break the window here by wrapping his fist in his towel and punching. What the hell, he tried it anyway and hurt his fist. It was just as well he couldn't get a good swing from where he was sitting or he might have hurt it quite badly. The building had been sturdily reinforced when it was completely rebuilt after the Frogstar attack, and was probably the most heavily armoured publishing company in the business, but there was always, he thought, some weakness in any system designed by a corporate committee. He had already found one of them. The engineers who designed the windows had not expected them to be hit by a rocket from short range from the inside, so the window had failed. 
So, what would the engineers not be expecting someone sitting on the ledge outside the window to do? 
He wracked his brains for a moment or so before he got it. 
The thing they wouldn't be expecting him to do was to be there in the first place. Only an absolute idiot would be sitting where he was, so he was winning already. A common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools. 
He pulled his newly acquired credit card from his pocket, slid it into a crack where the window met its surrounding frame, and did something a rocket would not have been able to do. He wiggled it around a bit. He felt a catch slip. He slid the window open and almost fell backwards off the ledge laughing, giving thanks as he did so for the Great Ventilation and Telephone Riots of SrDt 3454. 
The Great Ventilation and Telephone Riots of SrDt 3454 had started off as just a lot of hot air. Hot air was, of course, the problem that ventilation was supposed to solve and generally it had solved the problem reasonably well up to the point when someone invented air- conditioning, which solved the problem far more throbbingly. 
And that was all well and good provided you could stand the noise and the dribbling until someone else came up with something even sexier and smarter than air-conditioning which was called in-building climate control. 
Now this was quite something. 
The major differences from just ordinary air-conditioning were that it was thrillingly more expensive, involved a huge amount of sophisticated measuring and regulating equipment which was far better at knowing, moment by moment, what kind of air people wanted to breathe than mere people did. 
It also meant that, to be sure that mere people didn't muck up the sophisticated calculations which the system was making on their behalf, all the windows in the buildings were built sealed shut. This is true. 
While the systems were being installed, a number of people who were going to work in the buildings found themselves having conversations with Breathe-o-Smart systems fitters which went something like this: 
"But what if we want to have the windows open?" 
"You won't want to have the windows open with new Breathe-o- Smart." 
"Yes but supposing we just wanted to have them open for a little bit?" 
"You won't want to have them open even for a little bit. The new Breathe-o-Smart system will see to that." 
"Hmmm." 
"Enjoy Breathe-o-Smart!" 
"OK, so what if the Breathe-o-Smart breaks down or goes wrong or something?" 
"Ah! One of the smartest features of the Breathe-o-Smart is that it cannot possibly go wrong. So. No worries on that score. Enjoy your breathing now, and have a nice day." 
(It was, of course, as a result of the Great Ventilation and Telephone Riots of SrDt 3454, that all mechanical or electrical or quantum-mechanical or hydraulic or even wind, steam or piston- driven devices, are now requited to have a certain legend emblazoned on them somewhere. It doesn't matter how small the object is, the designers of the object have got to find a way of squeezing the legend in somewhere, because it is their attention which is being drawn to it rather than necessarily that of the user's. 
The legend is this: 
"The major difference between a thing that might go wrong and a thing that cannot possibly go wrong is that when a thing that cannot possibly go wrong goes wrong it usually turns out to be impossible to get at or repair.') 
Major heat waves started to coincide, with almost magical precision, with major failures of the Breathe-o-Smart systems. To begin with this merely caused simmering resentment and only a few deaths from asphyxiation. 
The real horror erupted on the day that three events happened simultaneously. The first event was that Breathe-o-Smart Inc. issued a statement to the effect that best results were achieved by using their systems in temperate climates. 
The second event was the breakdown of a Breathe-o-Smart system on a particularly hot and humid day with the resulting evacuation of many hundreds of office staff into the street where they met the third event, which was a rampaging mob of long-distance telephone operators who had got so twisted with having to say, all day and every day, "Thank you for using BS&S" to every single idiot who picked up a phone that they had finally taken to the streets with trash cans, megaphones and rifles. 
In the ensuing days of carnage every single window in the city, rocket-proof or not, was smashed, usually to accompanying cries of "Get off the line, asshole! I don't care what number you want, what extension you're calling from. Go and stick a firework up your bottom! Yeeehaah! Hoo Hoo Hoo! Velooooom! Squawk!" and a variety of other animal noises that they didn't get a chance to practise in the normal line of their work. 
As a result of this, all telephone operators were granted a constitutional right to say "Use BS&S and die!" at least once an hour when answering the phone and all office buildings were required to have windows that opened, even if only a little bit. 
Another, unexpected result was a dramatic lowering of the suicide rate. All sorts of stressed and rising executives who had been forced, during the dark days of the Breathe-o-Smart tyranny, to jump in front of trains or stab themselves, could now just clamber out on to their own window ledges and leap off at their leisure. What frequently happened, though, was that in the moment or two they had to look around and gather their thoughts they would suddenly discover that 
all they had really needed was a breath of air and a fresh perspective on things, and maybe also a farm on which they could keep a few sheep. 
Another completely unlooked for result was that Ford Prefect, stranded thirteen stories up a heavily armoured building armed with nothing but a towel and a credit card was nevertheless able to clamber through a supposedly rocket-proof window to safety. 
He closed the window neatly after him, having first allowed Colin to follow him through, and then started to look around for this bird thing. 
The thing he realised about the windows was this: because they had been converted into openable windows after they had first been designed to be impregnable, they were, in fact, much less secure than if they had been designed as openable windows in the first place. 
Hey ho, it's a funny old life, he was just thinking to himself, when he suddenly realised that the room he had gone to all this trouble to break into was not a very interesting one. 
He stopped in surprise. 
Where was the strange flapping shape? Where was anything that was worth all this palaver-the extraordinary veil of secrecy that seemed to lie over this room and the equally extraordinary sequence of events that had seemed to conspire to get him into it? 
The room, like every other room in this building now, was done out in some appallingly tasteful grey. There were a few charts and drawings on the wall. Most of them were meaningless to Ford, but then he came across something that was obviously a mock-up for a poster of some kind. 
There was a kind of bird-like logo on it, and a slogan which said "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Mk II: the single most astounding thing of any kind ever. Coming soon to a dimension near you." No more information than that. 
Ford looked around again. Then his attention was gradually drawn to Colin, the absurdly over-happy security robot, who was cowering in a corner of the room gibbering with what seemed strangely like fear. 
Odd, thought Ford. He looked around to see what it was that Colin might have been reacting to. Then he saw something that he hadn't noticed before, lying quietly on top of a workbench. 
It was circular and black and about the size of a small side plate. Its top and its bottom were smoothly convex so that it resembled a small lightweight throwing discus. 
Its surfaces seemed to be completely smooth, unbroken and featureless. 
It was doing nothing. Then Ford noticed that there was something written on it. Strange. There hadn't been anything written on it a moment ago and now suddenly there was. There just didn't seem to have been any observable transition between the two states. 
All it said, in small, alarming letters was a single word: 
PANIC 
A moment ago there hadn't been any marks or cracks in its surface. Now there were. They were growing. 
Panic, the Guide Mk II said. Ford begin to do as he was told. He had just remembered why the slug-like creatures looked familiar. Their colour scheme was a kind of corporate grey, but in all other respects they looked exactly like Vogons. 
Chapter 13 
The ship dropped quietly to land on the edge of the wide clearing, a hundred yards or so from the village. 
It arrived suddenly and unexpectedly but with a minimum of fuss. One moment it was a perfectly ordinary late afternoon in the early autumn the leaves were just beginning to turn red and gold, the river was beginning to swell again with the rains from the mountains in the north, the plumage of the pikka birds was beginning to thicken in anticipation of the coming winter frosts, any day now the Perfectly Normal Beasts would start their thunderous migration across the plains, and Old Thrashbarg was beginning to mutter to himself as he hobbled his way around the village, a muttering which meant that he was rehearsing and elaborating the stories that he would tell of the past year once the evenings had drawn in and people had no choice but to gather round the fire and listen to him and grumble and say that that wasn't how they remembered it and the next moment there was a spaceship sitting there, gleaming in the warm autumn sun. 
It hummed for a bit and then stopped. 
It wasn't a big spaceship. If the villagers had been experts on spaceships they would have known at once that it was a pretty nifty one, a small sleek Hrundi four-berth runabout with just about every optional extra in the brochure except Advanced Vectoid Stabilisis, which only wimps went for. You can't get a good tight, sharp curve round a tri-lateral time axis with Advanced Vectoid Stabilisis. All right, it's a bit safer, but it makes the handling go all soggy. 
The villagers didn't know all that, of course. Most of them here on the remote planet of Lamuella had never seen a spaceship, certainly not one that was all in one piece, and as it shone warmly in the evening light it was just the most extraordinary thing they had come across since the day Kirp caught a fish with a head at both ends. 
Everybody had fallen silent. 
Whereas a moment before two or three dozen people had been wandering about, chattering, chopping wood, carrying water, teasing the pikka birds, or just amiably trying to stay out of Old Thrashbarg's way, suddenly all activity died away and everybody turned to look at the strange object in amazement. 
Or, not quite everybody. The pikka birds tended to be amazed by completely different things. A perfectly ordinary leaf lying unexpectedly on a stone would cause them to skitter off in paroxysms of confusion; sunrise took them completely by surprise every morning, but the arrival of an alien craft from another world simply failed to engage any part of their attention. They continued to kar and rit and huk as they pecked for seeds on the ground; the river continued with its quiet, spacious burbling. 
Also, the noise of loud and tuneless singing from the last hut on the left continued unabated. 
Suddenly, with a slight click and a hum, a door folded itself outwards and downwards from the spaceship. Then, for a minute or two, nothing further seemed to happen, other than the loud singing from the last hut on the left, and the thing just sat there. 
Some of the villagers, particularly the boys, began to edge forward a little bit to have a closer look. Old Thrashbarg tried to shoo them back. This was exactly the sort of thing that Old Thrashbarg didn't like to have happening. He hadn't foretold it, not even slightly, and even though he would be able to wrestle the whole thing into his continuing story somehow or other, it really was all getting a bit much to deal with. 
He strode forward, pushed the boys back, and raised his arms and his ancient knobbly staff into the air. The long warm light of the evening sun caught him nicely. He prepared to welcome whatever gods these were as if he had been expecting them all along. 
Still nothing happened. 
Gradually it became clear that there was some kind of argument going on inside the craft. Time went by and Old Thrashbarg's arms were beginning to ache. 
Suddenly the ramp folded itself back up again. That made it easy for Thrashbarg. They were demons and he had repulsed them. The reason he hadn't foretold it was that prudence and modesty forbade. 
Almost immediately a different ramp folded itself out on the other side of the craft from where Thrashbarg was standing, and two figures at last emerged on it, still arguing with each other and ignoring everybody, even Thrashbarg, whom they wouldn't even have noticed from where they were standing. 
Old Thrashbarg chewed angrily on his beard. 
To continue to stand there with his arms upraised? To kneel with his head bowed forward and his staff held out pointing at them? To fall backwards as if overcome in some titanic inner struggle? Perhaps just to go off to the woods and live in a tree for a year without speaking to anyone? 
He opted just to drop his arms smartly as if he had done what he meant to do. They were really hurting so he didn't have much choice. He made a small, secret sign he had just invented towards the ramp which had closed and then made three and a half steps backwards, so he could at least get a good look at whoever these people were and then decide what to do next. 
The taller one was a very good looking woman wearing soft and crumply clothes. Old Thrashbarg didn't know this, but they were made of RymplonTM, a new synthetic fabric which was terrific for space travel because it looked its absolute best when it was all creased and sweaty. 
The shorter one was a girl. She was awkward and sullen looking, and was wearing clothes which looked their absolute worst when they were all creased and sweaty, and what was more she almost certainly knew it. 
All eyes watched them, except for the pikka birds, which had their own things to watch. 
The woman stood and looked around her. She had a purposeful air about her. There was obviously something in particular she wanted, but she didn't know exactly where to find it. She glanced from face to face among the villagers assembled curiously around her without apparently seeing what she was looking for. 
Thrashbarg had no idea how to play this at all, and decided to resort to chanting. He threw back his head and began to wail, but was instantly interrupted by a fresh outbreak of song from the hut of the Sandwich Maker: the last one on the left. The woman looked round 
sharply, and gradually a smile came over her face. Without so much as a glance at Old Thrashbarg she started to walk towards the hut. 
There is an art to the business of making sandwiches which it is given to few ever to find the time to explore in depth. It is a simple task, but the opportunities for satisfaction are many and profound: choosing the right bread for instance. The Sandwich Maker had spent many months in daily consultation and experiment with Grarp the baker and eventually they had between them created a loaf of exactly the consistency that was dense enough to slice thinly and neatly, while still being light, moist and having that fine nutty flavour which best enhanced the savour of roast Perfectly Normal Beast flesh. 
There was also the geometry of the slice to be refined: the precise relationships between the width and height of the slice and also its thickness which would give the proper sense of bulk and weight to the finished sandwich: here again, lightness was a virtue, but so too were firmness, generosity and that promise of succulence and savour that is the hallmark of a truly intense sandwich experience. 
The proper tools, of course, were crucial, and many were the days that the Sandwich Maker, when not engaged with the Baker at his oven, would spend with Strinder the Tool Maker, weighing and balancing knives, taking them to the forge and back again. Suppleness, strength, keenness of edge, length and balance were all enthusiastically debated, theories put forward, tested, refined, and many was the evening when the Sandwich Maker and the Tool Maker could be seen silhouetted against the light of the setting sun and the Tool Maker's forge making slow sweeping movements through the air trying one knife after another, comparing the weight of this one with the balance of another, the suppleness of a third and the handle binding of a fourth. 
Three knives altogether were required. First there was the knife for the slicing of the bread: a firm, authoritative blade which imposed a clear and defining will on a loaf. Then there was the butter-spreading knife, which was a whippy little number but still with a firm backbone to it. Early versions had been a little too whippy, but now the combination of flexibility with a core of strength was exactly right to achieve the maximum smoothness and grace of spread. 
The chief amongst the knives, of course, was the carving knife. This was the knife that would not merely impose its will on the medium through which it moved, as did the bread knife; it must work with it, be Guided by the grain of the meat, to achieve slices of the most exquisite consistency and translucency, that would slide away in filmy folds from the main hunk of meat. The Sandwich Maker would then flip each sheet with a smooth flick of the wrist on to the beautifully proportioned lower bread slice, trim it with four deft strokes and then at last perform the magic that the children of the village so longed to gather round and watch with rapt attention and wonder. With just four more dexterous flips of the knife he would assemble the trimmings into a perfectly fitting jigsaw of pieces on top of the primary slice. For every sandwich the size and shape of the trimmings were different, but the Sandwich Maker would always effortlessly and without hesitation assemble them into a pattern which fitted perfectly. A second layer of meat and a second layer of trimmings, and the main act of creation would be accomplished. 
The Sandwich Maker would pass what he had made to his assistant who would then add a few slices of newcumber and fladish and a touch of splagberry sauce, and then apply the topmost layer of bread and cut the sandwich with a fourth and altogether plainer knife. It was not that these were not also skillful operations, but they were lesser skills to be performed by a dedicated apprentice who would one day, when the Sandwich Maker finally laid down his tools, take over from him. It was an exalted position and that apprentice, Drimple, was the envy of his fellows. There were those in the village who were happy chopping wood, those who were content carrying water, but to be the Sandwich Maker was very heaven. 
And so the Sandwich Maker sang as he worked. 
He was using the last of the year's salted meat. It was a little past its best now, but still the rich savour of Perfectly Normal Beast meat was something unsurpassed in any of the Sandwich Maker's previous experience. Next week it was anticipated that the Perfectly Normal Beasts would appear again for their regular migration, whereupon the whole village would once again be plunged into frenetic action: hunting the Beasts, killing perhaps six, maybe even seven dozen of the thousands that thundered past. Then the Beasts must be rapidly butchered and cleaned, with most of the meat salted to keep it 
through the winter months until the return migration in the spring, which would replenish their supplies. 
The very best of the meat would be roasted straight away for the feast that marked the Autumn Passage. The celebrations would last for three days of sheer exuberance, dancing and stories that Old Thrashbarg would tell of how the hunt had gone, stories that he would have been busy sitting making up in his hut while the rest of the village was out doing the actual hunting. 
And then the very, very best of the meat would be saved from the feast and delivered cold to the Sandwich Maker. And the Sandwich Maker would exercise on it the skills that he had brought to them from the gods, and make the exquisite Sandwiches of the Third Season, of which the whole village would partake before beginning, the next day, to prepare themselves for the rigours of the coming winter. 
Today he was just making ordinary sandwiches, if such delicacies, so lovingly crafted, could ever be called ordinary. Today his assistant was away so the Sandwich Maker was applying his own garnish, which he was happy to do. He was happy with just about everything in fact. 
He sliced, he sang. He flipped each slice of meat neatly on to a slice of bread, trimmed it and assembled all the trimmings into their jigsaw. A little salad, a little sauce, another slice of bread, another sandwich, another verse of Yellow Submarine. 
"Hello, Arthur."â¨The Sandwich Maker almost sliced his thumb off. 
The villagers had watched in consternation as the woman had marched boldly to the hut of the Sandwich Maker. The Sandwich Maker had been sent to them by Almighty Bob in a burning fiery chariot. This, at least, was what Thrashbarg said, and Thrashbarg was the authority on these things. So, at least, Thrashbarg claimed, and Thrashbarg was... and so on and so on. It was hardly worth arguing about. 
A few villagers wondered why Almighty Bob would send his onlie begotten Sandwich Maker in a burning fiery chariot rather than perhaps in one that might have landed quietly without destroying half 
the forest, filling it with ghosts and also injuring the Sandwich Maker quite badly. Old Thrashbarg said that it was the ineffable will of Bob, and when they asked him what ineffable meant he said look it up. 
This was a problem because Old Thrashbarg had the only dictionary and he wouldn't let them borrow it. They asked him why not and he said that it was not for them to know the will of Almighty Bob, and when they asked him why not again he said because he said so. Anyway, somebody sneaked into Old Thrashbarg's hut one day while he was out having a swim and looked up "ineffable". "Ineffable" apparently meant "unknowable, indescribable, unutterable, not to be known or spoken about". So that cleared that up. 
At least they had got the sandwiches. 
One day Old Thrashbarg said that Almighty Bob had decreed that he, Thrashbarg, was to have first pick of the sandwiches. The villagers asked him when this had happened, exactly, and Thrashbarg said it had happened yesterday, when they weren't looking. "Have faith," Old Thrashbarg said, "or burn!" They let him have first pick of the sandwiches. It seemed easiest. 
And now this woman had just arrived out of nowhere, and gone straight for the Sandwich Maker's hut. His fame had obviously spread, though it was hard to know where to since, according to Old Thrashbarg, there wasn't anywhere else. Anyway, wherever it was she had come from, presumably somewhere ineffable, she was here now and was in the Sandwich Maker's hut. Who was she? And who was the strange girl who was hanging around outside the hut moodily and kicking at stones and showing every sign of not wanting to be there? It seemed odd that someone should come all the way from somewhere ineffable in a chariot that was obviously a vast improvement on the burning fiery one which had brought them the Sandwich Maker, if she didn't even want to be here? 
They all looked to Thrashbarg, but he was on his knees mumbling and looking very firmly up into the sky and not catching anybody else's eye until he'd thought of something. 
"Trillian!" said the Sandwich Maker, sucking his bleeding thumb. "What...? Who...? When...? Where...?" 
"Exactly the questions I was going to ask you," said Trillian, looking around Arthur's hut. It was neatly laid out with his kitchen utensils. There were some fairly basic cupboards and shelves, and a basic bed in the corner. A door at the back of the room led to something Trillian couldn't see because the door was closed. "Nice," she said, but in an enquiring tone of voice. She couldn't quite make out what the set-up was. 
"Very nice," said Arthur. "Wonderfully nice. I don't know when I've ever been anywhere nicer. I'm happy here. They like me, I make sandwiches for them, and... er, well that's it really. They like me and I make sandwiches for them." 
"Sounds, er..." 
"Idyllic," said Arthur, firmly. "It is. It really is. I don't expect you'd like it very much, but for me it's, well, it's perfect. Look, sit down, please, make yourself comfortable. Can I get you anything, er, a sandwich?" 
Trillian picked up a sandwich and looked at it. She sniffed it carefully. 
"Try it," said Arthur, "it's good."â¨Trillian took a nibble, then a bite and munched on it thoughtfully. "It is good," she said, looking at it. 
"My life's work," said Arthur, trying to sound proud and hoping he didn't sound like a complete idiot. He was used to being revered a bit, and was having to go through some unexpected mental gear changes. 
"What's the meat in it?" asked Trillian. 
"Ah yes, that's, um, that's Perfectly Normal Beast." 
"It's what?" 
"Perfectly Normal Beast. It's a bit like a cow, or rather a bull. Kind of like a buffalo in fact. Large, charging sort of animal." 
"So what's odd about it?"â¨"Nothing, it's Perfectly Normal."â¨"I see."â¨"It's just a bit odd where it comes from." Tricia frowned, and stopped chewing. 
"Where does it come from?" she asked with her mouth full. She wasn't going to swallow until she knew. 
"Well it's not just a matter of where it comes from, it's also where it goes to. It's all right, it's perfectly safe to swallow. I've eaten tons of it. It's great. Very succulent. Very tender. Slightly sweet flavour with a long dark finish." 
Trillian still hadn't swallowed. 
"Where," she said, "does it come from, and where does it go to?" 
"They come from a point just slightly to the east of the Hondo Mountains. They're the big ones behind us here, you must have seen them as you came in, and then they sweep in their thousands across the great Anhondo plains and, er, well that's it really. That's where they come from. That's where they go." 
Trillian frowned. There was something she wasn't quite getting about this. 
"I probably haven't made it quite clear," said Arthur. "When I say they come from a point to the east of the Hondo Mountains, I mean that that's where they suddenly appear. Then they sweep across the Anhondo plains and, well, vanish really. We have about six days to catch as many of them as we can before they disappear. In the spring they do it again only the other way round, you see." 
Reluctantly, Trillian swallowed. It was either that or spit it out, and it did in fact taste pretty good. 
"I see," she said, once she had reassured herself that she didn't seem to be suffering any ill effects. "And why are they called Perfectly Normal Beasts?" 
"Well, I think because otherwise people might think it was a bit odd. I think Old Thrashbarg called them that. He says that they come from where they come from and they go to where they go to and that it's Bob's will and that's all there is to it." 
"Who..."â¨"Just don't even ask." "Well, you look well on it." "I feel well. You look well." "I'm well. I'm very well." "Well, that's good."â¨"Yes."â¨"Good." 
"Good." 
"Nice of you to drop in." 
"Thanks." 
"Well," said Arthur, casting around himself. Astounding how hard it was to think of anything to say to someone after all this time. 
"I expect you're wondering how I found you," said Trillian. 
"Yes!" said Arthur. "I was wondering exactly that. How did you find me?" 
"Well, as you may or may not know, I now work for one of the big Sub-Etha broadcasting networks that " 
"I did know that," said Arthur, suddenly remembering. "Yes, you've done very well. That's terrific. Very exciting. Well done. Must be a lot of fun." 
"Exhausting." 
"All that rushing around. I expect it must be, yes." 
"We have access to virtually every kind of information. I found your name on the passenger list of the ship that crashed." 
Arthur was astonished. 
"You mean they knew about the crash?" 
"Well, of course they knew. You don't have a whole spaceliner disappear without someone knowing about it." 
"But you mean, they knew where it had happened? They knew I'd survived?" 
"Yes." 
"But nobody's ever been to look or search or rescue. There's been absolutely nothing." 
"Well there wouldn't be. It's a whole complicated insurance thing. They just bury the whole thing. Pretend it never happened. The insurance business is completely screwy now. You know they've reintroduced the death penalty for insurance company directors?" 
"Really?" said Arthur. "No I didn't. For what offence?" Trillian frowned.â¨"What do you mean, offence?"â¨"I see." 
Trillian gave Arthur a long look, and then, in a new tone of voice, said, "It's time for you to take responsibility, Arthur." 
Arthur tried to understand this remark. He found it often took a moment or so before he saw exactly what it was that people were driving at, so he let a moment or two pass at a leisurely rate. Life was so pleasant and relaxed these days, there was time to let things sink in. He let it sink in. 
He still didn't quite understand what she meant, though, so in the end he had to say so. 
Trillian gave him a cool smile and then turned back to the door of the hut. 
"Random?" she called. "Come in. Come and meet your father." 
Chapter 14 
As the Guide folded itself back into a smooth, dark disk, Ford realised some pretty hectic stuff. Or at least he tried to realise it, but it was too hectic to take in all in one go. His head was hammering, his ankle was hurting, and though he didn't like to be a wimp about his ankle, he always found that intense multi-dimensional logic was something he understood best in the bath. He needed time to think about this. Time, a tall drink, and some kind of rich, foamy oil. 
He had to get out of here. He had to get the Guide out of here. He didn't think they'd make it together. 
He glanced wildly round the room. 
Think, think, think. It had to be something simple and obvious. If he was right in his nasty lurking suspicion that he was dealing with nasty, lurking Vogons, then the more simple and obvious the better. 
Suddenly he saw what he needed. 
He wouldn't try to beat the system, he would just use it. The frightening thing about the Vogons was their absolute mindless determination to do whatever mindless thing it was they were determined to do. There was never any point in trying to appeal to their reason because they didn't have any. However, if you kept your nerve you could sometimes exploit their blinkered, bludgeoning insistence on being bludgeoning and blinkered. It wasn't merely that their left hand didn't always know what their right hand was doing, so to speak; quite often their right hand had a pretty hazy notion as well. 
Did he dare just post the thing to himself? 
Did he dare just put it in the system and let the Vogons work out how to get the thing to him while at the same time they were busy, as they probably would be, tearing the building apart to find out where he'd hidden it? 
Yes. 
Feverishly, he packed it. He wrapped it. He labelled it. With a moment's pause to wonder if he was really doing the right thing, he committed the package to the building's internal mail chute. 
"Colin," he said, turning to the little, hovering ball. "I am going to abandon you to your fate." 
"I'm so happy," said Colin. 
"Make the most of it," said Ford. "Because what I want you to do is to nursemaid that package out of the building. They'll probably incinerate you when they find you, and I won't be here to help. It will be very, very nasty for you, and that's just too bad. Got it?" 
"I gurgle with pleasure," said Colin. 
"Go!" said Ford. 
Colin obediently dived down the mail chute in pursuit of his charge. Now Ford had only himself to worry about, but that was still quite a substantial worry. There were noises of heavy running footsteps outside the door, which he had taken the precaution of locking and shifting a large filing cabinet in front of. 
He was worried that everything had gone so smoothly. Everything had fitted terribly well. He had hurtled through the day with reckless abandon and yet everything had worked out with uncanny neatness. Except for his shoe. He was bitter about his shoe. That was an account that was going to have to be settled. 
With a deafening roar the door exploded inwards. In the turmoil of smoke and dust he could see large, slug-like creatures hurrying through. 
So everything was going well was it? Everything was working out as if the most extraordinary luck was on his side? Well, he'd see about that. 
In a spirit of scientific enquiry he hurled himself out of the window again. 
Chapter 15 
The first month, getting to know each other, was a little difficult. 
The second month, trying to come to terms with what they'd got to know about each other in the first month, was much easier. 
The third month, when the box arrived, was very tricky indeed. 
At the beginning, it was a problem even trying to explain what a month was. This had been a pleasantly simple matter for Arthur, here on Lamuella. The days were just a little over twenty-five hours long, which basically meant an extra hour in bed every single day and, of course, having regularly to reset his watch, which Arthur rather enjoyed doing. 
He also felt at home with the number of suns and moons which Lamuella had one of each as opposed to some of the planets he'd fetched up on from time to time which had had ridiculous numbers of them. 
The planet orbited its single sun every three hundred days, which was a good number because it meant the year didn't drag by. The moon orbited Lamuella just over nine times a year, which meant that a month was a little over thirty days, which was absolutely perfect because it gave you a little more time to get things done in. It was not merely reassuringly like Earth, it was actually rather an improvement. 
Random, on the other hand, thought she was trapped in a recurring nightmare. She would have crying fits and think the moon was out to get her. Every night it was there, and then, when it went, the sun came out and followed her. Over and over again. 
Trillian had warned Arthur that Random might have some difficulty in adjusting to a more regular lifestyle than she had been used to up till now, but Arthur hadn't been ready for actual howling at the moon. 
He hadn't been ready for any of this of course. His daughter? 
His daughter? He and Trillian had never even had they? He was absolutely convinced he would have remembered. What about Zaphod? 
"Not the same species, Arthur," Trillian had answered. "When I decided I wanted a child they ran all sorts of genetic tests on me and could find only one match anywhere. It was only later that it dawned on me. I double checked and I was right. They don't usually like to tell you, but I insisted." 
"You mean you went to a DNA bank?" Arthur had asked, pop-eyed. 
"Yes. But she wasn't quite as random as her name suggests, because, of course, you were the only homo sapiens donor. I must say, though, it seems you were quite a frequent flyer." 
Arthur had stared wide-eyed at the unhappy looking girl who was slouching awkwardly in the door-frame looking at him. 
"But when... how long...?"â¨"You mean, what age is she?" "Yes."â¨"The wrong one."â¨"What do you mean?"â¨"I mean that I haven't any idea." "What?" 
"Well, in my time line I think it's about ten years since I had her, but she's obviously quite a lot older than that. I spend my life going backwards and forwards in time, you see. The job. I used to take her with me when I could, but it just wasn't always possible. Then I used to put her into day care time zones, but you just can't get reliable time tracking now. You leave them there in the morning, you've simply no idea how old they'll be in the evening. You complain till you're blue in the face but it doesn't get you anywhere. I left her at one of the places for a few hours once, and when I came back she'd passed puberty. I've done all I can, Arthur, it's over to you. I've got a war to cover." 
The ten seconds that passed after Trillian left were about the longest of Arthur Dent's life. Time, we know, is relative. You can travel light years through the stars and back, and if you do it at the speed of light then, when you return, you may have aged mere seconds while 
your twin brother or sister will have aged twenty, thirty, forty or however many years it is, depending on how far you travelled. 
This will come to you as a profound personal shock, particularly if you didn't know you had a twin brother or sister. The seconds that you have been absent for will not have been sufficient time to prepare you for the shock of new and strangely distended family relationships when you return. 
Ten seconds silence was not enough time for Arthur to reassemble his whole view of himself and his life in a way that suddenly included an entire new daughter of whose merest existence he had had not the slightest inkling of a suspicion when he had woken that morning. Deep, emotional family ties cannot be constructed in ten seconds, however far and fast you travel away from them, and Arthur could only feel helpless, bewildered and numb as he looked at the girl standing in his doorway, staring at his floor. 
He supposed that there was no point in pretending not to be hopeless. 
He walked over and he hugged her. 
"I don't love you," he said. "I'm sorry. I don't even know you yet. But give me a few minutes." 
We live in strange times. 
We also live in strange places: each in a universe of our own. The people with whom we populate our universes are the shadows of whole other universes intersecting with our own. Being able to glance out into this bewildering complexity of infinite recursion and say things like, "Oh, hi Ed! Nice tan. How's Carol?" involves a great deal of filtering skill for which all conscious entities have eventually to develop a capacity in order to protect themselves from the contemplation of the chaos through which they seethe and tumble. So give your kid a break, OK?

"What's this?" 
Arthur had almost given up. That is to say, he was not going to give up. He was absolutely not going to give up. Not now. Not ever. But if 
he had been the sort of person who was going to give up, this was probably the time he would have done it. 
Not content with being surly, bad-tempered, wanting to go and play in the paleozoic era, not seeing why they had to have the gravity on the whole time and shouting at the sun to stop following her, Random had also used his carving knife to dig up stones to throw at the pikka birds for looking at her like that. 
Arthur didn't even know if Lamuella had had a paleozoic era. According to Old Thrashbarg the planet had been found fully-formed in the navel of a giant earwig at four-thirty one Vroonday afternoon, and although Arthur, as a seasoned galactic traveller with good "O" level passes in Physics and Geography, had fairly serious doubts about this, it was rather a waste of time trying to argue with Old Thrashbarg and there had never been much point before. 
He sighed as he sat nursing the chipped and bent knife. He was going to love her if it killed him, or her, or both. It wasn't easy being a father. He knew that no one had ever said it was going to be easy, but that wasn't the point because he'd never asked about being one in the first place. 
He was doing his best. Every moment that he could wrest away from making sandwiches he was spending with her, talking to her, walking with her, sitting on the hill with her watching the sun go down over he valley in which the village nestled, trying to find out about her life, trying to explain to her about his. It was a tricky business. The common ground between them, apart from the fact that they had almost identical genes, was about the size of a pebble. Or rather, it was about the size of Trillian and of her they had slightly differing views. 
"What's this?" 
He suddenly realised she had been talking to him and he hadn't noticed. Or rather he had not recognized her voice. 
Instead of the usual tone of voice in which she spoke to him, which was bitter and truculent, she was just asking him a simple question. 
He looked round in surprise. 
She was sitting there on a stool in the corner of the hut in that rather hunched way she had, knees together, feet splayed out, with 
her dark hair hanging down over her face as she looked at something she had cradled in her hands. 
Arthur went over to her, a little nervously. 
Her mood swings were very unpredictable but so far they'd all been between different types of bad ones. Outbreaks of bitter recrimination would give way without warning to abject self-pity and then long bouts of sullen despair which were punctuated with sudden acts of mindless violence against inanimate objects and demands to go to electric clubs. 
Not only were there no electric clubs on Lamuella, there were no clubs at all and, in fact, no electricity. There was a forge and a bakery, a few carts and a well, but those were the high water mark of Lamuellan technology, and a fair number of Random's unquenchable rages were directed against the sheer incomprehensible backwardness of the place. 
She could pick up Sub-Etha TV on a small Flex-O-Panel which had been surgically implanted in her wrist, but that didn't cheer her up at all because it was full of news of insanely exciting things happening in every other part of the Galaxy than here. It would also give her frequent news of her mother, who had dumped her to go off and cover some war which now seemed not to have happened, or at least to have gone all wrong in some way because of the absence of any proper intelligence gathering. It also gave her access to lots of great adventure shows featuring all sorts of fantastically expensive spaceships crashing into each other. 
The villagers were absolutely hypnotised by all these wonderful magic images flashing over her wrist. They had only ever seen one spaceship crash, and it had been so frightening, violent and shocking and had caused so much horrible devastation, fire and death that, stupidly, they had never realised it was entertainment. 
Old Thrashbarg had been so astonished by it that he had instantly seen Random as an emissary from Bob, but had fairly soon afterwards decided that in fact she had been sent as a test of his faith, if not of his patience. He was also alarmed at the number of spaceship crashes he had to start incorporating into his holy stories if he was to hold the attention of the villagers, and not have them rushing off to peer at Random's wrist all the time. 
At the moment she was not peering at her wrist. Her wrist was turned off. Arthur squatted down quietly beside her to see what she was looking at. 
It was his watch. He had taken it off when he'd gone to shower under the local waterfall, and Random had found it and was trying to work it out. 
"It's just a watch," he said. "It's to tell the time." 
"I know that," she said. "But you keep on fiddling with it, and it still doesn't tell the right time. Or even anything like it." 
She brought up the display on her wrist panel, which automatically produced a readout of local time. Her wrist panel had quietly got on with the business of measuring the local gravity and orbital momentum, and had noticed where the sun was and tracked its movement in the sky, all within the first few minutes of Random's arrival. It had then quickly picked up clues from its environment as to what the local unit conventions were and reset itself appropriately. It did this sort of thing continually, which was particularly valuable if you did a lot of travelling in time as well as space. 
Random frowned at her father's watch, which didn't do any of this. 
Arthur was very fond of it. It was a better one than he would ever have afforded himself. He had been given it on his twenty-second birthday by a rich and guilt-ridden godfather who had forgotten every single birthday he had had up till then, and also his name. It had the day, the date, the phases of the moon; it had "To Albert on his twenty-first birthday" and the wrong date engraved on the battered and scratched surface of its back in letters that were still just about visible. 
The watch had been through a considerahle amount of stuff in the last few years, most of which would fall well outside the warranty. He didn't suppose, of course, that the warranty had especially mentioned that the watch was guaranteed to be accurate only within the very particular gravitational and magnetic fields of the Earth, and so long as the day was twenty-four hours long and the planet didn't explode and so on. These were such basic assumptions that even the lawyers would have missed them. 
Luckily his watch was a wind-up one, or at least, a self-winder. Nowhere else in the Galaxy would he have found batteries of 
precisely the dimensions and power specifications that were perfectly standard on Earth. 
"So what are all these numbers?" asked Random. 
Arthur took it from her. 
"These numbers round the edge mark the hours. In the little window on the right it says THU, which means Thursday, and the number is 14, which means it's the fourteenth day of the month of MAY which is what it says in this window over here. 
"And this sort of crescent-shaped window at the top tells you about the phases of the moon. In other words it tells you how much of the moon is lit up at night by the sun, which depends on the relative positions of the Sun and the Moon and, well... the Earth." 
"The Earth," said Random.â¨"Yes."â¨"And that's where you came from, and where Mum came from." "Yes." 
Random took the watch back from him and looked at it again, clearly baffled by something. Then she held it up to her ear and listened in puzzlement. 
"What's that noise?" 
"It's ticking. That's the mechanism that drives the watch. It's called clockwork. It's all kind of interlocking cogs and springs that work to turn the hands round at exactly the right speed to mark the hours and minutes and days and so on." 
Random carried on peering at it.â¨"There's something puzzling you," said Arthur. "What is it?" "Yes," said Random, at last. "Why's it all in hardware?" 
Arthur suggested they went for a walk. He felt there were things they should discuss, and for once Random seemed, if not precisely amenable and willing, then at least not growling. 
From Random's point of view this was also all very weird. It wasn't that she wanted to be difficult, as such, it was just that she didn't know how or what else to be. 
Who was this guy? What was this life she was supposed to lead? What was this world she was supposed to lead it in? And what was 
this universe that kept coming at her through her eyes and ears? What was it for? What did it want? 
She'd been born in a spaceship that had been going from somewhere to somewhere else, and when it had got to somewhere else, somewhere else had only turned out to be another somewhere that you had to get to somewhere else again from, and so on. 
It was her normal expectation that she was supposed to be somewhere else. It was normal for her to feel that she was in the wrong place. 
Then, constant time travel had only compounded this problem, and had led to the feeling that she was not only always in the wrong place, but she was also almost always there at the wrong time. 
She didn't notice that she felt this, because it was the only way she ever felt, just as it never seemed odd to her that nearly everywhere she went she needed either to wear weights or anti-gravity suits and usually special apparatus for breathing as well. The only places you could ever feel right were worlds you designed for yourself to inhabit- virtual realities in the electric clubs. It had never occurred to her that the real Universe was something you could actually fit into. 
And that included this Lamuella place her mother had dumped her in. And it also included this person who had bestowed on her this precious and magical gift of life in return for a seat upgrade. It was just as well he had turned out to be rather kind and friendly or there would have been trouble. Really. She'd got a specially sharpened stone in her pocket she could cause a lot of trouble with. 
It can be very dangerous to see things from somebody else's point of view without the proper training. 
They sat on the spot that Arthur particularly liked, on the side of a hill overlooking the valley. The sun was going down over the village. 
The only thing that Arthur wasn't quite so fond of was being able to see a little way into the next valley, where a deep dark mangled furrow in the forest marked the spot where his ship had crashed. But maybe that was what kept bringing him back here. There were plenty of spots from which you could survey the lush rolling countryside of Lamuella, but this was the one he was drawn to, with its nagging dark spot of fear and pain nestling just on the edge of his vision. 
He had never been there again since he had been pulled out of the wreckage. 
Wouldn't. 
Couldn't bear it. 
In fact he had gone some of the way back to it the very next day, while he was still numb and spinning with shock. He had a broken leg, a couple of broken ribs, some bad burns and was not really thinking coherently but had insisted that the villagers take him, which, uneasily, they had. He had not managed to get right to the actual spot where the ground had bubbled and melted, however, and had at last hobbled away from the horror for ever. 
Soon, word had got around that the whole area was haunted and no one had ventured back there ever since. The land was full of beautiful, verdant and delightful valleys no point in going to a highly worrying one. Let the past hold on to itself and let the present move forward into the future. 
Random cradled the watch in her hands, slowly turning it to let the long light of the evening sun shine warmly in the scratches and scuffs of the thick glass. It fascinated her watching the spidery little second hand ticking its way round. Every time it completed a full circle, the longer of the two main hands had moved on exactly to the next of the sixty small divisions round the dial. And when the long hand had made its own full circle. the smaller hand had moved on to the next of the main digits. 
"You've been watching it for over an hour." said Arthur, quietly. 
"I know, she said. "An hour is when the big hand has gone all the way round, yes?" 
"That's right." 
"Then I've been watching it for an hour and seventeen... minutes." 
She smiled with a deep and mysterious pleasure and moved very slightly so that she was resting just a little. Against his arm. Arthur felt a small sigh escape from him that had been pent up inside his chest for weeks. He wanted to put his arm around his daughter's shoulders, but felt it was too early yet and that she would shy away from him. But something was working. Something was easing inside her. The watch meant something to her that nothing in her life had so far 
managed to do. Arthur was not sure that he had really understood what it was yet, but he was profoundly pleased and relieved that something had reached her. 
"Explain to me again," said Random. 
"There's nothing really to it," said Arthur. "Clockwork was something that developed over hundreds of years..." 
"Earth years." 
"Yes. It became finer and finer and more and more intricate. It was highly skilled and delicate work. It had to be made very small, and it had to carry on working accurately however much you waved it around or dropped it." 
"But only on one planet?" 
"Well, that was where it was made, you see. It was never expected to go anywhere else and deal with different suns and moons and magnetic fields and things. I mean the thing still goes perfectly well, but it doesn't really mean much this far from Switzerland." 
"From where?" 
"Switzerland. That's where these were made. Small hilly country. Tiresomely neat. The people who made them didn't really know there were other worlds." 
"Quite a big thing not to know." 
"Well, yes." 
"So where did they come from?" 
"They, that is we... we just sort of grew there. We evolved on the Earth. From, I don't know, some kind of sludge or something." 
"Like this watch." 
"Um. I don't think the watch grew out of sludge." 
"You don't understand!" 
Random suddenly leaped to her feet, shouting. 
"You don't understand! You don't understand me, you don't understand anything! I hate you for being so stupid!" 
She started to run hectically down the hill, still clutching the watch and shouting that she hated him. 
Arthur jumped up, startled and at a loss. He started to run after her through the stringy and clumpy grass. It was hard and painful for him. When he had broken his leg in the crash, it had not been a clean 
break, and it had not healed cleanly. He was stumbling and wincing as he ran. 
Suddenly she turned and faced him, her face dark with anger. 
She brandished the watch at him. "You don't understand that there's somewhere this belongs? Somewhere it works? Somewhere that it fits?" 
She turned and ran again. She was fit and fleet-footed and Arthur could not remotely keep up with her. 
It wasn't that he had not expected being a father to be this difficult, it was that he hadn't expected to be a father at all, particularly not suddenly and unexpectedly on an alien planet. 
Random turned to shout at him again. For some reason he stopped each time she did. 
"Who do you think I am?" she demanded angrily. "Your upgrade? Who do you think Mum thought I was? Some sort of ticket to the life she didn't have?" 
"I don't know what you mean by that," said Arthur, panting and hurting. 
"You don't know what anybody means by anything!" 
"What do you mean?" 
"Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!" 
"Tell me! Please tell me! What does she mean by saying the life she didn't have?" 
"She wished she'd stayed on Earth! She wished she hadn't gone off with that stupid brain-dead fruit gum, Zaphod! She thinks she would have had a different life!" 
"But," said Arthur, "she would have been killed! She would have been killed when the world was destroyed!" 
"That's a different life isn't it?"â¨"That's..."â¨"She wouldn't have had to have me! She hates me!"â¨"You can't mean that! How could anyone possibly, er, I mean..." 
"She had me because I was meant to make things fit for her. That was my job. But I fitted even worse than she did! So she just shut me off and carried on with her stupid life." 
"What's stupid about her life? She's fantastically successful, isn't she? She's all over time and space, all over the Sub-Etha TV networks..." 
"Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!" 
Random turned and ran off again. Arthur couldn't keep up with her and at last he had to sit down for a bit and let the pain in his leg subside. The turmoil in his head he didn't know what to do with at all. 
He hobbled into the village an hour later. It was getting dark. The villagers he passed said hello, but there was a sense of nervousness and of not quite knowing what was going on or what to do about it in the air. Old Thrashbarg had been seen pulling on his beard a fair bit and looking at the moon, and that was not a good sign either. 
Arthur went into his hut.â¨Random was sitting hunched quietly over the table. "I'm sorry," she said. "I'm so sorry." 
"That's all right," said Arthur as gently as he knew how. "It's good to, well, to have a little chat. There's so much we have to learn and understand about each other, and life isn't, well it isn't all just tea and sandwiches..." 
"I'm so sorry," she said again, sobbing. 
Arthur went up to her and put his arm round her shoulder. She didn't resist or pull away. Then Arthur saw what it was she was so sorry about. 
In the pool of light thrown by a Lamuellan lantern lay Arthur's watch. Random had forced the back off it with the back edge of the butter spreading knife, and all of the minute cogs and springs and levers were lying in a tiny cock-eyed mess where she'd been fiddling with them. 
"I just wanted to see how it worked," said Random, "how it all fitted together. I'm so sorry! I can't get it back together. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I don't know what to do. I'll get it repaired! Really! I'll get it repaired!" 
The following day Thrashbarg came round and said all sorts of Bob stuff. He tried to exert a calming influence by inviting Random to let her mind dwell on the ineffable mystery of the giant earwig, and 
Random said there was no giant earwig and Thrashbarg went very cold and silent and said she would be cast into outer darkness. Random said good, she'd been born there, and the next day the parcel arrived. 
This was all getting a bit eventful. 
In fact, when the parcel arrived, delivered by a kind of robot drone that dropped out of the sky making droning robot noises, it brought with it a sense which gradually began to permeate through the whole village, that it was almost one event too many. 
It wasn't the robot drone's fault. All it required was Arthur Dent's signature or thumb print, or just a few scrapings of skin cells from the nape of his neck and it would be on its way again. It hung around waiting, not quite sure what all this resentment was about. Meanwhile, Kirp had caught another fish with a head at both ends, but on closer inspection it turned out that it was in fact two fish cut in half and sewn together rather badly, so not only had Kirp failed to rekindle any great interest in two-headed fish but he had seriously cast doubt on the authenticity of the first one. Only the pikka birds seemed to feel that everything was exactly normal. 
The robot drone got Arthur's signature and made its escape. Arthur bore the parcel back to his hut and sat and looked at it. 
"Let's open it!" said Random, who was feeling much more cheerful this morning now that everything around her had got thoroughly weird, but Arthur said no. 
"Why not?" 
"It's not addressed to me." 
"Yes, it is." 
"No, it isn't. It's addressed to... well, it's addressed to Ford Prefect, in care of me." 
"Ford Prefect? Is he the one who..." "Yes," said Arthur tartly.â¨"I've heard about him."â¨"I expect you have." 
"Let's open it anyway. What else are we going to do?" 
"I don't know," said Arthur, who really wasn't sure. He had taken his damaged knives over to the forge bright and early that morning and Strinder had had a look at them and said that he would see what he could do. 
They had tried the usual business of waving the knives through the air, feeling for the point of balance and the point of flex and so on, but the joy was gone from it, and Arthur had a sad feeling that his sandwich making days were probably numbered. 
He hung his head. 
The next appearance of the Perfectly Normal Beasts was imminent, but Arthur felt that the usual festivities of hunting and feasting were going to be rather muted and uncertain. Something had happened here on Lamuella, and Arthur had a horrible feeling that it was him. 
"What do you think it is?" urged Random, turning the parcel over in her hands. 
"I don't know, said Arthur. "Something bad and worrying, though." 
"How do you know?" Random protested. 
"Because anything to do with Ford Prefect is bound to be worse and more worrying than something that isn't," said Arthur. "Believe me." 
"You're upset about something, aren't you?" said Random. Arthur sighed.â¨"I'm just feeling a little jumpy and unsettled, I think," said Arthur. 
"I'm sorry," said Random, and put the package down again. She could see that it really would upset him if she opened it. She would just have to do it when he wasn't looking. 
Chapter 16 
Arthur wasn't quite certain which he noticed as being missing first. When he noticed that the one wasn't there his mind instantly leapt to the other and he knew immediately that they were both gone and that something insanely bad and difficult to deal with would happen as a result. 
Random was not there. And neither was the parcel. 
He had left it up on a shelf all day, in plain view. It was an exercise in trust. 
He knew that one of the things he was supposed to do as a parent was to show trust in his child, to build a sense of trust and confidence into the bedrock of relationship between them. He had had a nasty feeling that that might be an idiotic thing to do, but he did it anyway, and sure enough it had turned out to be an idiotic thing to do. You live and learn. At any rate, you live. 
You also panic. 
Arthur ran out of the hut. It was the middle of the evening. The light was getting dim and a storm was brewing. He could not see her anywhere, nor any sign of her. He asked. No one had seen her. He asked again. No one else had seen her. They were going home for the night. A little wind was whipping round the edge of the village, picking things up and tossing them around in a dangerously casual manner. 
He found Old Thrashbarg and asked him. Thrashbarg looked at him stonily, and then pointed in the one direction that Arthur had dreaded, and had therefore instinctively known was the way she would have gone. 
So now he knew the worst. 
She had gone where she thought he would not follow her. 
He looked up at the sky, which was sullen, streaked and livid, and reflected that it was the sort of sky that the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse wouldn't feel like a bunch of complete idiots riding out of. 
With a heavy sense of the utmost foreboding he set off on the track that led to the forest in the next valley. The first heavy blobs of rain began to hit the ground as Arthur tried to drag himself to some sort of run. Random reached the crest of the hill and looked down into the next valley. It had been a longer and harder climb than she had anticipated. She was a little worried that doing the trip at night was not that great an idea, but her father had been mooching around near the hut all day trying to pretend to either her or himself that he wasn't guarding the parcel. At last he'd had to go over to the forge to talk with Strinder about the knives, and Random had seized her opportunity and done a runner with the parcel. 
It was perfectly clear that she couldn't just open the thing there, in the hut, or even in the village. He might have come across her at any moment. Which meant that she had to go where she wouldn't be followed. 
She could stop where she was now. She had gone this way in the hope that he wouldn't follow her. And even if he did he would never find her up in the wooded parts of the hill with night drawing in and the rain starting. 
All the way up, the parcel had been jiggling under her arm. It was a satisfyingly hunky sort of thing: a box with a square top about the length of her forearm on each side, and about the length of her hand deep, wrapped up in brown plasper with an ingenious new form of self-knotting string. It didn't rattle as she shook it, but she sensed that its weight was concentrated excitingly at the centre. 
Having come so far, though, there was a certain satisfaction in not stopping here, but carrying on down into what seemed to be almost a forbidden area where her father's ship had come down. She wasn't exactly certain what the word "haunted" meant, but it might be fun to find out. She would keep going and save the parcel up for when she got there. 
It was getting darker, though. She hadn't used her tiny electric torch yet, because she didn't want to be visible from a distance. She would have to use it now, but it probably didn't matter since she would be on the other side of the hill which divided the valleys from each other. 
She turned her torch on. Almost at the same moment a fork of lightning ripped across the valley into which she was heading and 
startled her considerably. As the darkness shuddered back around her and a clap of thunder rolled out across the land she felt suddenly rather small and lost with just a feeble pencil of light bobbing in her hand. Perhaps she should stop after all and open the parcel here. Or maybe she should go back and come out again tomorrow. It was only a momentary hesitation, though. She knew there was no going back tonight, and sensed that there was no going back ever. 
She headed on down the side of the hill. The rain was beginning to pick up now. Where a short while ago it had been a few heavy blobs it was settling in for a good pour now, hissing in the trees, and the ground was getting slippery under her feet. 
At least, she thought it was the rain hissing in the trees. Shadows were leaping and leering at her as her light bobbed through the trees. Onwards and downwards. 
She hurried on for another ten or fifteen minutes, soaked to the skin now and shivering, and gradually became aware that there seemed to be some other light somewhere ahead of her. It was very faint and she wasn't certain if she was imagining it or not. She turned off her torch to see. There did seem to be some sort of dim glow ahead. She couldn't tell what it was. She turned her torch back on and continued down the hill, towards whatever it was. 
There was something wrong with the woods though. 
She couldn't immediately say what it was, but they didn't seem like sprightly healthy woods looking forward to a good spring. The trees were lolling at sickly angles and had a sort of pallid, blighted look about them. Random more than once had the worrying sensation that they were trying to reach towards her as she passed them, but it was just a trick of the way that her light caused their shadows to flicker and lurch. 
Suddenly, something fell out of a tree in front of her. She leapt backwards with alarm, dropping both the torch and the box as she did so. She went down into a crouch, pulling the specially sharpened rock out of her pocket. 
The thing that had fallen out of the tree was moving. The torch was lying on the ground and pointing towards it, and a vast, grotesque shadow was slowly lurching through the light towards her. She could hear faint rustling and screeching noises over the steady hiss of the 
rain. She scrabbled on the ground for the torch, found it, and shone it directly at the creature. 
At the same moment another dropped from a tree just a few feet away. She swung the torch wildly from one to another. She held her rock up, ready to throw. 
They were quite small in fact. It was the angle of the light that had made them loom so large. Not only small. But small, furry and cuddly. And there was another, dropping from the trees. It fell through the beam of light, so she saw it quite clearly. 
It fell neatly and precisely, turned, and then, like the other two, started slowly and purposefully to advance on Random. 
She stayed rooted to the spot. She still had her rock. Poised and ready to throw, but was increasingly conscious of the fact that the things she had it poised and ready to throw at were squirrels. Or at least, squirrel-like things. Soft, warm, cuddly squirrel-like things advancing on her in a way she wasn't at all certain she liked. 
She shone her torch directly on the first of them. It was making aggressive, hectoring, screeching noises, and carrying in one of its little fists a small tattered piece of wet, pink rag. Random hefted her rock menacingly in her hand, but it made no impression at all on the squirrel advancing on her with its wet piece of rag. 
She backed away. She didn't know at all how to deal with this. If they had been vicious snarling slavering beasts with glistening fangs she would have pitched into them with a will, but squirrels behaving like this she couldn't quite handle. 
She backed away again. The second squirrel was starting to make a flanking manoeuvre round to her right. Carrying a cup. Some kind of acorn thing. The third was right behind it and making its own advance. What was it carrying? Some little scrap of soggy paper, Random thought. 
She stepped back again, caught her ankle against the root of a tree and fell over backwards. 
Instantly the first squirrel darted forward and was on top of her, advancing along her stomach with cold purpose. In its eyes, and a piece of wet rag in its fist. 
Random tried to jump up, but only managed to jump about an inch. The startled movement of the squirrel on her stomach startled her in 
return. The squirrel froze, gripping her skin through her soaking shirt with its tiny claws. Then slowly, inch by inch, it made its way up her, stopped, and proffered her the rag. 
She felt almost hypnotised by the strangeness of the thing and its tiny glinting eyes. It proffered her the rag again. It pushed it at her repeatedly, screeching insistently, till at last, nervously, hesitantly, she took the thing from it. It continued to watch her intently, its eyes darting all over her face. She had no idea what to do. Rain and mud were streaming down her face and she had a squirrel sitting on her. She wiped some mud out of her eyes with the rag. 
The squirrel shrieked triumphantly, grabbed the rag back, leapt off her, ran scampering into the dark, enclosing night, darted up into a tree, dived into a hole in the trunk, settled back and lit a cigarette. 
Meanwhile Random was trying to fend off the squirrel with the acorn cup full of rain and the one with the paper. She shuffled backwards on her bottom. 
"No!" she shouted. "Go away!" 
They darted back, in fright, and then darted right forward again with their gifts. She brandished her rock at them. "Go!" she yelled. 
The squirrels scampered round in consternation. Then one darted straight at her, dropped the acorn cup in her lap, turned and ran off into the night. The other stood quivering for a moment, then put its scrap of paper neatly down in front of her and disappeared as well. 
She was alone again, but trembling with confusion. She got unsteadily to her feet, picked up her rock and her parcel, then paused and picked up the scrap of paper as well. It was so soggy and dilapidated it was hard to make out what it was. It seemed just to be a fragment of an in-flight magazine. 
Just as Random was trying to understand exactly what it was that this all meant, a man walked out into the clearing in which she was standing, raised a vicious-looking gun and shot her. 
Arthur was thrashing around hopelessly two or three miles behind her, on the upward side of the hill. 
Within minutes of setting out he had gone back again and equipped himself with a lamp. Not an electric one. The only electric light in the place was the one that Random had brought with her. This 
was a kind of dim hurricane lamp: a perforated metal canister from Strinder's forge, which contained a reservoir of inflammable fish oil, a wick of knotted dried grass and was wrapped in a translucent film made from dried membranes from the gut of a Perfectly Normal Beast. 
It had now gone out. 
Arthur jiggled around with it in a thoroughly pointless kind of a way for a few seconds. There was clearly no way he was going to get the thing suddenly to burst into flame again in the middle of a rainstorm, but it's impossible not to make a token effort. Reluctantly he threw the thing aside. 
What to do? This was hopeless. He was absolutely sodden, his clothes heavy and billowing with the rain, and now he was lost in the dark as well. 
For a brief second he was lost in the blinding light, and then he was lost in the dark again. 
The sheet of lightning had at least shown him that he was very close to the brow of the hill. Once he had breasted that he would... well, he wasn't certain what he would do. He'd have to work that out when he got there. 
He limped forward and upwards. 
A few minutes later he knew that he was standing panting at the top. There was some kind of dim glow in the distance below him. He had no idea what it was, and indeed he hardly liked to think. It was the only thing he had to make towards, though, so he started to make his way, stumbling, lost and frightened towards it. 
The flash of lethal light passed straight through Random and, about two seconds later, so did the man who had shot it. Other than that he paid her no attention whatsoever. He had shot someone standing behind her, and when she turned to look, he was kneeling over the body and going through its pockets. 
The tableau froze and vanished. It was replaced a second later by a giant pair of teeth framed by immense and perfectly glossed red lips. A huge blue brush appeared out of nowhere and started foamily to scrub at the teeth, which continued to hang there gleaming in the shimmering curtain of rain. 
Random blinked at it twice before she got it. 
It was a commercial. The guy who had shot her was part of a holographic in-flight movie. She must now be very close to where the ship had crashed. Obviously some of its systems were more indestructible than others. 
The next half-mile of the journey was particularly troublesome. Not only did she have the cold and the rain and the night to contend with, but also the fractured and thrashing remains of the ship's on-board entertainment system. Spaceships and jetcars and helipods crashed and exploded continuously around her, illuminating the night, villainous people in strange hats smuggled dangerous drugs through her, and the combined orchestra and chorus of the Hallapolis State Opera performed the closing March of the AnjaQantine Star Guard from Act IV of Rizgar's Blamwellamum of Woont in a little glade somewhere off to her left. 
And then she was standing on the lip of a very nasty looking and bubbly-edged crater. There was still a faint warm glow coming from what would otherwise have looked like an enormous piece of caramelised chewing gum in the centre of the pit: the melted remains of a great spaceship. 
She stood looking at it for a longish while, and then at last started to walk along and around the edge of the crater. She was no longer certain what she was looking for, but kept moving anyway, keeping the horror of the pit to her left. 
The rain was beginning to ease off a little, but it was still extremely wet, and since she didn't know what it was that was in the box, whether it was perhaps something delicate or damageable, she thought she ought to find somewhere reasonably dry to open it. She hoped she hadn't already damaged it by dropping it. 
She played her torch around the surrounding trees, which were thin on the ground here, and mostly charred and broken. In the middle distance she thought she could see a jumbled outcrop of rock which might provide some shelter, and she started to pick her way towards it. All around she found the detritus that had been ejected from the ship as it broke up, before the final fireball. 
After she had moved two or three hundred yards from the edge of the crater she came across the tattered fragments of some fluffy pink material, sodden, muddied and drooping amongst the broken trees. 
She guessed, correctly, that this must be the remains of the escape cocoon that had saved her father's life. She went and looked at it more closely, and then noticed something close to it on the ground, half covered in mud. 
She picked it up and wiped the mud off it. It was some kind of electronic device the size of a small book. Feebly glowing on its cover, in response to her touch, were some large friendly letters. They said DON'T PANIC. She knew what this was. It was her father's copy of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. 
She felt instantly reassured by it, turned her head up to the thundery sky and let some. Rain wash over her face and into her mouth. 
She shook her head and hurried on towards the rocks. Clambering up and over them she almost immediately found the perfect thing. The mouth of a cave. She played her torch into its interior. It seemed to be dry and safe. Picking her way carefully, she walked in. It was quite spacious, but didn't go that deep. Exhausted and relieved she sat on a convenient rock, put the box down in front of her and started immediately to open it. 
Chapter 17 
For a long period of time there was much speculation and controversy about where the so-called "missing matter" of the Universe had got to. All over the Galaxy the science departments of all the major universities were acquiring more and more elaborate equipment to probe and search the hearts of distant galaxies, and then the very centre and the very edges of the whole Universe, but when eventually it was tracked down it turned out in fact to be all the stuff which the equipment had been packed in. 
There was quite a large quantity of missing matter in the box, little soft round white pellets of missing matter, which Random discarded for future generations of physicists to track down and discover all over again once the findings of the current generation of physicists had been lost and forgotten about. 
Out of the pellets of missing matter she lifted the featureless black disk. She put it down on a rock beside her and sifted amongst all the missing matter to see if there was anything else, a manual or some attachments or something, but there was nothing else at all. Just the black disk. 
She shone the torch on it. 
As she did so, cracks began to appear along its apparently featureless surface. Random backed away nervously, but then saw that the thing, whatever it was, was merely unfolding itself. 
The process was wonderfully beautiful. It was extraordinarily elaborate but also simple and elegant. It was like a piece of self- opening origami, or a rosebud blooming into a rose in just a few seconds. 
Where just a few moments earlier there had been a smoothly curved black disk there was now a bird. A bird, hovering there. 
Random continued to back away from it, carefully and watchfully. 
It was a little like a pikka bird, only rather smaller. That is to say, in fact it was larger, or to be more exact, precisely the same size or, at 
least, not less than twice the size. It was also both a lot bluer and a lot pinker than pikka birds, while at the same time being perfectly black. 
There was also something very odd about it, which Random couldn't immediately make out. 
It certainly shared with pikka birds the impression it gave that it was watching something that you couldn't see. 
Suddenly it vanished. 
Then, just as suddenly everything went black. Random dropped into a tense crouch, feeling for the specially sharpened rock in her pocket again. Then the blackness receded and rolled itself up into a ball and then the blackness was the bird again. It hung in the air in front of her, beating its wings slowly and staring at her. 
"Excuse me," it said suddenly, "I just have to calibrate myself. Can you hear me when I say this?" 
"When you say what?" demanded Random. 
"Good," said the bird. "And can you hear me when I say this?" It spoke this time at a much higher pitch. 
"Yes, of course I can!" said Random. 
"And can you hear me when I say this?" it said, this time in a sepulchrally deep voice. 
"Yes!" 
There was then a pause. 
"No obviously not," said the bird after a few seconds. "Good, well your hearing range is obviously between 20 and 16 KHz. So. Is this comfortable for you?" it said in a pleasant light tenor. "No uncomfortable harmonics screeching away in the upper register? Obviously not. Good. I can use those as data channels. Now. How many of me can you see?" 
Suddenly the air was full of nothing but interlocking birds. Random was well used to spending time in virtual realities, but this was something far weirder than anything she had previously encountered. It was as if the whole geometry of space was redefined in seamless bird shapes. 
Random gasped and flung her arms round her face, her arms moving through bird-shaped space. 
"Hmmm, obviously way too many," said the bird. "How about now?" 
It concertinaed into a tunnel of birds, as if it was a bird caught between parallel mirrors, reflecting infinitely into the distance. 
"What are you?" shouted Random. 
"We'll come to that in a minute," said the bird. "Just how many, please?" 
"Well, you're sort of..." Random gestured helplessly off into the distance. 
"I see, still infinite in extent, but at least we're homing in on the right dimensional matrix. Good. No, the answer is an orange and two lemons." 
"Lemons?" 
"If I have three lemons and three oranges and I lose two oranges and a lemon what do I have left?" 
"Huh?" 
"OK, so you think that time flows that way, do you? Interesting. Am I still infinite?" it asked, ballooning this way and that in space. "Am I infinite now? How yellow am I?" 
Moment by moment the bird was going through mind-mangling transformations of shape and extent. 
"I can't..." said Random bewildered. 
"You don't have to answer, I can tell from watching you now. So. Am I your mother? Am I a rock? Do I seem huge, squishy and sinuously intertwined? No? How about now? Am I going backwards?" 
For once the bird was perfectly still and steady. 
"No," said Random. 
"Well I was in fact, I was moving backwards in time. Hmmm. Well I think we've sorted all that out now. If you'd like to know, I can tell you that in your universe you move freely in three dimensions that you call space. You move in a straight line in a fourth, which you call time, and stay rooted to one place in a fifth, which is the first fundamental of probability. After that it gets a hit complicated, and there's all sorts of stuff going on in dimensions 13 to 22 that you really wouldn't want to know about. All you really need to know for the moment is that the universe is a lot more complicated than you might think, even if you 
start from a position of thinking it's pretty damn complicated in the first place. I can easily not say words like 'damn' if it offends you." 
"Say what you damn well like."â¨"I will."â¨"What the hell are you?" demanded Random. 
"I am The Guide. In your universe I am your Guide. In fact I inhabit what is technically known as the Whole Sort of General Mish Mash which means... well, let me show you." 
It turned in mid-air and swooped out of the cave, and then perched on a rock, just beneath an overhang, out of the rain, which was getting heavier again. 
"Come on," it said, "watch this." 
Random didn't like being bossed around by a bird, but she followed it to the mouth of the cave anyway, still fingering the rock in her pocket. 
"Rain," said the bird. "You see? Just rain." 
"I know what rain is." 
Sheets of the stuff were sweeping through the night, moonlight sifting through it. 
"So what is it?" 
"What do you mean, what is it? Look, who are you? What were you doing in that box? Why have I spent a night running through the forest fending off demented squirrels to find that all I've got at the end of it is a bird asking me what rain is. It's just water falling through the bloody air, that's what it is. Anything else you want to know or can we go home now?" 
There was a long pause before the bird answered, "You want to go home?" 
"I haven't got a home!" Random almost shocked herself, she screamed the words so loudly. 
"Look into the rain..." said the bird Guide. 
"I'm looking into the rain! What else is there to look at?" 
"What do you see?" 
"What do you mean, you stupid bird? I just see a load of rain. It's just water, falling." 
"What shapes do you see in the water?" 
"Shapes? There aren't any shapes. It's just, just..." "Just a mish mash," said the bird Guide.â¨"Yes..."â¨"Now what do you see?" 
Just on the very edge of visibility a thin faint beam fanned out of the bird's eyes. In the dry air beneath the overhang there was nothing to see. Where the beam hit the drops of rain as they fell through it, there was a flat sheet of light, so bright and vivid it seemed solid. 
"Oh great. A laser show," said Random fractiously. "Never seen one of those before, of course, except at about five million rock concerts." 
"Tell me what you see!" 
"Just a flat sheet! Stupid bird." 
"There's nothing there that wasn't there before. I'm just using light to draw your attention to certain drops at certain moments. Now what do you see?" 
The light shut off. 
"Nothing." 
"I'm doing exactly the same thing, but with ultra-violet light. You can't see it." 
"So what's the point of showing me something I can't see?" 
"So that you understand that just because you see something, it doesn't mean to say it's there. And if you don't see something it doesn't mean to say it's not there, it's only what your senses bring to your attention." 
"I'm bored with this," said Random, and then gasped. 
Hanging in the rain was a giant and very vivid three-dimensional image of her father looking startled about something. 
About two miles away behind Random, her father, struggling his way through the woods suddenly stopped. He was startled to see an image of himself looking startled about something hanging brightly in the rain-filled air about two miles away. About two miles away some distance to the right of the direction in which he was heading. 
He was almost completely lost, convinced he was going to die of cold and wet and exhaustion and beginning to wish he could just get 
on with it. He had just been brought an entire golfing magazine by a squirrel, as well, and his brain, was beginning to howl and gibber. 
Seeing a huge bright image of himself light up in the sky told him that, on balance, he was probably right to howl and gibber but probably wrong as far as the direction he was heading was concerned. 
Taking a deep breath, he turned and headed off towards the inexplicable light show. 
"OK, so what's that supposed to prove?" demanded Random. It was the fact that the image was her father that had startled her rather than the appearance of the image itself. She had seen her first hologram when she was two months old and had been put in it to play. She had seen her most recent one about half an hour ago playing the March of the AnjaQantine Star Guard. 
"Only that it's no more there or not there than the sheet was," said the bird. "It's just the interaction of water from the sky moving in one direction, with light at frequencies your senses can detect moving in another. It makes an apparently solid image in your mind. But it's all just images in the Mish Mash. Here's another one for you." 
"My mother!" said Random.â¨"No," said the bird.â¨"I know my mother when I see her!" 
The image was of a woman emerging from a spacecraft inside a large, grey hangar-like building. She was being escorted by a group of tall, thin purplish-green creatures. It was definitely Random's mother. Well, almost definitely. Trillian wouldn't have been walking quite so uncertainly in low gravity, or looking around her at a boring old life- support environment with quite such a disbelieving look on her face, or carrying such a quaint old camera. 
"So who is it?" demanded Random. 
"She is part of the extent of your mother on the probability axis," said the bird Guide. 
"I haven't the faintest idea what you mean." 
"Space, time and probability all have axes along which it is possible to move." 
"Still dunno. Though I think... No. Explain." 
"I thought you wanted to go home." "Explain!"â¨"Would you like to see your home?" "See it? It was destroyed!" 
"It is discontinuous along the probability axis. Look!" 
Something very strange and wonderful now swam into view in the rain. It was a huge, bluish-greenish globe, misty and cloud-covered, turning with. majestic slowness against a black, starry background. 
"Now you see it," said the bird. "Now you don't." 
A little less than two miles away, now, Arthur Dent stood still in his tracks. He could not believe what he could see, hanging there, shrouded in rain, but brilliant and vividly real against the night sky the Earth. He gasped at the sight of it. Then, at the moment he gasped, it disappeared again. Then it appeared again. Then, and this was the bit that made him give up and stick straws in his hair, it turned into a sausage. 
*** 
Random was also startled by the sight of this huge, blue and green and watery and misty sausage hanging above her. And now it was a string of sausages, or rather it was a string of sausages in which many of the sausages were missing. The whole brilliant string turned and span in a bewildering dance in the air and then gradually slowed, grew insubstantial and faded into the glistening darkness of the night. 
"What was that?" asked Random, in a small voice. 
"A glimpse along the probability axis of a discontinuously probable object." 
"I see." 
"Most objects mutate and change along their axis of probability, but the world of your origin does something slightly different. It lies on what you might call a fault line in the landscape of probability which means that at many probability co-ordinates, the whole of it simply ceases to exist. It has an inherent instability, which is typical of anything that lies within what are usually designated the Plural sectors. Make sense?" 
"No." 
"Want to go and see for yourself?" "To... Earth?"â¨"Yes."â¨"Is that possible?" 
The bird Guide did not answer at once. It spread its wings and, with an easy grace, ascended into the air and flew out into the rain which, once again, was beginning to lighten. 
It soared ecstatically up into the night sky, lights flashed around it, dimensions dithered in its wake. It swooped and turned and looped and turned again and came at last to rest two feet in front of Random's face, its wings beating slowly and silently. 
It spoke to her again. 
"Your universe is vast to you. Vast in time, vast in space. That's because of the filters through which you perceive it. But I was built with no filters at all, which means I perceive the mish mash which contains all possible universes but which has, itself, no size at all. For me, anything is possible. I am omniscient and omnipotent, extremely vain, and, what is more, I come in a handy self-carrying package. You have to work out how much of the above is true." 
A slow smile spread over Random's face. 
"You bloody little thing. You've been winding me up!" 
"As I said, anything is possible." 
Random laughed. "OK," she said. "Let's try and go to Earth. Let's go to Earth at some point on its, er..." 
"Probability axis?" 
"Yes. Where it hasn't been blown up. OK. So you're the Guide. How do we get a lift?" 
"Reverse engineering." 
"What?" 
"Reverse engineering. To me the flow of time is irrelevant. You decide what you want. I then merely make sure that it has already happened." 
"You're joking."â¨"Anything is possible."â¨Random frowned. "You are joking aren't you?" 
"Let me put it another way," said the bird. "Reverse engineering enables us to shortcut all the business of waiting for one of the horribly few spaceships that passes through your galactic sector every year or so to make up its mind about whether or not it feels like giving you a lift. You want a lift a ship arrives and gives you one. The pilot may think he has any one of a million reasons why he has decided to stop and pick you up. The real reason is that I have determined that he will." 
"This is you being extremely vain isn't it, little bird?" The bird was silent.â¨"OK," said Random. "I want a ship to take me to Earth." "Will this one do?" 
It was so silent that Random had not noticed the descending spaceship until it was nearly on top of her. 
Arthur had noticed it. He was a mile away now and closing. Just after the illuminated sausage display had drawn to its conclusion he had noticed the faint glimmerings of further lights coming down out of the clouds and had, to begin with, assumed it to be another piece of flashy son et lumiÃ¨re. 
It took a moment or so for it to dawn on him that it was an actual spaceship, and a moment or two longer for him to realise that it was dropping directly down to where he assumed his daughter to be. That was when, rain or no rain, leg injury or no leg injury, darkness or no darkness, he suddenly started really to run. 
He fell almost immediately, slid and hurt his knee quite badly on a rock. He slithered back up to his feet and tried again. He had a horrible cold feeling that he was about to lose Random for ever. Limping and cursing, he ran. He didn't know what it was that had been in the box, but the name on it had been Ford Prefect, and that was the name he cursed as he ran. 
The ship was one of the sexiest and most beautiful ones that Random had ever seen. 
It was astounding. Silver, sleek, ineffable. 
If she didn't know better she would have said it was an RW6. As it settled silently beside her she realised that it actually was an RW6 and 
she could scarcely breathe for excitement. An RW6 was the sort of thing you only saw in the sort of magazines that were designed to provoke civil unrest. 
She was also extremely nervous. The manner and timing of its arrival was deeply unsettling. Either it was the most bizarre coincidence or something very peculiar and worrying was going on. She waited a little tensely for the ship's hatch to open. Her Guide she thought of it as hers now was hovering lightly over her right shoulder, its wings barely fluttering. 
The hatch opened. Just a little dim light escaped. A moment or two passed and a figure emerged. He stood still for a moment or so, obviously trying to accustom his eyes to the darkness. Then he caught sight of Random standing there, and seemed a little surprised. He started to walk towards her. Then suddenly he shouted in surprise and started to run at her. 
Random was not a good person to take a run at on a dark night when she was feeling a little strung out. She had unconsciously been fingering the rock in her pocket from the moment she saw the craft coming down. 
Still running, slithering, hurtling, bumping into trees, Arthur saw at last that he was too late. The ship had only been on the ground for about three minutes, and now, silently, gracefully it was rising up above the trees again, turning smoothly in the fine speckle of rain to which the storm had now abated, climbing, climbing, tipping up its nose and, suddenly, effortlessly, hurtling up through the clouds. 
Gone. Random was in it. It was impossible for Arthur to know this, but he just went ahead and knew it anyway. She was gone. He had had his stint at being a parent and could scarcely believe how badly he had done at it. He tried to continue running, but his feet were dragging, his knee was hurting like fury and he knew that he was too late. 
He could not conceive that he could feel more wretched and awful than this, but he was wrong. 
He limped his way at last to the cave where Random had sheltered and opened the box. The ground bore the indentations of the spacecraft that had landed there only minutes before, but of Random there was no sign. He wandered disconsolately into the cave, found 
the empty box and piles of missing matter pellets strewn around the place. He felt a little cross about that. He'd tried to teach her about cleaning up after herself. Feeling a bit cross with her about something like that helped him feel less desolate about her leaving. He knew he had no means of finding her. 
His foot knocked against something unexpected. He bent down to pick it up, and was thoroughly surprised to discover what it was. It was his old Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. How did that come to be in the cave? He had never returned to collect it from the scene of the crash. He had not wanted to revisit the crash and he had not wanted the Guide again. He had reckoned he was here on Lamuella, making sandwiches for good. How did it come to be in the cave? It was active. The words on the cover flashed DON'T PANIC at him. 
He went out of the cave again into the dim and damp moonlight. He sat on a rock to have a look through the old Guide, and then discovered it wasn't a rock, it was a person. 
Chapter 18 
Arthur leapt to his feet with a start of fear. It would be hard to say which he was more frightened of: that he might have hurt the person he had inadvertently sat on or that the person he had inadvertently sat on would hurt him back. 
There seemed, on inspection, to be little immediate cause for alarm on the second count. Whoever it was he had sat on was unconscious. That would probably go a great deal of the way towards explaining what he was doing lying there. He seemed to be breathing OK, though. Arthur felt his pulse. That was OK as well. 
He was lying on his side, half curled up. It was so long ago and far away when Arthur had last done First Aid that he really couldn't remember what it was he was supposed to do. The first thing he was supposed to do, he remembered, was to have a First Aid kit about his person. Damn. 
Should he roll him on to his back or not? Suppose he had any broken bones? Suppose he swallowed his tongue? Suppose he sued him? Who, apart from anything else, was he? 
At that moment the unconscious man groaned loudly and rolled himself over. 
Arthur wondered if he should. 
He looked at him. 
He looked at him again. 
He looked at him again, just to make absolutely sure. 
Despite the fact that he had been thinking he was feeling about as low as he possibly could, he experienced a terrible sinking feeling. 
The figure groaned again and slowly opened his eyes. It took him a while to focus, then he blinked and stiffened. 
"You!" said Ford Prefect. "You!" said Arthur Dent. Ford groaned again. 
"What do you need to have explained this time?" he said, and closed his eyes in some kind of despair. 
*** 
Five minutes later he was sitting up and rubbing the side of his head, where he had quite a large swelling. 
"Who the hell was that woman?" he said. "Why are we surrounded by squirrels, and what do they want?" 
"I've been pestered by squirrels all night," said Arthur. "They keep on trying to give me magazines and stuff." 
Ford frowned. "Really?" he said.â¨"And bits of rag."â¨Ford thought.â¨"Oh," he said. "Is this near where your ship crashed?" "Yes," said Arthur. He said it a little tightly. 
"That's probably it. Can happen. Ship's cabin robots get destroyed. The cyberminds that control them survive and start infesting the local wildlife. Can turn a whole ecosystem into some kind of helpless thrashing service industry, handing out hot towels and drinks to passers-by. Should be a law against it. Probably is. Probably also a law against there being a law against it so everybody can get nice and worked up. Hey ho. What did you say?" 
"I said, and the woman is my daughter."â¨Ford stopped rubbing his head.â¨"Say that one more time."â¨"I said," said Arthur huffily, "the woman is my daughter." "I didn't know," said Ford, "that you had a daughter." 
"Well, there's probably a lot you don't know about me," said Arthur. "Come to mention it, there's probably a lot I don't know about me either." 
"Well, well, well. When did this happen then?" 
"I'm not quite sure." 
"That sounds like more familiar territory," said Ford. "Is there a mother involved?" 
"Trillian."â¨"Trillian? I didn't think that..." 
"No. Look, it's a bit embarrassing." 
"I remember she told me once she had a kid but only, sort of, in passing. I'm in touch with her from time to time. Never seen her with the kid." 
Arthur said nothing. 
Ford started to feel the side of his head again in some bemusement. 
"Are you sure this was your daughter?" he said. 
"Tell me what happened." 
"Phroo. Long story. I was coming to pick up this parcel I'd sent to myself here care of you..." 
"Well, what was that all about?"â¨"I think it may be something unimaginably dangerous." "And you sent it to me?" protested Arthur. 
"Safest place I could think of. I thought I could rely on you to be absolutely boring and not open it. Anyway, coming in at night I couldn't find this village place. I was going by pretty basic information. I couldn't find any signal of any kind. I guess you don't have signals and stuff here." 
"That's what I like about it." 
"Then I did pick up a faint signal from your old copy of the Guide, so I homed in on that, thinking that would take me to you. I found I'd landed in some kind of wood. Couldn't figure out what was going on. I get out, and then see this woman standing there. I go up to say hello, then suddenly I see that she's got this thing!" 
"What thing?" 
"The thing I sent you! The new Guide! The bird thing! You were meant to keep it safe, you idiot, but this woman had the thing right there by her shoulder. I ran forward and she hit me with a rock." 
"I see," said Arthur. "What did you do?" 
"Well, I fell over of course. I was very badly hurt. She and the bird started to make off towards my ship. And when I say my ship, I mean an RW6." 
"A what?" 
"An RW6 for Zark's sake. I've got this great relationship going now between my credit card and the Guide's central computer. You would not believe that ship, Arthur, it's..." 
"So an RW6 is a spaceship, then?" 
"Yes! It's oh never mind. Look, just get some kind of grip will you, Arthur? Or at least get some kind of catalogue. At this point I was very worried. And, I think, semi-concussed. I was down on my knees and bleeding profusely, so I did the only thing I could think of, which was to beg. I said, please for Zark's sake don't take my ship. And don't leave me stranded in the middle of some primitive zarking forest with no medical help and a head injury. I could be in serious trouble and so could she." 
"What did she say?"â¨"She hit me on the head with the rock again."â¨"I think I can confirm that that was my daughter."â¨"Sweet kid."â¨"You have to get to know her," said Arthur.â¨"She eases up does she?"â¨"No," said Arthur, "but you get a better sense of when to duck." Ford held his head and tried to see straight. 
The sky was beginning to lighten in the west, which was where the sun rose. Arthur didn't particularly want to see it. The last thing he wanted after a hellish night like this one was some blasted day coming along and barging about the place. 
"What are you doing in a place like this, Arthur?" demanded Ford. "Well," said Arthur, "making sandwiches mostly."â¨"What?" 
"I am, probably was, the sandwich maker for a small tribe. It was a bit embarrassing really. When I first arrived, that is, when they rescued me from the wreckage of this super high-technology spacecraft which had crashed on their planet, they were very nice to me and I thought I should help them out a bit. You know, I'm an educated chap from a high-technology culture, I could show them a thing or two. And of course I couldn't. I haven't got the faintest idea, when it comes down to it, of how anything actually works. I don't mean like video-recorders, nobody knows how to work those. I mean just something like a pen or an artesian well or something. Not the foggiest. I couldn't help at all. One day I got glum and made myself a sandwich. That suddenly got them all excited. They'd never seen one before. It was just an idea that had never occurred to them, and I 
happen to quite like making sandwiches, so it all sort of developed from there." 
"And you enjoyed that?" 
"Well, yes, I think I sort of did, really. Getting a good set of knives, that sort of thing." 
"You didn't, for instance, find it mind-witheringly, explosively, astoundingly, blisteringly dull?" 
"Well, er, no. Not as such. Not actually blisteringly." "Odd. I would."â¨"Well, I suppose we have a different outlook." "Yes." 
"Like the pikka birds." 
Ford had no idea what he was talking about and couldn't be bothered to ask. Instead he said, "So how the hell do we get out of this place?" 
"Well I think the simplest way from here is just to follow the way down the valley to the plains, probably take an hour, and then walk round from there. I don't think I could face going back up and over the way I came." 
"Walk round where from there?" 
"Well, back to the village. I suppose." Arthur sighed a little forlornly. 
"I don't want to go to any blasted village!" snapped Ford. 
"We've got to get out of here!" 
"Where? How?" 
"I don't know, you tell me. You live here! There must be some way off this zarking planet." 
"I don't know. What do you usually do? Sit around and wait for a passing spacecraft, I suppose." 
"Oh yes? And how many spacecraft have visited this zark-forsaken little fleapit recently?" 
"Well, a few years ago there was mine that crashed here by mistake. Then there was, er, Trillian, then the parcel delivery, and now you, and..." 
"Yes, but apart from the usual suspects?" 
"Well, er, I think pretty much none, so far as I know. Pretty quiet round here." 
As if deliberately to prove him wrong, there was a long, low distant roll of thunder. 
Ford leapt to his feet fretfully and started pacing backwards and forwards in the feeble, painful light of the early dawn which lay streaked against the sky as if someone had dragged a piece of liver across it. 
"You don't understand how important this is," he said. 
"What? You mean my daughter out there all alone in the Galaxy? You think I don't..." 
"Can we feel sorry for the Galaxy later?" said Ford. "This is very, very serious indeed. The Guide has been taken over. It's been bought out." 
Arthur leapt up. "Oh very serious," he shouted. "Please fill me in straight away on some corporate publishing politics! I can't tell you how much it's been on my mind of late!" 
"You don't understand! There's a whole new Guide!" 
"Oh!" shouted Arthur again. "Oh! Oh! Oh! I'm incoherent with excitement! I can hardly wait for it to come out to find out which are the most exciting spaceports to get bored hanging about in some globular cluster I've never heard of. Please, can we rush to a store that's got it right this very instant?" 
Ford narrowed his eyes. 
"This is that thing you call sarcasm, isn't it?" 
"Do you know," bellowed Arthur, "I think it is? I really think it might just be a crazy little thing called sarcasm seeping in at the edges of my manner of speech! Ford, I have had a fucking bad night! Will you please try and take that into account while you consider what fascinating bits of badger-sputumly inconsequential trivia to assail me with next?" 
"Try to rest," said Ford. "I need to think." 
"Why do you need to think? Can't we just sit and go budum- budumbudum with our lips for a bit? Couldn't we just dribble gently and loll a little bit to the left for a few minutes? I can't stand it, Ford! I can't stand all this thinking and trying to work things out any more. You may think that I am just standing here barking..." 
"Hadn't occurred to me in fact." 
"...but I mean it! What is the point? We assume that every time we do anything we know what the consequences will be, i.e., more or less what we intend them to be. This is not only not always correct. It is wildly, crazily, stupidly cross-eyed-blithering-insectly wrong!" 
"Which is exactly my point." 
"Thank you," said Arthur, sitting down again. "What?" 
"Temporal reverse engineering." 
Arthur put his head in his hands and shook it gently from side to side. 
"Is there any humane way," he moaned, "in which I can prevent you from telling me what temporary reverse bloody-whatsiting is?" 
"No," said Ford, "because your daughter is caught up in the middle of it and it is deadly, deadly serious." 
Thunder rolled in the pause. 
"All right," said Arthur. "Tell me." 
"I leaped out of a high-rise office window." 
This cheered Arthur up. 
"Oh!" he said. "Why don't you do it again?" 
"I did." 
"Hmmm," said Arthur, disappointed. "Obviously no good came of it." 
"The first time I managed to save myself by the most astonishing and I say this in all modesty fabulous piece of ingenious quick- thinking, agility, fancy footwork and self-sacrifice." 
"What was the self-sacrifice?" 
"I jettisoned half of a much loved and I think irreplaceable pair of shoes." 
"Why was that self-sacrifice?"â¨"Because they were mine!" said Ford crossly. "I think we have different value systems." "Well mine's better." 
"That's according to your... oh never mind. So having saved yourself very cleverly once you very sensibly went and jumped again. Please don't tell me why. Just tell me what happened if you must." 
"I fell straight into the open cockpit of a passing jet towncar whose pilot had just accidentally pushed the eject button when he meant only to change tracks on the stereo. Now, even I couldn't think that that was particularly clever of me." 
"Oh, I don't know," said Arthur wearily. "I expect you probably sneaked into his jetcar the previous night and set the pilot's least favourite track to play or something." 
"No, I didn't," said Ford. 
"Just checking." 
"Though oddly enough, somebody else did. And this is the nub. You could trace the chain and branches of crucial events and coincidences back and back. Turned out the new Guide had done it. That bird." 
"What bird?" 
"You haven't seen it?" 
"No." 
"Oh. It's a lethal little thing. Looks pretty, talks big, collapses waveforms selectively at will." 
"What does that mean?" 
"Temporal reverse engineering." 
"Oh," said Arthur. "Oh yes." 
"The question is, who is it really doing it for?" 
"I've actually got a sandwich in my pocket," said Arthur, delving. "Would you like a bit?" 
"Yeah, OK." 
"It's a bit squished and sodden, I'm afraid." 
"Never mind." 
They munched for a bit. 
"It's quite good in fact," said Ford. "What's the meat in it?" 
"Perfectly Normal Beast." 
"Not come across that one. So, the question is," Ford continued, "who is the bird really doing it for? What's the real game here?" 
"Mmm," ate Arthur. 
"When I found the bird," continued Ford, "which I did by a series of coincidences that are interesting in themselves, it put on the most fantastic multi-dimensional display of pyrotechnics I've ever seen. It 
then said that it would put its services at my disposal in my universe. I said, thanks but no thanks. It said that it would anyway, whether I liked it or not. I said just try it, and it said it would and, indeed,â¨already had done. I said we'd see about that and it said that we would. That's when I decided to pack the thing up and get it out of there. So I sent it to you for safety." 
"Oh yes? Whose?" 
"Never you mind. Then, what with one thing and another, I thought it prudent to jump out of the window again, being fresh out of other options at the time. Luckily for me the jetcar was there otherwise I would have had to fall back on ingenious quick-thinking, agility, maybe another shoe or, failing all else, the ground. But it meant that, whether I liked it or not, the Guide was, well, working for me, and that was deeply worrying." 
"Why?" 
"Because if you've got the Guide you think that you are the one it's working for. Everything went swimmingly smoothly for me from then on, up to the very moment that I come up against the totty with the rock, then, bang, I'm history. I'm out of the loop." 
"Are you referring to my daughter?" 
"As politely as I can. She's the next one in the chain who will think that everything is going fabulously for her. She can beat whoever she likes around the head with bits of the landscape, everything will just swim for her until she's done whatever she's supposed to do and then it will be all up for her too. It's reverse temporal engineering, and clearly nobody understood what was being unleashed!" 
"Like me for instance." 
"What? Oh, wake up, Arthur. Look, let me try it again. The new Guide came out of the research labs. It made use of this new technology of Unfiltered Perception. Do you know what that means?" 
"Look, I've been making sandwiches for Bob's sake!" "Who's Bob?"â¨"Never mind. Just carry on." 
"Unfiltered Perception means it perceives everything. Got that? I don't perceive everything. You don't perceive everything. We have filters. The new Guide doesn't have any sense filters. It perceives 
everything. It wasn't a complicated technological idea. It was just a question of leaving a bit out. Got it?" 
"Why don't I just say that I've got it, and then you can carry on regardless." 
"Right. Now because the bird can perceive every possible Universe it is present in every possible universe. Yes?" 
"Y... e... e... s. Ish." 
"So what happens is, the bozos in the marketing and accounting departments say, oh that sounds good, doesn't that mean we only have to make one of them and then sell it an infinite number of times? Don't squint at me like that, Arthur, this is how accountants think!" 
"That's quite clever, isn't it?" 
"No! It is fantastically stupid. Look. The machine's only a little Guide. It's got some quite clever cybertechnology in it, but because it has Unfiltered Perception, any smallest move it makes has the power of a virus. It can propagate throughout space, time and a million other dimensions. Anything can be focused anywhere in any of the universes that you and I move in. Its power is recursive. Think of a computer program. Somewhere, there is one key instruction, and everything else is just functions calling themselves, or brackets billowing out endlessly through an infinite address space. What happens when the brackets collapse? Where's the final 'end if'? Is any of this making sense? Arthur?" 
"Sorry, I was nodding off for a moment. Something about the Universe, yes?" 
"Something about the Universe, yes," said Ford, wearily. He sat down again. 
"All right," he said. "Think about this. You know who I think I saw at the Guide offices? Vogons. Ah. I see I've said a word you understand at last." 
Arthur leapt to his feet. "That noise," he said. "What noise?"â¨"The thunder." 
"What about it?" 
"It isn't thunder. It's the spring migration of the Perfectly Normal Beasts. It's started." 
"What are these animals you keep on about?"â¨"I don't keep on about them. I just put bits of them in sandwiches." "Why are they called Perfectly Normal Beasts?"â¨Arthur told him. 
It wasn't often that Arthur had the pleasure of seeing Ford's eyes open wide with astonishment. 
Chapter 19 
It was a sight that Arthur never quite got used to, or tired of. He and Ford had tracked their way swiftly along the side of the small river that flowed down along the bed of the valley, and when at last they reached the margin of the plains they pulled themselves up into the branches of a large tree to get a better view of one of the stranger and more wonderful visions that the Galaxy has to offer. 
The great thunderous herd of thousand upon thousand of Perfectly Normal Beasts was sweeping in magnificent array across the Anhondo Plain. In the early pale light of the morning, as the great animals charged through the fine steam of the sweat of their bodies mingled with the muddy mist churned up by their pounding hooves, their appearance seemed a little unreal and ghostly anyway, but what was heart-stopping about them was where they came from and where they went to, which appeared to be, simply, nowhere. 
They formed a solid, charging phalanx roughly a hundred yards wide and half a mile long. The phalanx never moved, except that it exhibited a slight gradual drift sideways and backwards for the eight or nine days that it regularly appeared for. But though the phalanx stayed more or less constant, the great beasts of which it was composed charged steadily at upwards of twenty miles an hour, appearing suddenly from thin air at one end of the plain, and disappearing equally abruptly at the other end. 
No one knew where they came from, no one knew where they went. They were so important to the lives of the Lamuellans, it was almost as if nobody liked to ask. Old Thrashbarg had said on one occasion that some times if you received an answer, the question might be taken away. Some of the villagers had privately said that this was the only properly wise thing they'd ever heard Thrashbarg say, and after a short debate on the matter, had put it down to chance. 
The noise of the pounding of the hooves was so intense that it was hard to hear anything else above it. 
"What did you say?" shouted Arthur. 
"I said," shouted Ford, "this looks like it might be some kind of evidence of dimensional drift." 
"Which is what?" shouted Arthur back. 
"Well, a lot of people are beginning to worry that space/time is showing signs of cracking up with everything that's happening to it. There are quite a lot of worlds where you can see how the landmasses have cracked up and moved around just from the weirdly long or meandering routes that migrating animals take. This might be something like that. We live in twisted times. Still, in the absence of a decent spaceport..." 
Arthur looked at him in a kind of frozen way. 
"What do you mean?" he said. 
"What do you mean, what do I mean?" shouted Ford. "You know perfectly well what I mean. We're going to ride our way out of here." 
"Are you seriously suggesting we try to ride a Perfectly Normal Beast?" 
"Yeah. See where it goes to." 
"We'll be killed! No," said Arthur, suddenly. "We won't be killed. At least I won't. Ford, have you ever heard of a planet called Stavromula Beta?" 
Ford frowned. "Don't think so," he said. He pulled out his own battered old copy of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and accessed it. "Any funny spelling?" he said. 
"Don't know. I've only ever heard it said, and that was by someone who had a mouthful of other people's teeth. You remember I told you about Agrajag?" 
Ford thought for a moment. "You mean the guy who was convinced you were getting him killed over and over again?" 
"Yes. One of the places he claimed I'd got him killed was Stavromula Beta. Someone tries to shoot me, it seems. I duck and Agrajag, or at least, one of his many reincarnations, gets hit. It seems that this has definitely happened at some point in time so, I suppose, I can't get killed at least until after I've ducked on Stavromula Beta. Only no one's ever heard of it." 
"Hmm." Ford tried a few other searches of the Hitchhiker's Guide, but drew a blank. 
"Nothing," he said. 
"I was just... no, I've never heard of it," said Ford finally. He wondered why it was ringing a very, very faint bell, though. 
"OK," said Arthur. "I've seen the way the Lamuellan hunters trap Perfectly Normal Beasts. If you spear one in the herd it just gets trampled, so they have to lure them out one at a time for the kill. It's very like the way a matador works, you know, with a brightly coloured cape. You get one to charge at you and then step aside and execute a rather elegant swing through with the cape. Have you got anything like a brightly coloured cape about you?" 
"This do?" said Ford, handing him his towel. 
Chapter 20 
Leaping on to the back of a one-and-a-half-ton Perfectly Normal Beast migrating through your world at a thundering thirty miles an hour is not as easy as it might at first seem. Certainly it is not as easy as the Lamuellan hunters made it seem, and Arthur Dent was prepared to discover that this might turn out to be the difficult bit. 
What he hadn't been prepared to discover, however, was how difficult it was even getting to the difficult bit. It was the bit that was supposed to be the easy bit which turned out to be practically impossible. 
They couldn't even catch the attention of a single animal. The Perfectly Normal Beasts were so intent on working up a good thunder with their hooves, heads down shoulders forward, back legs pounding the ground into porridge that it would have taken something not merely startling but actually geological to disturb them. 
The sheer amount of thundering and pending was, in the end, more than Arthur and Ford could deal with. After they had spent nearly two hours prancing about doing increasingly foolish things with a medium-sized floral patterned bath towel, they had not managed to get even one of the great beasts thundering and pounding past them to do so much as glance casually in their direction. 
They were within three feet of the horizontal avalanche of sweating bodies. To have been much nearer would have been to risk instant death, chronologic or no chronologic. Arthur had seen what remained of any Perfectly Normal Beast which, as the result of a clumsy misthrow by a young and inexperienced Lamuellan hunter, got speared while still thundering and pounding with the herd. 
One stumble was all it took. No prior appointment with death on Stavromula Beta, wherever the hell Stavromula Beta was, would save you or anybody else from the thunderous, mangling pounding of those hooves. 
At last, Arthur and Ford staggered back. They sat down, exhausted and defeated, and started to criticise each other's technique with the towel. 
"You've got to flick it more," complained Ford. "You need more follow-through from the elbow if you're going to get those blasted creatures to notice anything at all." 
"Follow-through?" protested Arthur. "You need more suppleness in the wrist." 
"You need more after-flourish," countered Ford. "You need a bigger towel."â¨"You need," said another voice, "a pikka bird." "You what?" 
The voice had come from behind them. They turned, and there, standing behind them in the early morning sun, was Old Thrashbarg. 
"To attract the attention of a Perfectly Normal Beast," he said, as he walked forward towards them, "you need a pikka bird. Like this." 
From under the rough, cassocky robe-like thing he wore he drew a small pikka bird. It sat restlessly on Old Thrashbarg's hand and peered intently at Bob knows what darting around about three feet six inches in front of it. 
Ford instantly went into the sort of alert crouch he liked to do when he wasn't quite sure what was going on or what he ought to do about it. He waved his arms around very slowly in what he hoped was an ominous manner. 
"Who is this?" he hissed. 
"It's just Old Thrashbarg," said Arthur quietly. "And I wouldn't bother with all the fancy movements. He's just as experienced a bluffer as you are. You could end up dancing around each other all day." 
"The bird," hissed Ford again. "What's the bird?" 
"It's just a bird!" said Arthur impatiently. "It's like any other bird. It lays eggs and goes ark at things you can't see. Or kar or rit or something." 
"Have you seen one lay eggs?" said Ford, suspiciously. 
"For heaven's sake of course I have," said Arthur. "And I've eaten hundreds of them. Make rather a good omelette. The secret is little cubes of cold butter and then whipping it lightly with..." 
"I don't want a zarking recipe," said Ford. "I just want to be sure it's a real bird and not some kind of multi-dimensional cybernightmare." 
He slowly stood up from his crouched position and started to brush himself down. He was still watching the bird, though. 
"So," said Old Thrashbarg to Arthur. "Is it written that Bob shall once more take back unto himself the benediction of his once-given sandwich maker?" 
Ford almost went back into his crouch. 
"It's all right," muttered Arthur, "he always talks like that." Aloud, he said, "Ah, venerable Thrashbarg. Um, yes. I'm afraid I think I'm going to have to be popping off now. But young Drimple, my apprentice, will be a fine sandwich maker in my stead. He has the aptitude, a deep love of sandwiches, and the skills he has acquired so far, though rudimentary as yet, will, in time mature and, er, well, I think he'll work out OK is what I'm trying to say." 
Old Thrashbarg regarded him gravely. His old grey eyes moved sadly. He held his arms aloft, one still carrying a bobbing pikka bird, the other his staff. 
"O Sandwich Maker from Bob!" he pronounced. He paused, furrowed his brow, and sighed as he closed his eyes in pious contemplation. "Life," he said, "will be a very great deal less weird without you!" 
Arthur was stunned. 
"Do you know," he said, "I think that's the nicest thing anybody's ever said to me?" 
"Can we get on, please?" said Ford. 
Something was already happening. The presence of the pikka bird at the end of Thrashbarg's outstretched arm was sending tremors of interest through the thundering herd. The odd head flicked momentarily in their direction. Arthur began to remember some of the Perfectly Normal Beast hunts he had witnessed. He recalled that as well as the hunter-matadors brandishing their capes there were always others standing behind them holding pikka birds. He had always assumed that, like him, they had just come along to watch. 
Old Thrashbarg moved forward, a little closer to the rolling herd. Some of the Beasts were now tossing their heads back with interest at the sight of the pikka bird. 
Old Thrashbarg's outstretched arms were trembling. 
Only the pikka bird itself seemed to show no interest in what was going on. A few anonymous molecules of air nowhere in particular engaged all of its perky attention. 
"Now!" exclaimed Old Thrashbarg at last. "Now you may work them with the towel!" 
Arthur advanced with Ford's towel, moving the way the hunter- matadors did, with a kind of elegant strut that did not come at all naturally to him. But now he knew what to do and that it was right. He brandished and flicked the towel a few times, to be ready for the moment, and then he watched. 
Some distance away he spotted the Beast he wanted. Head down, it was galloping towards him, right on the very edge of the herd. Old Thrashbarg switched the bird, the Beast looked up, tossed its head, and then, just as its head was coming down again, Arthur flourished the towel in the Beast's line of sight. It tossed its head again in bemusement, and its eyes followed the movement of the towel. 
He had got the Beast's attention. 
From that moment on, it seemed the most natural thing to coax and draw the animal towards him. Its head was up, cocked slightly to one side. It was slowing to a canter and then a trot. A few seconds later the huge thing was standing there amongst them, snorting, panting, sweating, and sniffing excitedly at the pikka bird, which appeared not to have noticed its arrival at all. With strange sort of sweeping movements of his arms Old Thrashbarg kept the pikka bird in front of the Beast, but always out of its reach and always downwards. With strange sort of sweeping movements of the towel, Arthur kept drawing the Beast's attention this way and that always downwards. 
"I don't think I've ever seen anything quite so stupid in my life," muttered Ford to himself. 
At last, the Beast dropped, bemused but docile, to its knees. "Go!" whispered Old Thrashbarg urgently, to Ford. "Go! Go now!" 
Ford leapt up on to the great creature's back, scrabbling amongst its thick knotty fur for purchase, grasping great handfuls of the stuff to hold him steady once he was in position. 
"Now, Sandwich Maker! Go!" He performed some elaborate sign and ritual handshake which Arthur couldn't quite get the hang of because Old Thrashbarg had obviously made it up on the spur of the moment, then he pushed Arthur forward. Taking a deep breath, he clambered up behind Ford on to the great, hot, heaving back of the beast and held on tight. Huge muscles the size of sea lions rippled and flexed beneath him. 
Old Thrashbarg held the bird suddenly aloft. The Beast's head swivelled up to follow it. Thrashbarg pushed upwards and upwards repeatedly with his arms and with the pikka bird; and slowly, heavily the Perfectly Normal Beast lurched up off its knees and stood, at last, swaying slightly. Its two riders held on fiercely and nervously. 
Arthur gazed out over the sea of hurtling animals, straining in an attempt to see where it was they were going, but there was nothing but heat haze. 
"Can you see anything?" he said to Ford. 
"No." Ford twisted round to glance back, trying to see if there was any clue as to where they had come from. Still, nothing. 
Arthur shouted down at Thrashbarg. 
"Do you know where they come from?" he called. "Or where they're going?" 
"The domain of the King!" shouted Old Thrashbarg back. 
"King?" shouted Arthur in surprise. "What King?" The Perfectly Normal Beast was swaying and rocking restlessly under him. 
"What do you mean, what King?" shouted Old Thrashbarg. "The King." 
"It's just that you never mentioned a King," shouted Arthur back, in some consternation. 
"What?" shouted Old Thrashbarg. The thrumming of a thousand hooves was very hard to hear over, and the old man was concentrating on what he was doing. 
Still holding the bird aloft, he led the Beast slowly round till it was once more parallel with the motion of its great herd. He moved forward. The Beast followed. He moved forward again. The Beast 
followed again. At last, the Beast was lumbering forward with a little momentum. 
"I said you never mentioned a King!" shouted Arthur again. 
"I didn't say a King," shouted Old Thrashbarg, "I said the King." 
He drew back his arm and then hurled it forward with all his strength, casting the pikka bird up into the air above the herd. This seemed to catch the pikka bird completely by surprise as it had obviously not been paying any attention at all to what was going on. It took it a moment or two to work out what was happening, then it unfurled its little wings, spread them out, and flew. 
"Go!" shouted Thrashbarg. "Go and meet your destiny, Sandwich Maker!" 
Arthur wasn't so sure about wanting to meet his destiny as such. He just wanted to get to wherever it was they were going so he could get back off this creature again. He didn't feel at all safe up there. The Beast was gathering speed as it followed in the wake of the pikka bird. And then it was in at the fringes of the great tide of animals, and in a moment or two, with its head down, the pikka bird forgotten, it was running with the herd again and rapidly approaching the point at which the herd was vanishing into thin air. Arthur and Ford held on to the great monster for dear life, surrounded on all sides by hurtling mountains of bodies. 
"Go! Ride that Beast!" shouted Thrashbarg. His distant voice reverberated faintly in their ears. "Ride that Perfectly Normal Beast! Ride it, ride it!" 
Ford shouted in Arthur's ear, "Where did he say we were going?" 
"He said something about a King," shouted Arthur in return, holding on desperately. 
"What King?" 
"That's what I said. He just said the King." 
"I didn't know there was a the King," shouted Ford. 
"Nor did I," shouted Arthur back. 
"Except of course for the King," shouted Ford. "And I don't suppose he meant him." 
"What King?" shouted Arthur. 
The point of exit was almost upon them. Just ahead of them, Perfectly Normal Beasts were galloping into nothingness and vanishing. 
"What do you mean, what King?" shouted Ford. "I don't know what King. I'm only saying that he couldn't possibly mean the King, so I don't know what he means." 
"Ford, I don't know what you're talking about." 
"So?" said Ford. Then with a sudden rush, the stars came on, turned and twisted around their heads, and then, just as suddenly, turned off again. 
Chapter 21 
Misty grey buildings loomed and flickered. They bounced up and down in a highly embarrassing way. 
What sort of buildings were they? 
What were they for? What did they remind her of? 
It's so difficult to know what things are supposed to be when you suddenly turn up unexpectedly on a different world which has a different culture, a different set of the most basic assumptions about life, and also incredibly dull and meaningless architecture. 
The sky above the buildings was a cold and hostile black. The stars, which should have been blindingly brilliant points of light this far from the sun were blurred and dulled by the thickness of the huge shielding bubble. Perspex or something like it. Something dull and heavy anyway. 
Tricia wound the tape back again to the beginning. 
She knew there was something slightly odd about it. 
Well, in fact, there were about a million things that were slightly odd about it, but there was one that was nagging at her and she hadn't quite got it. 
She sighed and yawned. 
As she waited for the tape to rewind she cleared away some of the dirty polystyrene coffee cups that had accumulated on the editing desk and tipped them into the bin. 
She was sitting in a small editing suite at a video production company in Soho. She had "DO NOT DISTURB" notices plastered all over the door, and a block on all incoming calls at the switch-board. This was originally to protect her astonishing scoop, but now it was to protect her from embarrassment. 
She would watch the tape all the way through again from the beginning. If she could bear to. She might do some fast forwarding here and there. 
It was about four o'clock on Monday afternoon, and she had a kind of sick feeling. She was trying to work out what the cause of this slightly sick feeling was, and there was no shortage of candidates. 
First of all, it had all come on top of the overnight flight from New York. The red eye. Always a killer, that. 
Then, being accosted by aliens on her lawn and flown to the planet Rupert. She was not sufficiently experienced in that sort of thing to be able to say for sure that that was always a killer, but she would be prepared to bet that those who went through it regularly cursed it. There were always stress charts being published in magazines. Fifty stress points for losing your job. Seventy-five points for a divorce or changing your hairstyle and so on. None of them ever mentioned being accosted on your lawn by aliens and then being flown to the planet Rupert, but she was sure it was worth a few dozen points. 
It wasn't that the journey had been particularly stressful. It had been extremely dull in fact. Certainly it had been no more stressful than the trip she had just taken across the Atlantic and it had taken roughly the same time, about seven hours. 
Well that was pretty astounding wasn't it? Flying to the outer limits of the solar system in the same time that it took to fly to New York meant they must have some fantastic unheard-of form of propulsion in the ship. She quizzed her hosts about it and they agreed that it was pretty good. 
"But how does it work?" she had demanded excitedly. She was still quite excited at the beginning of the trip. 
She found that part of the tape and played it through to herself. The Grebulons, which is what they called themselves, were politely showing her which buttons they pressed to make the ship go. 
"Yes, but what principle does it work on?" she heard herself demand, from behind the camera. 
"Oh, you mean is it something like a warp drive or something like that?" they said. 
"Yes," persisted Tricia. "What is it?"â¨"It probably is something of the kind," they said. "Like what?" 
"Warp drive, photon drive, something like that. You'd have to ask the Flight Engineer." 
"Which one is he?" 
"We don't know. We have all lost our minds, you see." 
"Oh yes," said Tricia, a little faintly. "So you said. Um, how did you lose your minds, exactly, then?." 
"We don't know," they said, patiently. 
"Because you've lost your minds," echoed Tricia, glumly. 
"Would you like to watch television? It is a long flight. We watch television. It is something we enjoy." 
All of this riveting stuff was on the tape, and fine viewing it made. First of all the picture quality was extremely poor. Tricia didn't know why this was, exactly. She had a feeling that the Grebulons responded to a slightly different range of light frequencies, and that there had been a lot of ultra-violet around which was mucking up the video camera. There were a lot of interference patterns and video snow as well. Probably something to do with the warp drive that none of them knew the first thing about. 
So what she had on tape, essentially, was a bunch of slightly thin and discoloured people sitting around watching televisions that were showing network broadcasts. She had also pointed the camera out of the very tiny viewport near her seat and got a nice, slightly streaky effect of stars. She knew it was real, but it would have taken a good three or four minutes to fake. 
In the end she had decided to save her precious videotape for Rupert itself and had simply sat back and watched television with them. She had even dozed off for a while. 
So part of her sick feeling came from the sense that she had had all that time in an alien spacecraft of astounding technological design, and had spent most of it dozing in front of reruns of M*A*S*H and Cagney and Lacey. But what else was there to do? She had taken some photos as well, of course, all of which had subsequently turned out to be badly fogged when she got them back from the chemist. 
Another part of her sick feeling probably came from the landing on Rupert. This at least had been dramatic and hair-raising. The ship had come sweeping in over a dark and sombre landscape, a terrain so desperately far removed from the heat and light of its parent sun that it seemed like a map of the psychological scars on the mind of an abandoned child. 
Lights blazed through the frozen darkness and Guided the ship into the mouth of some kind of cave that seemed to bend itself open to accept the small craft. 
Unfortunately, because of the angle of their approach, and the depth at which the small thick viewport was set into the craft's skin, it hadn't been possible to get the video camera to point directly at any of it. She ran through that bit of the tape. 
The camera was pointing directly at the sun. 
This is normally very bad for a video camera. But when the sun is roughly a third of a billion miles away it doesn't do any harm. In fact it hardly makes any impression at all. You just get a small point of light right in the middle of the frame, which could be just about anything. It was just one star in a multitude. 
Tricia fast-forwarded. 
Ah. Now, the next bit had been quite promising. They had emerged out of the ship into a vast, grey, hangar-like structure. This was clearly alien technology on a dramatic scale. Huge grey buildings under the dark canopy of the Perspex bubble. These were the same buildings that she had been looking at the end of the tape. She had taken more footage of them while leaving Rupert a few hours later, just as she was about to reboard the spacecraft for the journey home. What did they remind her of? 
Well, as much as anything else they reminded her of a film set from just about any low-budget science-fiction movie of the last twenty years. A lot larger, of course, but it all looked thoroughly tawdry and unconvincing on the video screen. Apart from the dreadful picture quality she had been struggling with the unexpected effects of gravity that was appreciably lower than that on Earth, and she had found it very hard to keep the camera from bouncing around in an embarrassingly unprofessional way. It was therefore impossible to make out any detail. 
And now here was the Leader coming forward to greet her, smiling and sticking his hand out. 
That was all he was called. The Leader. 
None of the Grebulons had names, largely because they couldn't think of any. Tricia discovered that some of them had thought of calling themselves after characters from television programmes they 
had picked up from Earth, but hard as they had tried to call each other Wayne and Bobby and Chuck, some remnant of something lurking deep in the cultural subconscious they had brought with them from the distant stars which were their homes must have told them that this really wasn't right and wouldn't do. 
The Leader had looked pretty much like all the others. Possibly a bit less thin. He said how much he enjoyed her shows on TV, that he was her greatest fan, how glad he was that she had been able to come along and visit them on Rupert and how much everybody had been looking forward to her coming, how he hoped the flight had been comfortable and so on. There was no particular sense she could detect of being any kind of emissary from the stars or anything. 
Certainly, watching it now on videotape, he just looked like some guy in costume and make-up, standing in front of a set that wouldn't hold up too well if you leant against it. 
She sat staring at the screen with her face cradled in her hands, and shaking her head in slow bewilderment. 
This was awful. 
Not only was this bit awful but she knew what was coming next. It was the bit where the Leader asked if she was hungry after the flight, and would she perhaps like to come and have something to eat? They could discuss things over a little dinner. 
She could remember what she was thinking at this point. Alien food. 
How was she going to deal with it? 
Would she actually have to eat it? Would she have access to some sort of paper napkin she could spit stuff out into? Wouldn't there be all sorts of differential immunity problems? 
It turned out to be hamburgers. 
Not only did it turn out to be hamburgers, but the hamburgers it turned out to be were very clearly and obviously McDonald's hamburgers which had been reheated in a microwave. It wasn't just the look of them. It wasn't just the smell. It was the polystyrene clamshell packages they came in which had "McDonald's" printed all over them. 
"Eat! Enjoy!" said the Leader. "Nothing is too good for our honoured guest!" 
This was in his private apartment. Tricia had looked around it in bewilderment that had bordered on fear but had nevertheless got it all on videotape. 
The apartment had a waterbed in it. And a Midi hi-fi. And one of those tall electrically illuminated glass things which sit on table tops and appear to have large globules of sperm floating about in them. The walls were covered in velvet. 
The leader lounged against a brown corduroy bean bag and squirted breath-freshener into his mouth. 
Tricia began to feel very scared, suddenly. She was further from Earth than any human being, to her knowledge, had ever been, and she was with an alien creature, who was lounging against a brown corduroy bean bag and squirting breath-freshener into his mouth. 
She didn't want to make any false moves. She didn't want to alarm him. But there were things she had to know. 
"How did you... where did you get... this?" she asked, gesturing around the room, nervously. 
"The decor?" asked the Leader. "Do you like it? It is very sophisticated. We are a sophisticated people, we Grebulons. We buy sophisticated consumer durables... by mail order." 
Tricia had nodded tremendously slowly at this point. 
"Mail order..." she had said. 
The Leader chuckled. It was one of those dark chocolate reassuring silky chuckles. 
"I think you think they ship it here. No! Ha Ha! We have arranged a special box number in New Hampshire. We make regular pick-up visits. Ha Ha!" He lounged back in a relaxed fashion on his bean bag, reached for a reheated french fry and nibbled the end of it, an amused smile playing across. his lips. 
Tricia could feel her brain beginning to bubble very slightly. She kept the video camera going. 
"How do you, well, er, how do you pay for these wonderful...things?" 
The Leader chuckled again. 
"American Express," he said with a nonchalant shrug. 
Tricia nodded slowly again. She knew that they gave cards exclusively to just about anybody. 
"And these?" she said, holding up the hamburger he had presented her with. 
"It is very easy," said the Leader. "We stand in line." 
Again, Tricia realised with a cold, trickling feeling going down her spine, that explained an awful lot. 
She hit the fast forward button again. There was nothing of any use here at all. It was all nightmarish madness. She could have faked something that would have looked more convincing. 
Another sick feeling began to creep over her as she watched this hopeless awful tape, and she began, with slow horror, to realise that it must be the answer. 
She must be... 
She shook her head and tried to get a grip. 
An overnight flight going East... The sleeping pills she had taken to get her through it. The vodka she'd had to set the sleeping pills going. 
What else? Well. There was seventeen years of obsession that a glamorous man with two heads, one of which was disguised as a parrot in a cage, had tried to pick her up at a party but had then impatiently flown off to another planet in a flying saucer. There suddenly seemed to be all sorts of bothersome aspects to that idea that had never really occurred to her. Never occurred to her. In seventeen years. 
She stuffed her fist into her mouth. 
She must get help. 
Then there had been Eric Bartlett banging on about alienâ¨spacecraft landing on her lawn. And before that... New York had been, well, very hot and stressful. The high hopes and the bitter disappointment. The astrology stuff. 
She must have had a nervous breakdown. 
That was it. She was exhausted and she had had a nervous breakdown and had started hallucinating some time after she got home. She had dreamt the whole story. An alien race of people 
dispossessed of their own lives and histories, stuck on a remote outpost of our solar system and filling their cultural vacuum with our cultural junk. Ha! It was nature's way of telling her to check into an expensive medical establishment very quickly. 
She was very, very sick. She looked at how many large coffees she'd got through as well, and realised how heavily she was breathing and how fast. 
Part of solving any problem, she told herself, was realising that you had it. She started to bring her breathing under control. She had caught herself in time. She had seen where she was. She was on the way back from whatever psychological precipice she had been on the brink of. She started to calm down, to calm down, to calm down. She sat back in the chair and closed her eyes. 
After a while, now that she was breathing normally again, she opened them again. 
So where had she got this tape from then? ***â¨It was still running.â¨All right. It was a fake. 
She had faked it herself, that was it. 
It must have been her who had faked it because her voice was all over the soundtrack, asking questions. Every now and then the camera would swing down at the end of a shot and she would see her own feet in her own shoes. She had faked it and she had no recollection of faking it or any idea of why she had done it. 
Her breathing was getting hectic again as she watched the snowy, flickering screen. 
She must still be hallucinating. 
She shook her head, trying to make it go away. She had no memory of faking any of this very obviously fake stuff. On the other hand she did seem to have memories that were very like the faked stuff. She continued to watch in a bewildered trance. 
The person she imagined to be called the Leader was questioning her about astrology and she was answering smoothly and calmly. Only she could detect the well-disguised rising panic in her own voice. 
The Leader pushed a button, and a maroon velvet wall slid aside, revealing a large bank of flat TV monitors. 
Each of the monitors was showing a kaleidoscope of different images: a few seconds from a game show, a few seconds from a cop show, a few seconds from a supermarket warehouse security system, a few seconds from somebody's holiday movies, a few seconds of sex, a few seconds of news, a few seconds of comedy. It was clear that the Leader was very proud of all this stuff and he was waving his hands like a conductor while continuing at the same time to talk complete gibberish. 
Another wave of his hands, and all the screens cleared to form one giant computer screen showing in diagrammatic form all the planets of the solar system and mapped out against a background of the stars in their constellations. The display was completely static. 
"We have great skills," the Leader was saying. "Great skills in computation, in cosmological trigonometry, in three-dimensional navigational calculus. Great skills. Great, great skills. Only we have lost them. It is too bad. We like to have skills only they have gone. They are in space somewhere, hurtling. With our names and the details of our homes and loved ones. Please," he said, gesturing her forward to sit at the computer's console, "be skilful for us." 
Obviously what happened next was that Tricia quickly set the video camera up on its tripod to capture the whole scene. She then walked into shot herself and sat down calmly in front of the giant computer display, spent a few moments familiarising herself with the interface and then started smoothly and competently to pretend that she had the faintest idea what she was doing. 
It hadn't been that difficult, in fact. 
She was, after all, a mathematician and astrophysicist by training and a television presenter by experience, and what science she had forgotten over the years she was more than capable of making up by bluffing. 
The computer she was working on was clear evidence that the Grebulons came from a far more advanced and sophisticated culture than their current vacuous state suggested, and with its aid she was able, within about half an hour, to cobble together a rough working model of the solar system. 
It wasn't particularly accurate or anything, but it looked good. The planets were whizzing around in reasonably good simulations of their orbits, and you could watch the movement of the whole piece of virtual cosmological clockwork from any point within the system very roughly. You could watch from Earth, you could watch from Mars, etc. You could watch from the surface of the planet Rupert. Tricia had been quite impressed with herself, but also very impressed with the computer system she was working on. Using a computer workstation on Earth the task would probably have taken a year or so of programming. 
When she was finished, the Leader came up behind her and watched. He was very pleased and delighted with what she had achieved. 
"Good," he said. "And now, please, I would like you to demonstrate how to use the system you have just designed to translate the information in this book for me." 
Quietly he put a book down in front of her. It was You and Your Planets by Gail Andrews. 
Tricia stopped the tape again. 
She was definitely feeling very wobbly indeed. The feeling that she was hallucinating had now receded, but had not left anything any easier or clearer in her head. 
She pushed her seat back from the editing desk and wondered what to do. Years ago she had left the field of astronomical research because she knew, without any doubt whatsoever, that she had met a being from another planet. At a party. And she had also known, without any doubt whatsoever, that she would have made herself a laughing stock if she had ever said so. But how could she study cosmology and not say anything about the single most important thing she knew about it? She had done the only thing she could do. She had left. 
Now she worked in television and the same thing had happened again. 
She had videotape, actual videotape of the most astounding story in the history of, well anything: a forgotten outpost of an alien 
civilisation marooned on the outermost planet of our own solar system. 
She had the story. 
She had been there. 
She had seen it. 
She had the videotape for God's sake. 
And if she ever showed it to anybody, she would be a laughing stock. 
How could she prove any of this? It wasn't even worth thinking about. The whole thing was a nightmare from virtually any angle she cared to look at it from. Her head was beginning to throb. 
She had some aspirin in her bag. She went out of the little editing suite to the water dispenser down the corridor. She took the aspirin and drank several cups of water. 
The place seemed to be very quiet. Usually there were more people bustling about the place, or at least some people bustling around the place. She popped her head round the door of the editing suite next to hers but there was no one there. 
She had gone rather overboard keeping people out of her own suite. "DO NOT DISTURB," the notice read. "DO NOT EVEN THINK OF ENTERING. I DON'T CARE WHAT IT IS. GO AWAY. I'M BUSY!" 
When she went back in she noticed that the message light on her phone extension was winking, and wondered how long it had been on. 
"Hello?" she said to the receptionist. 
"Oh, Miss McMillan, I'm so glad you called. Everybody's been trying to reach you. Your TV company. They're desperate to reach you. Can you call them?" 
"Why didn't you put them through?" said Tricia. 
"You said I wasn't to put anybody through for anything. You said I was to deny that you were even here. I didn't know what to do. I came up to give you a message, but..." 
"OK," said Tricia, cursing herself. She phoned her office. "Tricia! Where the haemorrhaging fuck are you?"â¨"At the editing..."â¨"They said..." 
"I know. What's up?"â¨"What's up? Only a bloody alien spaceship!" "What? Where?" 
"Regent's Park. Big silver job. Some girl with a bird. She speaks English and throws rocks at people and wants someone to repair her watch. Just get there." 
Tricia stared at it. 
It wasn't a Grebulon ship. Not that she was suddenly an expert on extraterrestrial craft, but this was a sleek and beautiful silver and white thing about the size of a large ocean going yacht, which is what it most resembled. Next to this, the structures of the huge half- dismantled Grebulon ship looked like gun turrets on a battleship. Gun turrets. That's what those blank grey buildings had looked like. And what was odd about them was that by the time she passed them again on her way to reboarding the small Grebulon craft, they had moved. These things flitted briefly through her head as she ran from the taxi to meet her camera crew. 
"Where's the girl?" she shouted above the noise of helicopters and police sirens. 
"There!" shouted the producer while the sound engineer hurried to clip a radio mike to her. "She says her mother and father came from here in some parallel dimension or something like that, and she's got her father's watch, and... I don't know. What can I tell you? Busk it. Ask her what it feels like to be from outer space." 
"Thanks a lot, Ted," muttered Tricia, checked that her mike was securely clipped, gave the engineer some level, took a deep breath, tossed her hair back and switched into her role of professional reporter, on home ground, ready for anything. 
At least, nearly anything. 
She turned to look for the girl. That must be her, with the wild hair and wild eyes. The girl turned towards her. And stared. 
"Mother!" she screamed, and started to hurl rocks at Tricia. 
Chapter 22 
Daylight exploded around them. Hot, heavy sun. A desert plain stretched out ahead in a haze of heat. They thundered out into it. 
"Jump!" shouted Ford Prefect.â¨"What?" shouted Arthur Dent, holding on for dear life. There was no reply. 
"What did you say?" shouted Arthur again, and then realised that Ford Prefect was no longer there. He looked around in panic and started to slip. Realising he couldn't hold on any longer he pushed himself sideways as hard as he could and rolled into a ball as he hit the ground, rolling, rolling away from the pounding hooves. 
What a day, he thought, as he started furiously coughing dust up out of his lungs. He hadn't had a day as bad as this since the Earth had been blown up. He staggered up to his knees, and then up to his feet and started to run away. He didn't know what from or what to, but running away seemed a prudent move. 
He ran straight into Ford Prefect who was standing there surveying the scene. 
"Look," said Ford. "That is precisely what we need." 
Arthur coughed up some more dust, and wiped some other dust out of his hair and eyes. He turned, panting, to look at what Ford was looking at. 
It didn't look much like the domain of a King, or the King, or any kind of King. It looked quite inviting though. 
First, the context. This was a desert world. The dusty earth was packed hard and had neatly bruised every last bit of Arthur that hadn't already been bruised by the festivities of the previous night. Some way ahead of them were great cliffs that looked like sandstone, eroded by the wind and what little rain presumably fell in those parts into wild and fantastic shapes, which matched the fantastic shapes of the giant cacti that sprouted here and there from the arid, orange landscape. 
For a moment Arthur dared to hope they had unexpectedly arrived in Arizona or New Mexico or maybe South Dakota, but there was plenty of evidence that this was not the case. 
The Perfectly Normal Beasts, for a start, still thundering, still pounding. They swept up in their tens of thousands from the far horizon, disappeared completely for about half a mile, then swept off, thundering and pounding to the distant horizon opposite. 
Then there were the spaceships parked in front of the Bar & Grill. Ah. The Domain of the King Bar & Grill. Bit of an anti-climax, thought Arthur to himself. 
In fact only one of the spaceships was parked in front of the Domain of the King Bar & Grill. The other three were in a parking lot by the side of the Bar and Grill. It was the one in front that caught the eye, though. Wonderful looking thing. Wild fins all over it, far, far too much chrome all over the fins and most of the actual bodywork painted in a shocking pink. It crouched there like an immense brooding insect and looked as if it was at any moment about to jump on something about a mile away. 
The Domain of the King Bar & Grill was slap bang in the middle of where the Perfectly Normal Beasts would be charging if they didn't take a minor transdimensional diversion on the way. It stood on its own, undisturbed. An ordinary Bar & Grill. A truckstop diner. Somewhere in the middle of nowhere. Quiet. The Domain of the King. 
"Gonna buy that spaceship," said Ford quietly. 
"Buy it?" said Arthur. "That's not like you. I thought you usually pinched them." 
"Sometimes you have to show a little respect," said Ford. 
"Probably have to show a little cash as well," said Arthur. "How the hell much is that thing worth?" 
With a tiny movement, Ford brought his Dine-O-Charge credit card up out of his pocket. Arthur noticed that the hand holding it was trembling very slightly. 
"I'll teach them to make me the restaurant critic..." breathed Ford. "What do you mean?" asked Arthur.â¨"I'll show you," said Ford with a nasty glint in his eye.â¨"Let's go and run up a few expenses shall we?" 
"Couple beers," said Ford, "and, I dunno, a couple bacon rolls, whatever you got, oh and that pink thing outside." 
He flipped his card on the top of the bar and looked around casually. 
There was a kind of silence. 
There hadn't been a lot of noise before, but there was definitely a kind of silence now. Even the distant thunder of the Perfectly Normal Beasts carefully avoiding the Domain of the King seemed suddenly a little muted. 
"Just rode into town," said Ford as if nothing was odd about that or about anything else. He was leaning against the bar at an extravagantly relaxed angle. 
There were about three other customers in the place, sitting at tables, nursing beers. About three. Some people would say there were exactly three, but it wasn't that kind of a place, not the kind of a place that you felt like being that specific in. There was some big guy setting up some stuff on the little stage as well. Old drum kit. Couple guitars. Country and Western kind of stuff. 
The barman was not moving very swiftly to get in Ford's order. In fact he wasn't moving at all. 
"Not sure that the pink thing's for sale," he said at last in the kind of accent that went on for quite a long time. 
"Sure it is," said Ford. "How much you want?" "Well..."â¨"Think of a number, I'll double it."â¨"T'ain't mine to sell," said the barman. 
"So, whose?" 
The barman nodded at the big guy setting up on the stage. Big fat guy, moving slow, balding. 
Ford nodded. He grinned.â¨"OK," he said. "Get the beers, get the rolls. Keep the tab open." 
Arthur sat at the bar and rested. He was used to not knowing what was going on. He felt comfortable with it. The beer was pretty good and made him a little sleepy which he didn't mind at all. The bacon rolls were not bacon rolls. They were Perfectly Normal Beast rolls. He 
exchanged a few professional roll-making remarks with the barman and just let Ford get on with whatever Ford wanted to do. 
"OK," said Ford, returning to his stool. "It's cool. We got the pink thing." 
The barman was very surprised. "He's selling it to you?" 
"He's giving it to us for free," said Ford, taking a gnaw at his roll. "Hey, no, keep the tab open though. We have some items to add to it. Good roll." 
He took a deep pull of beer. 
"Good beer," he added. "Good ship too," he said, eying the big pink and chrome insect-like thing, bits of which could be seen through the windows of the bar. "Good everything, pretty much. You know, he said, sitting back, reflectively, "it's at times like this that you kind of wonder if it's worth worrying about the fabric of space/time and the causal integrity of the multi-dimensional probability matrix and the potential collapse of all wave forms in the Whole Sort of General Mish Mash and all that sort of stuff that's been bugging me. Maybe I feel that what the big guy says is right. Just let it all go. What does it matter? Let it go." 
"Which big guy?" said Arthur. 
Ford just nodded towards the stage. The big guy was saying "one two" into the mike a couple of times. Couple other guys were on the stage now. Drums. Guitar. 
The barman, who had been silent for a moment or two, said, "You say he's letting you have his ship?" 
"Yeah," said Ford. "Let it all go is what he said. Take the ship. Take it with my blessing. Be good to her. I will he good to her." 
He took a pull at his beer again. 
"Like I was saying," he went on. "It's at times like this that you kind of think, let it all go. But then you think of guys like InfiniDim Enterprises and you think, they are not going to get away with it. They are going to suffer. It is my sacred and holy duty to see those guys suffer. Here, let me put something on the tab for the singer. I asked for a special request and we agreed. It's to go on the tab. OK?" 
"OK," said the barman, cautiously. Then he shrugged. "OK, however you want to do it. How much?" 
Ford named a figure. The barman fell over amongst the bottles and glasses. Ford vaulted quickly over the bar to check that he was all right and help him back up to his feet. He'd cut his finger and his elbow a bit and was feeling a little woozy but was otherwise fine. The big guy started to sing. The barman hobbled off with Ford's credit card to get authorisation. 
"Is there stuff going on here that I don't know about?" said Arthur to Ford. 
"Isn't there usually?" said Ford. 
"No need to be like that," said Arthur. He began to wake up. "Shouldn't we be going?" he said suddenly. "Will that ship get us to Earth?" 
"Sure will," said Ford. 
"That's where Random will be going!" said Arthur with a start. "We can follow her! But... er..." 
Ford let Arthur get on with thinking things out for himself while he got out his old edition of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. 
"But where are we on the probability axis thing?" said Arthur. "Will the Earth be there or not there? I spent so much time looking for it. All I found was planets that were a bit like it or not at all like it, though it was clearly the right place because of the continents. The worst version was called NowWhat where I got bitten by some wretched little animal. That's how they communicated, you know, by biting each other. Bloody painful. Then half the time, of course, the Earth isn't even there because it's been blown up by the bloody Vogons. How much sense am I making?" 
Ford didn't comment. He was listening to something. He passed the Guide over to Arthur and pointed at the screen. The active entry read "Earth. Mostly harmless." 
"You mean it's there!" said Arthur excitedly. "The Earth is there! That's where Random will be going! The bird was showing her the Earth in the rainstorm!" 
Ford motioned Arthur to shout a little less loudly. He was listening. 
Arthur was growing impatient. He'd heard bar singers sing "Love Me Tender" before. He was a bit surprised to hear it here, right in the middle of wherever the hell this was, certainly not Earth, but then things tended not to surprise him these days as much as formerly. The 
singer was quite good, as bar singers went, if you liked that sort of thing, but Arthur was getting fretful. 
He glanced at his watch. This only served to remind him that he didn't have his watch any more. Random had it, or at least the remains of it. 
"Don't you think we should be going?" he said, insistently. 
"Shhh!" said Ford. "I paid to hear this song." He seemed to have tears in his eyes, which Arthur found a bit disturbing. He'd never seen Ford moved by anything other than very, very strong drink. Probably the dust. He waited, tapping his fingers irritably, out of time with the music. 
The song ended. The singer went on to do "Heartbreak Hotel". "Anyway," Ford whispered, "I've got to review the restaurant." "What?"â¨"I have to write a review." 
"Write a review? Of this place?" 
"Filing the review validates the expenses claim. I've fixed it so that it happens completely automatically and untraceably. This bill is going to need some validation," he added quietly, staring into his beer with a nasty smirk. 
"For a couple of beers and a roll?" "And a tip for the singer."â¨"Why, how much did you tip him?" Ford named a figure again. 
"I don't know how much that is," said Arthur. "What's it worth in pounds sterling? What would it buy you?" 
"It would probably buy you, roughly... er..." Ford screwed his eyes up as he did some calculations in his head. "Switzerland," he said at last. He picked up his Hitchhiker's Guide and started to type. 
Arthur nodded intelligently. There were times when he wished he understood what on earth Ford was talking about, and other times, like now, when he felt it was probably safer not even to try. He looked over Ford's shoulder. "This isn't going to take long, is it?" he said. 
"Nah," said Ford. "Piece of piss. Just mention that the rolls were quite good, the beer good and cold, local wildlife nicely eccentric, the 
bar singer the best in the known universe, and that's about it. Doesn't need much. Just a validation." 
He touched an area on the screen marked ENTER and the message vanished into the Sub-Etha. 
"You thought the singer was pretty good then?" 
"Yeah," said Ford. The barman was returning with a piece of paper, which seemed to be trembling in his hand. 
He pushed it over to Ford with a kind of nervous, reverential twitch. 
"Funny thing," said the barman. "The system rejected it first couple times. Can't say it surprised me." Beads of sweat were standing on his brow. "Then suddenly it's, oh yeah, that's OK, and the system... er, validates it. Just like that. You wanna...sign it?" 
Ford scanned the form quickly. He sucked his teeth. "This is going to hurt InfiniDim a lot," he said, with an appearance of concern. "Oh well," he added softly, "screw 'em." 
He signed with a flourish and handed it back to the barman. 
"More money," he said, "than the Colonel made for him in an entire career of doing crap movies and casino gigs. Just for doing what he does best. Standing up and singing in a bar. And he negotiated it himself. I think this is a good moment for him. Tell him I said thanks and buy him a drink." He tossed a few coins on the bar. The barman pushed them away. 
"I don't think that's necessary," he said, slightly hoarsely. "Tis to me," said Ford. "OK, we are outa here." 
They stood out in the heat and the dust and looked at the big pink and chrome thing with amazement and admiration. Or at least, Ford looked at it with amazement and admiration. 
Arthur just looked at it. "You don't think it's a bit overdone, do you?" 
He said it again when they climbed inside it. The seats and quite a lot of the controls were covered in fine fur skin or suede. There was a big gold monogram on the main control panel which just read "EP". 
"You know," said Ford as he fired up the ship's engines, "I asked him if it was true that he had been abducted by aliens, and you know what he said?" 
"Who?" said Arthur. 
"The King." 
"Which King? Oh, we've had this conversation, haven't we?" 
"Never mind," said Ford. "For what it's worth, he said, no. He went of his own accord." 
"I'm still not sure who we're talking about," said Arthur. Ford shook his head. "Look," he said, "there are some tapes over in the compartment to your left. Why don't you choose some music and put it on?" 
"OK," said Arthur, and flipped through the cartons. "Do you like Elvis Presley?" he said. 
"Yeah I do as a matter of fact," said Ford. "Now. I hope this machine can leap like it looks like it can." He engaged the main drive. 
"Yeeehaah!" shouted Ford as they shot upwards at face-tearing speed. 
It could. 
Chapter 23 
The news networks don't like this kind of thing. They regard it as a waste. An incontrovertible spaceship arrives out of nowhere in the middle of London and it is sensational news of the highest magnitude. Another completely different one arrives three and a half hours later and somehow it isn't. 
"ANOTHER SPACECRAFT!" said the headlines and news stand billboards. "THIS ONE'S PINK." A couple of months later they could have made a lot more of it. The third spacecraft, half an hour after that, the little four berth Hrundi runabout, only made it on to the local news. 
Ford and Arthur had come screaming down out of the stratosphere and parked neatly on Portland Place. It was just after six-thirty in the evening and there were spaces free. They mingled briefly with the crowd that gathered round to ogle, then said loudly that if no one else was going to call the police they would, and made good their escape. 
"Home..." said Arthur, a husky tone creeping into his voice as he gazed, misty-eyed around him. 
"Oh don't get all maudlin on me," snapped Ford. "We have to find your daughter and we have to find that bird thing." 
"How?" said Arthur. "This is a planet of five and a half billion people, and..." 
"Yes," said Ford. "But only one of them has just arrived from outer space in a large silver spaceship accompanied by a mechanical bird. I suggest we just find a television and something to drink while we watch it. We need some serious room service." They checked into a large two-bedroomed suite at the Langham. Mysteriously, Ford's Dine-O-Charge card, issued on a planet over five thousand light years away, seemed to present the hotel's computer with no problems. 
Ford hit the phones straight away while Arthur attempted to locate the television. 
"OK," said Ford. "I want to order up some margaritas please. Couple of pitchers. Couple of Chef's Salads. And as much foie gras as you've got. And also London Zoo." 
"She's on the news!" shouted Arthur from the next room. 
"That's what I said," said Ford into the phone. "London Zoo. Just charge it to the room." 
"She's... Good God!" shouted Arthur. "Do you know who she's being interviewed by?" 
"Are you having difficulty understanding the English language?" continued Ford. "It's the zoo just up the road from here. I don't care if it's closed this evening. I don't want to buy a ticket, I just want to buy the zoo. I don't care if you're busy. This is room service, I'm in a room and I want some service. Got a piece of paper? OK. Here's what I want you to do. All the animals that can be safely returned to the wild, return them. Set up some good teams of people to monitor their progress in the wild, see that they're doing OK." 
"It's Trillian!" shouted Arthur. "Or is it... er... God, I can't stand all this parallel universe stuff. It's so bloody confusing. It seems to be a different Trillian. It's Tricia McMillan which is what Trillian used to be called before... er... Why don't you come and watch, see if you can figure it out?" 
"Just a second," Ford shouted, and returned to his negotiations with room service. "Then we'll need some natural reserves for the animals that can't hack it in the wild," he said. "Set up a team to work out the best places to do that. We might need to buy somewhere like Zaire and maybe some islands. Madagascar. Baffin. Sumatra. Those kind of places. We'll need a wide variety of habitats. Look, I don't see why you're seeing this as a problem. Learn to delegate. Hire whoever you want. Get on to it. I think you'll find my credit is good. And blue cheese dressing on the salad. Thank you." 
He put the phone down and went through to Arthur, who was sitting on the edge of his bed watching television. 
"I ordered us some foie gras," said Ford. 
"What?" said Arthur, whose attention was entirely focused on the television. 
"I said I ordered us some foie gras." 
"Oh," said Arthur, vaguely. "Um, I always feel a hit bad about foie gras. Bit cruel to the geese, isn't it?" 
"Fuck 'em," said Ford, slumping on the bed. "You can't care about every damn thing." 
"Well, that's all very well for you to say, but..." 
"Drop it!" said Ford. "If you don't like it I'll have yours. What's happening?" 
"Chaos!" said Arthur. "Complete chaos! Random keeps on screaming at Trillian, or Tricia or whoever it is, that she abandonedâ¨her and then demanding to go to a good night club. Tricia's broken down in tears and says she's never even met Random let alone given birth to her. Then she suddenly started howling about someone called Rupert and said that he had lost his mind or something. I didn't quite follow that bit, to be honest. Then Random started throwing stuff and they've cut to a commercial break while they try and sort it all out. Oh! They've just cut back to the studio! Shut up and watch." 
A rather shaken anchorman appeared on the screen and apologised to viewers for the disruption of the previous item. He said he didn't have any very clear news to report, only that the mysterious girl, who called herself Random Frequent Flyer Dent had left the studio to, er, rest. Tricia McMillan would be, he hoped, back tomorrow. Meanwhile, fresh reports of UFO activity were coming in... 
Ford leaped up off the bed, grabbed the nearest phone and jabbed at a number. 
"Concierge? You want to own the hotel? It's yours if you can find out for me in five minutes which clubs Tricia McMillan belongs to. Just charge the whole thing to this room." 
Chapter 24 
Away in the inky depths of space invisible movements were being made. 
Invisible to any of the inhabitants of the strange and temperamental Plural zone at the focus of which lay the infinitely multitudinous possibilities of the planet called Earth, but not inconsequential to them. 
At the very edge of the solar system, hunkered down on a green leatherette sofa, staring fretfully at a range of TV and computer screens sat a very worried Grebulon leader. He was fiddling with stuff. Fiddling with his book on astrology. Fiddling with the console of his computer. Fiddling with the displays being fed through to him constantly from all of the Grebulons monitoring devices, all of them focused on the planet Earth. 
He was distressed. Their mission was to monitor. But to monitor secretly. He was a bit fed up with his mission, to be honest. He was fairly certain that his mission must have been to do more than sit around watching TV for years on end. They certainly had a lot of other equipment with them that must have had some purpose if only they hadn't accidentally lost all trace of their purpose. He needed a sense of purpose in life, which was why he had turned to astrology to fill the yawning gulf that existed in the middle of his mind and soul. That would tell him something, surely. 
Well, it was telling him something. 
It was telling him, as far as he could make out, that he was about to have a very bad month, that things were going to go from bad to worse if he didn't get a grip on things and start making some positive moves and thinking things out for himself. 
It was true. It was very clear from his star chart which he had worked out using his astrology book and the computer program which that nice Tricia McMillan had designed for him to re-triangulate all the appropriate astronomical data. Earth-based astrology had to 
be entirely recalculated to yield results that were meaningful to the Grebulons here on the tenth planet out on the frozen edges of the solar system. 
The recalculations showed absolutely clearly and unamhiguously that he was going to have a very bad month indeed, starting with today. Because today Earth was starting to rise into Capricorn, and that, for the Grebulon leader, who showed all the character signs of being a classic Taurus, was very bad indeed. 
Now was the time, his horoscope said, for taking positive actions, making tough decisions, seeing what needed to be done and doing it. This was all very difficult for him, but he knew that nobody ever said that doing tough stuff wasn't tough. The computer was already tracking and predicting the second-by-second location of the planet Earth. He ordered the great grey turrets to swivel. 
Because all of the Grebulon surveillance equipment was focused on the planet Earth, it failed to spot that there was now another source of data in the solar system. 
Its chances of spotting this other source of data a massive yellow constructor ship accidentally were practically nil. It was as far from the sun as Rupert was, but almost diametrically opposite, almost hidden by the sun. 
Almost. 
The massive yellow constructor ship wanted to be able to monitor events on Planet Ten without being spotted itself. It had managed this very successfully. 
There were all sorts of other ways in which this ship was diametrically opposite to the Grebulons. 
Its leader, its Captain, had a very clear idea of what his purpose was. It was a very simple and plain one and he had been pursuing it in his simple, plain way for a considerable period of time now. 
Anyone who knew of his purpose might have said that it was a pointless and ugly one, that it wasn't the sort of purpose that enhanced a life, put a spring in a person's step, made birds sing and flowers bloom. Rather the reverse in fact. Absolutely the reverse. 
It wasn't his job to worry about that, though. It was his job to do his job, which was to do his job. If that led to a certain narrowness of 
vision and circularity of thought then it wasn't his job to worry about such things. Any such things that came his way were referred to others who had, in turn, other people to refer such things to. 
Many, many light years from here, indeed from anywhere, lies the grim and long abandoned planet, Vogsphere. Somewhere on a fetid, fog-bound mud bank on this planet there stands, surrounded by the dirty, broken and empty carapaces of the last few jeweled scuttling crabs, a small stone monument which marks the place, where it is thought, the species Vogon Vogonblurtus first arose. On the monument there is carved an arrow which points away into the fog, under which are inscribed in plain, simple letters the words "The buck stops there." 
Deep in the bowels of his unsightly yellow ship, the Vogon Captain grunted as he reached for a slightly faded and dog-eared piece of paper that lay in front of him. A demolition order. 
If you were to unravel exactly where the Captain's job, which was to do his job which was to do his job, actually began, then it all came down at last to this piece of paper that had been issued to him by his immediate superior long ago. The piece of paper had an instruction on it, and his purpose was to carry out that instruction and put a little tick mark in the adjacent box when he had carried it out. 
He had carried out the instruction once before, but a number of troublesome circumstances had prevented him from being able to put the tick in the little box. 
One of the troublesome circumstances was the Plural nature of this Galactic sector, where the possible continually interfered with the probable. Simple demolition didn't get you any further than pushing down a bubble under a badly hung strip of wallpaper. Anything you demolished kept on popping up again. That would soon be taken care of. 
Another was a small bunch of people who continually refused to be where they were supposed to be when they were supposed to be there. That, also, would soon be taken care of. 
The third was an irritating and anarchic little device called the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. That was now well and truly taken care of and, in fact, through the phenomenal power of temporal reverse engineering, it was now itself the agency through which everything else would be taken care of. The Captain had merely come 
to watch the final act of this drama. He himself did not have to lift a finger. 
"Show me," he said. 
The shadowy shape of a bird spread its wings and rose into the air near him. Darkness engulfed the bridge. Dim lights danced briefly in the black eyes of the bird as, deep in its instructional address space, bracket after bracket was finally closing, if clauses were finally ending, repeat loops halting, recursive functions calling themselves for the last few times. 
A brilliant vision lit up in the darkness, a watery blue and green vision, a tube flowing through the air, shaped like a chopped up string of sausages. 
With a flatulent noise of satisfaction, the Vogon Captain sat back to watch. 
Chapter 25 
"Just there, number forty-two," shouted Ford Prefect to the taxi- driver. "Right here!" 
The taxi lurched to a halt, and Ford and Arthur jumped out. They had stopped at quite a number of cash-dispensers on the way, and Ford chucked a fistful of money through the window at the driver. 
The entrance to the club was dark, smart and severe. Only the smallest little plaque bore its name. Members knew where it was, and if you weren't a member then knowing where it was wasn't any help to you. 
Ford Prefect was not a member of Stavro's though he had once been to Stavro's other club in New York. He had a very simple method of dealing with establishments of which he was not a member. He simply swept in as soon as the door was opened, pointed back at Arthur and said, "It's OK, he's with me." 
He bounded down the dark glossy stairs, feeling very froody in his new shoes. They were suede and they were blue, and he was very pleased that in spite of everything else going on he had been sharp- eyed enough to spot them in a shop window from the back of a speeding taxi. 
"I thought I told you not to come here." 
"What?" said Ford. 
A thin, ill-looking man wearing something baggy and Italian was walking up the stairs past them, lighting a cigarette, and had stopped, suddenly. 
"Not you," he said. "Him." 
He looked straight at Arthur, then seemed to become a little confused. 
"Excuse me," he said. "I think I must have mistaken you for someone else." He started on up the stairs again, but almost immediately turned round once more, even more puzzled. He stared at Arthur. 
"Now what?" said Ford.â¨"What did you say?"â¨"I said, now what?" repeated Ford irritably. 
"Yes, I think so," said the man and swayed slightly and dropped the book of matches he'd been carrying. His mouth moved weakly. Then he put his hand to his forehead. 
"Excuse me," he said, "I'm trying desperately to remember which drug I've just taken, but it must be one of those ones which mean you can't remember." 
He shook his head and turned away again, and went up towards the men's room. 
"Come on," said Ford. He hurried on downstairs, with Arthur following nervously in his wake. The encounter had shaken him badly and he didn't know why. 
He didn't like places like this. For all of the dreams of Earth and home he had had for years, he now badly missed his hut on Lamuella with his knives and his sandwiches. He even missed Old Thrashbarg. 
"Arthur!" 
It was the most astounding effect. His name was being shouted in stereo. 
He twisted to look one way. Up the stairs behind him he saw Trillian hurrying down towards him in her wonderfully rumpled RymplonTM. She was looking suddenly aghast. 
He twisted the other way to see what she was looking suddenly aghast at. 
At the bottom of the stairs was Trillian, wearing... No this was Tricia. Tricia that he had just seen, hysterical with confusion, on television. And behind her was Random, looking more wild-eyed than ever. Behind her in the recesses of the smart, dimly lit club, the other clientele of the evening formed a frozen tableau, staring anxiously up at the confrontation on the stairs. 
For a few seconds everyone stood stock still. Only the music from behind the bar didn't know to stop throbbing. 
"The gun she is holding," said Ford quietly, nodding slightly towards Random, "is a Wabanatta 3. It was in the ship she stole from me. It's quite dangerous in fact. Just don't move for a moment. Let's just everybody stay calm and find out what's upsetting her." 
"Where do I fit?" screamed Random suddenly. The hand holding the gun was trembling fiercely. Her other hand delved into her pocket and pulled out the remains of Arthur's watch. She shook it at them. 
"I thought I would fit here," she cried, "on the world that made me! But it turns out that even my mother doesn't know who I am!" She flung the watch violently aside, and it smashed into the glasses behind the bar, scattering its innards. 
Everyone was very quiet for a moment or two longer. "Random," said Trillian quietly from up on the stairs. "Shut up!" shouted Random. "You abandoned me!" 
"Random, it is very important that you listen to me and understand," persisted Trillian quietly. "There isn't very much time. We must leave. We must all leave." 
"What are you talking about? We're always leaving!" She had both hands on the gun now, and both were shaking. There was no one in particular she was pointing it at. She was just pointing it at the world in general. 
"Listen," said Trillian again. "I left you because I went to cover aâ¨war for the network. It was extremely dangerous. At least, I thought it was going to be. I arrived and the war had suddenly ceased to happen. There was a time anomaly and... listen! Please listen! Aâ¨reconnaissance battleship had failed to turn up, the rest of the fleet was scattered in some farcical disarray. It's happening all the time now." 
"I don't care! I don't want to hear about your bloody job!" shouted Random. "I want a home! I want to fit somewhere!" 
"This is not your home," said Trillian, still keeping her voice calm. "You don't have one. We none of us have one. Hardly anybody has one any more. The missing ship I was just talking about. The people of that ship don't have a home. They don't know where they are from. They don't even have any memory of who they are or what they are for. They are very lost and very confused and very frightened. Theyâ¨are here in this solar system, and they are about to do something very... misGuided because they are so lost and confused. We... must... leave... now. I can't tell you where there is to go to. Perhaps thereâ¨isn't anywhere. But here is not the place to be. Please. One more time. Can we go?" 
Random was wavering in panic and confusion. 
"It's all right," said Arthur gently. "If I'm here, we're safe. Don't ask me to explain just now, but I am safe, so you are safe. OK?" 
"What are you saying?" said Trillian. 
"Let's all just relax," said Arthur. He was feeling very tranquil. His life was charmed and none of this seemed real. 
Slowly, gradually, Random began to relax, and to let the gun down, inch by inch. 
Two things happened simultaneously. 
The door to the men's room at the top of the stairs opened, and the man who had accosted Arthur came out, sniffing. 
Startled at the sudden movement, Random lifted the gun again just as a man standing behind her made a grab for it. 
Arthur threw himself forward. There was a deafening explosion. He fell awkwardly as Trillian threw herself down over him. The noise died away. Arthur looked up to see the man at the top of the stairs gazing down at him with a look of utter stupefaction. 
"You..." he said. Then slowly, horribly, he fell apart. 
Random threw the gun down and fell to her knees, sobbing. "I'm sorry!" she said. "I'm so sorry! I'm so, so sorry..." 
Tricia went to her. Trillian went to her. 
Arthur sat on the stairs with his head between his hands and had not the faintest idea what to do. Ford was sitting on the stair beneath him. He picked something up, looked at it with interest, and passed it up to Arthur. 
"This mean anything to you? he said. 
Arthur took it. It was the book of matches which the dead man had dropped. It had the name of the club on it. It had the name of the proprietor of the club on it. It looked like this: 
STAVRO MUELLER BETA 
He stared at it for some time as things began slowly to reassemble themselves in his mind. He wondered what he should do, but he only wondered it idly. Around him people were beginning to rush and shout a lot, but it was suddenly very clear to him that there was 
nothing to be done, not now or ever. Through the new strangeness of noise and light he could just make out the shape of Ford Prefect sitting back and laughing wildly. 
A tremendous feeling of peace came over him. He knew that at last, for once and for ever, it was now all, finally, over. 
In the darkness of the bridge at the heart of the Vogon ship, Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz sat alone. Lights flared briefly across the external vision screens that lined one wall. In the air above him the discontinuities in the blue and green watery sausage shape resolved themselves. Options collapsed, possibilities folded into each other, and the whole at last resolved itself out of existence. 
A very deep darkness descended. The Vogon captain sat immersed in it for a few seconds. 
"Light" he said. 
There was no response. The bird, too, had crumpled out of all possibility. 
The Vogon turned on the light himself. He picked up the piece of paper again and placed a little tick in the little box. 
Well, that was done. His ship slunk off into the inky void. 
In spite of having taken what he regarded as an extremely positive piece of action, the Grebulon Leader ended up having a very bad month after all. It was pretty much the same as all the previous months except that there was now nothing on the television any more. He put on a little light music instead.

1 President: full title President of the Imperial Galactic Government. 
The term Imperial is kept though it is now an anachronism. The hereditary Emperor is nearly dead and has been so for many centuries. In the last moments of his dying coma he was locked in a statis field which keeps him in a state of perpetual unchangingness. All his heirs are now long dead, and this means that without any drastic political upheaval, power has simply and effectively moved a rung or twoâ¨down the ladder, and is now seen to be vested in a body which usedâ¨to act simply as advisers to the Emperor an elected Governmental assembly headed by a President elected by that assembly. In fact it vests in no such place. 
The President in particular is very much a figurehead he wields no real power whatsoever. He is apparently chosen by the government, but the qualities he is required to display are not those of leadership but those of finely judged outrage. For this reason the President is always a controversial choice, always an infuriating but fascinating character. His job is not to wield power but to draw attention away from it. On those criteria Zaphod Beeblebrox is one of the most successful Presidents the Galaxy has ever had he has already spent two of his ten Presidential years in prison for fraud. Very very few people realize that the President and the Government have virtually 
no power at all, and of these very few people only six know whence ultimate political power is wielded. Most of the others secretly believe that the ultimate decision-making process is handled by a computer. They couldn't be more wrong. 
2 Ford Prefect's original name is only pronuncible in an obscure Betelgeusian dialect, now virtually extinct since the Great Collapsing Hrung Disaster of Gal./Sid./Year 03758 which wiped out all the old Praxibetel communities on Betelgeuse Seven. Ford's father was the only man on the entire planet to survive the Great Collapsing Hrung disaster, by an extraordinary coincidence that he was never able satisfactorily to explain. The whole episode is shrouded in deep mystery: in fact no one ever knew what a Hrung was nor why it had chosen to collapse on Betelgeuse Seven particularly. Ford's father, magnanimously waving aside the clouds of suspicion that had inevitably settled around him, came to live on Betelgeuse Five where he both fathered and uncled Ford; in memory of his now dead race he christened him in the ancient Praxibetel tongue. 
Because Ford never learned to say his original name, his father eventually died of shame, which is still a terminal disease in some parts of the Galaxy. The other kids at school nicknamed him Ix, which in the language of Betelgeuse Five translates as "boy who is not able satisfactorily to explain what a Hrung is, nor why it should choose to collapse on Betelgeuse Seven". 

It can hardly be a coincidence that no language on Earth hasever produced the expression âas pretty as an airportâ.
Airports are ugly. Some are very ugly. Some attain a degreeof ugliness that can only be the result of a special effort. Thisugliness arises because airports ane full of people who are tired,cross, and have just discovered that their luggage has landed inMurmansk (Murmansk airport is the only known exception tothis otherwise infallible rule), and architects have on the wholetried to reflect this in their designs.
They have sought to highlight the tiredness and crossnessmotif with brutal shapes and nerve jangling colours, to makeeffortless the business of separating the traveller for ever fromhis or her luggage or loved ones, to confuse the traveller witharrows that appear to point at the windows, distant tie racks, orthe current position of Ursa Minor in the night sky, andwherever possible to expose the plumbing on the grounds that itis functional, and conceal the location of the departure gates,presumably on the grounds that they are not.
Caught in the middle of a sea of hazy light and a sea of hazynoise, Kate Schechter stood and doubted.
All the way out of London to Heathrow she had suffered fromdoubt. She was not a superstitious person, or even a religiousperson. she was simply someone who was not at all sure sheshould be flying to Norway. But she was finding it increasinglyeasy to believe that God, if there was a God, and if it wasremotely possible that any godlike being who could order thedisposition of particles at the creation of the Universe wouldalso be interested in directing traffic on the M4, did not want herto fly to Norway either. All the trouble with the tickets, finding anext-door neighbour to look after the cat, then finding the cat soit could be looked after by the next-door neighbour, the suddenleak in the roof, the missing wallet, the weather, the unexpecteddeath of the next-door neighbour, the pregnancy of the cat - itall had the semblance of an orchestrated campaign ofobstruction which had begun to assume godlike proportions.
Even the taxi-driver - when she had eventually found a taxi-had said, âNorway? What you want to go there for?â And whenshe hadnât instantly said, ââThe aurora borealis!â or âFjords!â buthad looked doubtful for a moment and bitten her lip, he had said,âI know, I bet itâs some bloke dragging you out there. Tell youwhat, tell him to stuff it. Go to Tenerife.â
There was an idea.
Tenerife.
Or even, she dared to think for a fleeting second, home.
She had stared dumbly out of the taxi window at the angrytangles of traffic and thought that however cold
and miserablethe weather was here, that was nothing to what it would be likein Norway.
Or, indeed, at home. Home would bc about as icebound asNorway right now. Icebound, and punctuated with geysers ofsteam bursting out of the grnund, catching in the frigid air anddissipating bctween the glacial
cliff faces of Sixth Avenue.
A quick glance at the itinerary Kate had pursued in the courseof her thirty years would reveal her without
any doubt to be aNew Yorker. For though she had lived in the city very little,most of her life had been spent at a constant distance from it.Los Angeles, San Francisco, Europe, and a period of distractedwandering around South America five years ago following theloss of her newly mamed husband, Luke, in a New York taxi- hailing accident.
She enjoyed the notion that New York was home, and thatshe missed it, but in fact the only thing she really missed waspizza. And not just any old pizza, but the sort of pizza theybrought to your door if you phoned them up and asked them to.That was the only real pizza. Pizza that you had to go out and sitat a table staring at red paper napkins for wasnât real pizzahowever much extra pepperoni and anchovy they put on it.
London was the place she liked living in most, apart, ofcourse, from the pizza problem, which drove her crazy. Whywould no one deliver pizza? Why did no one understand that itwas fundamental to the whole nature of pizza that it amved atyour front door in a hot cardboard box? That you slithered it outof greaseproof paper and ate it in folded slices in front of theTV? What was the fundamental flaw in the stupid, stuck-up,sluggardly English that they couldnât grasp this simpleprinciple? For some odd reason it was the one frustration shecould never learn simply to live with and accept, and about oncea month or so she would get very depressed, phone a pizzarestaurant, order the biggest, most lavish pizza she coulddescribe - pizza with an extra pizza on it, essentially - and then,sweetly, ask them to deliver it.
âTo what?â
âDeliver. Let me give you the address - â
âI donât understand. Arenât you going to come and pick itup?â
âNo. Arenât you going to deliver? My address - â âEr, we donât do that, miss.â
âDonât do what?â
âEr, deliver. . .â
âYou donât deliver? Am I hearing you correctly... ?â
The exchange would quickly degenerate into an ugly slangingmatch which would leave her feeling drained and shaky, butmuch, much better the following morning. In all other respectsshe was one of the most sweet-natured people you could hope tomeet.
But today was testing her to the limit.
There had been terrible traffic jams on the motorway, andwhen the distant flash of blue lights made it clear that the causewas an accident somewhere ahead of them Kate had becomemore tense and had stared fixedly out of the other window aseventually they had crawled past it.
The taxi-driver had been bad-tempered when at last he haddropped her off because she didnât have the right money, andthere was a lot of disgruntled hunting through tight trouserpockets before he was eventually able to find change for her.The atmosphere was heavy and thundery and now, standing inthe middle of the main check-in concourse at Terminal Two,Heathrow Airport, she could not find the check-in desk for herflight to Oslo.
She stood very still for a moment, breathing calmly anddeeply and trying not to think of Jean-Philippe.
Jean-Philippe was, as the taxi-driver had correctly guessed,the reason why she was going to Norway, but was also thereason why she was convinced that Norway was not at all agood place for her to go. Thinking of him therefore made herhead oscillate and it seemed best not to think about him at all butsimply to go to Norway as if that was where she happened to begoing anyway. She would then be terribly surprised to bumpinto him at whatever hotel it was he had written on the card thatwas tucked into the side pocket of her handbag.
In fact she would be surprised to find him there anyway.What she would be much more likely to find was a messagefrom him saying that he had been unexpectedly called away toGuatemala, Seoul or Tenerife and that he would call her fromthere. Jean-Philippe was the most continually absent person shehad ever met. In this he was the culmination of a series. Sinceshe had lost Luke to the great yellow Chevrolet she had beenoddly dependent on the rather vacant emotions that a successionof self-absorbed men had inspired in her.
She tried to shut all this out of her mind, and even shut hereyes for a second. She wished that when she opened them againthere would be a sign in front of her saying âThis way forNorwayâ which she could simply follow without needing tothink about it or anything else ever again. This, she reflected, ina continuation of her earlier train of thought, was presumablyhow religions got started, and must be the reason why so manysects hang around airports looking for converts. They know thatpeople there are at their most vulnerable and perplexed, andready to accept any kind of guidance.
Kate opened her eyes again and was, of course, disappointed.But then a second or two later there was a momentary parting ina long surging wave of cross Germans in inexplicable yellowpolo shirts and through it she had a brief glimpse of the check-indesk for Oslo. Lugging her garment bag on to her shoulder, shemade her way towards it.
There was just one other person before her in the line at thedesk and he, it turned out, was having trouble or perhaps makingit.
He was a large man, impressively large and well-built - evenexpertly built - but he was also definitely odd- looking in a waythat Kate couldnât quite deal with. She couldnât even say what itwas that was odd about him, only that she was immediatelyinclined not to include him on her list of things to think about atthe moment. She remembered reading an article which hadexplained that the central processing unit of the human brainonly had seven memory registers, which meant that if you hadseven things in your mind at the same time and then thought ofsomething else, orte of the other seven would instantly drop out.
In quick succession she thought about whether or not she waslikely to catch the plane, about whether it was just herimagination that the day was a particularly bloody one, aboutairline staff who smile charmingly and are breathtakingly rude,about Duty Free shops which are able to charge much lowerprices than ordinary shops but - mysteriously - donât, aboutwhether or not she felt a magazine article about airports comingon which might help pay for the trip, about whether her garmentbag would hurt less on her other shoulder and finally, in spite ofall her intentions to the contrary, about Jean-Philippe, who wasanother set of at lest seven subtopics all to himself.
The man standing arguing in front of her popped right out ofher mind.
It was only the announcement on the airport Tannoy of thelast call for her flight to Oslo which forced her

attention back tothe situation in front of her.
The large man was making trouble about the fact that hehadnât been given a first class seat reservation. It
had justtranspired that the reason for this was that he didnât in fact havea first class ticket.
Kateâs spirits sank to the very bottom of her being and beganto prowl around there making a low growling
noise.
It now transpired that the man in front of her didnât actuallyhave a ticket at all, and the argument then
began to range freelyand angrily over such topics as the physical appearance of theairline :heck-in girl, her qualities as a person, theories about herancestors, speculations as to what surprises the future mighthave in store for her and the airline for which she worked, andfinally lit by chance on the happy subject of the manâs creditcard.
He didnât have one.
Further discussions ensued, and had to do with cheques, andwhy the airline did not accept them.
Kate took a long, slow, murderous look at her watch.
âExcuse me,â she said, interrupting the transactions. âIs thisgoing to take long? I have to catch the Oslo
flight.â
âIâm just dealing with this gentleman,â said the girl, âIâll bewith you in just one second.â
Kate nodded, and politely allowed just one second to go by.
âItâs just that the flightâs about to leave,â she said then. âIhave one bag, I have my ticket, I have a
reservation. Itâll takeabout thirty seconds. I hate to interrupt, but Iâd hate even moreto miss my flight for the sake of thirty seconds. Thatâs thirtyactual seconds, not thirty `just oneâ seconds, which could keepus here all night.â
The check-in girl turned the full glare on her lipgloss on toKate, but before she could speak the large blond man lookedround, and the effect of his face was a little disconcerting.
âI, too,â he said in a slow, angry Nordic voice, âwish to fly toOslo.â
Kate stared at him. He looked thoroughly out of place in anairport, or rather, the airport looked thoroughly out of placearound him.
âWell,â she said, âthe way weâre stacked up at the moment itlooks like neither of us is going to make it. Can we just sort thisone out? Whatâs the hold-up?â
The check-in girl smiled her charming, dead smile and said,âThe airline does not accept cheques, as a matter of companypolicy.â
âWell I do,â said Kate, slapping down her own credit card.âCharge the gentlemanâs ticket to this, and Iâll take a chequefrom him.
âOK?â she added to the big man, who was looking at her withslow surprise. His eyes were large and blue and conveyed theimpression that they had looked at a lot of glaciers in their time.They were extraordinarily arrogant and also muddled.
âOK?â she repeated briskly. âMy name is Kate Schechter.Two `câs, two `hâs, two `eâs and also a `tâ, an `râ and an `sâ.Provided theyâre all there the bank wonât be fussy about theorder they come in. They never seem to know themselves.â
The man very slowly inclined his head a little towards her ina rough bow of acknowledgement. He thanked her for herkindness, courtesy and some Norwegian word that was lost onher, said that it was a long while since he had encounteredanything of the kind, that she was a woman of spirit and someother Norwegian word, and that he was indebted to her. He alsoadded, as an afterthought, that he had no cheque-book.
âRight!â said Kate, determined not to be deflected from hercourse. She fished in her handbag for a piece of paper, took apen from the check-in counter, scribbled on the paper and thrustit at him.
âThatâs my address,â she said, âsend me the money. Hockyour fur coat if you have to. Just send it me. OK? Iâm taking aflyer on trusting you.â
The big man took the scrap of paper, read the few words on itwith immense slowness, then folded it with elaborate care andput it into the pocket of his coat. Again he bowed to her veryslightly.
Kate suddenly realised that the check-in girl was silentlywaiting for her pen back to fill in the credit card form. Shepushed it back at her in annoyance, handed over her own ticketand imposed on herself an icy calm.
The airport Tannoy announced the departure of their flight.
âMay I see your passports, please?â said the girl unhunriedly.
Kate handed hers over, but the big man didnât have one.
âYou what?â exclaimed Kate. The airline girl simply stoppedmoving at all and stared quietly at a random
point on her deskwaiting for someone else to make a move. It wasnât herproblem.
The man repeated angrily that he didnât have a passport. Heshouted it and banged his fist on the counter so

hard that it wasslightly dented by the force of the blow.
Kate picked up her ticket, her passport and her credit card andhoisted her garment bag back up on to her
shoulder.
âThis is when I get off,â she said, and simply walked away.She felt that she had made every effort a
human being couldpossibly be expected to make to catch her plane, but that it wasnot to be. She would send a message to Jean-Philippe saying thatshe could not be there, and it would probably sit in a slot next tohis message to her saying why he could not be there either. Foronce they would be equally absent.
For the time being she would go and cool off. She set off insearch of first a newspaper and then some coffee, and by dint offollowing the appropriate signs was unable to locate either. Shewas then unable to find a working phone from which to send amessage, and decided to give up on the airport altogether. Justget out, she told herself, find a taxi, and go back home.
She threaded her way back across the check-in concourse,and had almost made it to the exit when she happened to glanceback at the check-in desk that had defeated her, and was just intime to see it shoot up through the roof engulfed in a ball oforange flame.
As she lay beneath a pile of rubble, in pain, darkness, andchoking dust, trying to find sensation in her limbs, she was atleast relieved to be able to think that she hadnât merely beenimagining that this was a bad day. So thinking, she passed out.

Dirk Gently 2 - The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul

Chapter 2
The usual people tried to claim responsibility.
First the IRA, then the PLO and the Gas Board. Even BritishNuclear Fuels rushed out a statement to the effect that thesituation was completely under control, that it was a one in amillion chance, that there was hardly any radioactive leakage atall, and that the site of the explosion would make a nice locationfor a day out with the kids and a picnic, before finally having toadmit that it wasnât actually anything to do with them at all.
No cause could be found for the explosion.
It seemed to have happened spontaneously and of its own freewill. Explanations were advanced, but most of these weresimply phrases which restated the problem in different words,along the same principles which had given the world âmetalfatigueâ. In fact, a very similar phrase was invented to accountfor the sudden transition of wood, metal, plastic and concreteinto an explosive condition, which was ânon-linear catastrophicsWctural exasperationâ, or to put it another way - as a juniorcabinet minister did on television the following night in a phrasewhich was to haunt the rest of his career - the check-in desk hadjust got âfundamentally fed up with being where it wasâ.
As in all such disastrous events, estimates of the casualtiesvaried wildly. They started at forty-seven dead, eighty-nineseriously injured, went up to sixty-three dead, a hundred andthirty injured, and rose as high as one hundred and seventeendead before the figures started to be revised downwards oncemore. The final figures revealed that once all the people whocould be accounted for had been accounted for, in fact no onehad been killed at all. A small number of people were in hospitalsuffering from cuts and bruises and varying degrees oftraumatised shock, but that, unless anyone had any informationabout anybody actually being missing, was that.
This was yet another inexplicable aspect to the whole affair.The force of the explosion had been enough to reduce a largepart of the front of Terminal Two to rubble, and yet everyoneinside the building had somehow either fallen very luckily, orbeen shielded from one piece of falling masonry by another, orhad the shock of the explosion absorbed by their luggage. All inall, very little luggage had survived at all. There were questionsasked in Parliament about this, but not very interesting ones.
It was a couple of days before Kate Schechter became awareof any of these things, or indeed of anything at all in the outsideworld.
She passed the time quietly in a world of her own in whichshe was surrounded as far as the eye could see with old cabintrunks full of past memories in which she rummaged with greatcuriosity, and sometimes bewilderment. Or, at least, about atenth of the cabin trunks were full of vivid, and often painful oruncomfortable memories of her past life; the other nine-tenthswere full of penguins, which surprised her. Insofar as sherecognised at all that she was dreaming, she realised that shemust be exploring her own subconscious mind. She had heard itsaid that humans are supposed only to use about a tenth of theirbrains, and that no one was very clear what the other nine-tenthswere for, but she had certainly never heard it suggested that theywere used for storing penguins.
Gradually the trunks, the memories and the penguins began togrow indistinct, to become all white and swimmy, then tobecome like walls that were all white and swimmy, and finallyto become walls that were merely white, or rather a yellowish,greenish kind of off-white, and to enclose her in a small room.
The room was in semi-darkness. A bedside light was on butturned down low, and the light from a street lamp found its waybetween the grey curtains and threw sodium patterns on theopposite wall. She became dimly aware of the shadowed shapeof her own body lying under the white, turned-down sheet andthe pale, neat blankets. She stared at it for a nervous while,checking that it looked right before she tried, tentatively, tomove any part of it. She tried her right hand, and that seemed tobe fine. A little stiff and aching, but the fingers all responded,and all seemed to be of the right length and thickness, and tobend in the right places and in the right directions.
She panicked briefly when she couldnât immediately locateher left hand, but then she found it lying across her stomach andnagging at her in some odd way. It took her a second or two ofconcentration to put together a number of rather disturbingfeelings and realise that there was a needle bandaged into herarm. This shook her quite badly. From the needle there snaked along thin transparent pipe that glistened yellowly in the lightfrom the street lamp and hung in a gentle curl from a thickplastic bag suspended from a tall metal stand. An array ofhorrors briefly assailed her in respect of this apparatus, but shepeered dimly at the bag and saw the words âDextro-Salineâ. Shemade herself calm down again and lay quietly for a fewmoments before continuing her exploration.

Her ribcage seemed undamaged. Bruised and tender, butthere was no shaiper pain anywhere to suggest that anything wasbroken. Her hips and thighs ached and were stiff, but revealedno serious hurt. She flexed the muscles down her right leg andthen her left. She rather fancied that her left ankle was sprained.
In other words, she told herself, she was perfectly all right. Sowhat was she doing here in what she could tell from the septiccolour of the paint was clearly a hospital?
She sat up impatiently, and immediately rejoined the pen-guins for an entertaining few minutes.
The next time she came round she treated herself with a littlemore care, and lay quietly, feeling gently nauseous.
She poked gingerly at her memory of what had happened. Itwas dark and blotchy and came at her in sick, greasy waves likethe North Sea. Lumpy things jumbled themselves out of it andslowly arranged themselves into a heaving airport. The airportwas sour and ached in her head, and in the middle of it, pulsinglike a migraine, was the memory of a momentâs whirling splurgeof light.
It became suddenly very clear to her that the check-inconcourse of Terminal Two at Heathrow Airport had been hit bya meteorite. Silhouetted in the flare was the fur-coated figure ofa big man who must have caught the full force of it and beenreduced instantly to a cloud of atoms that were free to go as theypleased. The thought caused a deep and horrid shudder to gothrough her. He had been infuriating and arrogant, but she hadliked him in an odd way. There had been something oddly noblein his perverse bloody-mindedness. Or maybe, she realised, sheliked to think that such perverse bloody-mindedness was noblebecause it reminded her of herself trying to order pizza to bedelivered in an alien, hostile and non-pizza-delivering world.Nobleness was one word for making a fuss about the trivialinevitabilities of life, but there were others.
She felt a sudden surge of fear and loneliness, but it quicklyebbed away and left her feeling much more composed, relaxed,and wanting to go to the lavatory.
According to her watch it was shortly after three oâclock, andaccording to everything else it was night- time. She shouldprobably call a nurse and let the world know she had comeround. There was a window in the side wall of the room throughwhich she could see a dim corridor in which stood a stretchertrolley and a tall black oxygen bottle, but which was otherwiseempty. Things were very quiet out there.
Peering around her in the small room she saw a white-paintedplywood cupboard, a couple of tubular steel and vinyl chairslurking quietly in the shadows, and a white-painted plywoodbedside cabinet which supported a small bowl with a singlebanana in it. On the other side of the bed stood her drip stand.Set into the wall on that side of the bed was a metal plate with acouple of black knobs and a set of old bakelite headphoneshanging from it, and wound around the tubular side pillar of thebedhead was a cable with a bell push attached to it, which shefingered, and then decided not to push.
She was fine. She could find her own way about.
Slowly, a little woozily, she pushed herself up on to herelbows, and slid her legs out from under the sheets and on to thefloor, which was cold to her feet. She could tell almostimmediately that she shouldnât be doing this because every partof her feet was sending back streams of messages telling herexactly what every tiniest bit of the floor that they touched feltlike, as if it was a strange and worrying thing the like of whichthey had never encountered before. Nevertheless she sat on theedge of the bed and made her feet accept the floor as somethingthey were just going to have to get used to.
Ttte hospital had put her into a large, baggy, striped thing. Itwasnât merely baggy, she decided on examining it more closely,it actually was a bag. A bag of loose blue and white stripedcotton. It opened up the back and let in chilly night draughts.Perfunctory sleeves flopped half-way down her arms. Shemoved her arms around in the light, examining the skin, rubbingit and pinching it, especially around the bandage which held herdrip needle in place. Normally her arms were lithe and the skinwas firm and supple. Tonight, however, they looked like bits ofchickens. Briefly she smoothed each forearm with her otherhand, and then looked up again, purposefully.
She reached out and gripped the drip stand and, because itwobbled slightly less than she did, she was able to use it to pullherself slowly to her feet. She stood there, her tall slim figuretrembling, and after a few seconds she held the drip stand awayat a bent armâs length, like a shepherd holding a crook.
She had not made it to Norway, but she was at least standingup.
The drip stand rolled on four small and independentlyperverse wheels which behaved like four screaming children in asupermarket, but nevertheless Kate was able to propel it to thedoor ahead of her. Walking increased her sense of wooziness,but also increased her resolve not to give in to it. She reachedthe door, opened it, and pushing the drip stand out ahead of her,looked out into the corridor.
To her left the corridor ended in a couple of swing-doors withcircular porthole windows, which seemed to lead into a largerarea, an open ward perhaps. To her right a number of smallerdoors opened off the corridor as

it continued on for a shortdistance before turning a sharp corner. One of those doors wouldprobably be the lavatory. The others? Well, she would find outas she looked for the lavatory.
The first two were cupboards. The third was slightly biggerand had a chair in it and therefor probably counted as a roomsince most people donât like to sit in cupboards, even nurses,who have to do a lot of things that most people wouldnât like to.It also had a stack of styro beakers, a lot of semi-congealedcoffee creamer and an elderly coffee maker, all sitting on top ofa small table together and seeping grimly over a copy of theEvening Standard.
Kate picked up the dark, damp paper and tried to reconstructsome of her missing days from it. However, what with her ownwobbly condition making it difficult to read, and the droopilystuck-together condition of the newspaper, she was able to gleanlittle more than the fact that no one could really say for certainwhat had happened. It seemed that no one had been seriouslyhurt, but that an employee of one of the airlines was stillunaccounted for. The incident had now been officially classifiedas an âAct of Godâ.
âNice one, God,â thought Kate. She put down the remains ofthe paper and closed the door behind her.
The next door she tried was another small side ward like herown. There was a bedside table and a single banana in the fruitbowl.
The bed was clearly occupied. She pulled the door to quickly,but she did not pull it quickly enough. Unfortunately somethingodd had caught her attention, but although she had noticed it,she coutd not immediately say what it was. She stood there withthe door half closed, staring at the door, knowing that she shouldnot look again, and knowing that she would.
Carefully she eased the door back open again.
The room was darkly shadowed and chilly. The chilliness didnot give her a good feeling about the occupant of the bed. Shelistened. The silence didnât sound too good either. It wasnât thesilence of healthy deep sleep, it was the silence of nothing but alittle distant traffic noise.
She hesitated for a long while, silhouetted in the doorway,looking and listening. She wondered about the sheer bulk of theoccupant of the bed and how cold he was with just a thin blanketpulled over him. Next to the bed was a small tubular-leggedvinyl bucket chair which was rather overwhelmed by the hugennd heavy fur coat draped over it, and Kate thought that the coatshould more properly be draped over the bed and its coldoccupant.
At last, walking as softly and cautiously as she could, shemoved into the room and over to the bed. She stood lookingdown at the face of the big, Nordic man. Though cold, andthough his eyes were shut, his face was frowning slightly as ifhe was still rather worried about something. This struck Kate asbeing almost infinitely sad. In life the man had had the air ofsomeone who was beset by huge, if somewhat puzzling,difficulties, and the appearance that he had almost immediatelyfound things beyond this life that were a bother to him as wellwas miserable to contemplate.
She was astonished that he appeared to be so unscathed. Hisskin was totally unmarked. It was rugged and healthy - or ratherhad been healthy until very recently. Closer inspection showed anetwork of fine lines which suggested that he was older than themid-thirties she had originally assumed. He could even havebeen a very fit and healthy man in his late forties.
Standing against the wall, by the door, was somethingunexpected. It was a large Coca-Cola vending machine. It didnâtlook as if it had been installed there: it wasnât plugged in and ithad a small neat sticker on it explaining that it was temporarilyout of order. It looked as if it had simply been left thereinadvenently by someone who was probably even now walkingaround wondering which room he had left it in. Its large red andwhite wavy panel stared glassily into the room and did notexplain itself. The only thing the machine communicated to theoutside world was that there was a slot into which coins of avariety of denominations might be inserted, and an aperture towhich a variety of different cans would be delivered if themachine was working, which it was not. There was also an oldsledge-hammer leaning against it which was, in its own way,odd.
Faintness began to creep over Kate, the room began todevelop a slight spin, and there was some restless rustling in thecabin trunks of her mind.
Then she realised that the rustling wasnât simply herimagination. There was a distinct noise in the room - a heavy,beating, scratching noise, a muffled fluttering. The noise roseand fell like the wind, but in her dazed and woozy state, Katecould not at first tell where the noise was coming from. At lasther gaze fell on the curtains. She stared at them with the worriedfrown of a drunk trying to work out why the door is dancing.The sound was coming from the curtains. She walkeduncertainly towards them and pulled them apart. A huge eaglewith circles tattooed on its wings was clattering and beatingagainst the window, staring in with great yellow eyes andpecking wildly at the glass.

Kate staggered back, turned and tried to heave herself out ofthe room. At the end of the corridor the porthole doors swungopen and two figures came through them. Hands rushed towardsher as she became hopelessly entangled in the drip stand andbegan slowly to spin towards the floor.
She was unconscious as they carefully laid her back in herbed. She was unconscious half an hour later when a disturbinglyshort figure in a worryingly long white doctorâs coat arrived,wheeled the big man away on a stretcher trolley and thenreturned after a few minutes for the Coca-Cola machine.
She woke a few hours later with a wintry sun seeping throughthe window. The day looked very quiet and ordinary, but Katewas still shaking.

Dirk Gently 2 - The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul

Chapter 3
The same sun later broke in through the upper windows of ahouse in North London and struck the peacefully sleeping figureof a man.
The room in which he slept was large and bedraggled and didnot much benefit from the sudden intrusion of light. The suncrept slowly across the bedclothes, as if nervous of what it mightfind amongst them, slunk down the side of the bed, moved in arather startled way across some objects it encountered on thefloor, toyed nervously with a couple of motes of dust, lit brieflyon a stuffed fruitbat hanging in the corner, and fled.
This was about as big an appearance as the sun ever put inhere, and it lasted for about an hour or so, during which time thesleeping figure scarcely stirred.
At eleven oâclock the phone rang, and still the figure did notrespond, any more than it had responded when the phone hadrung at twenty-five to seven in the morning, again at twenty toseven, again at ten to seven, and again for ten minutescontinuously starting at five to seven, after which it has settledinto a long and significant silence, disturbed only by the brayingof police sirens in a nearby street at around nine oâclock, thedelivery of a large eighteenth-century dual manual harpsichordat around nine-fifteen, and the collection of same by bailiffs at alittle after ten. This was a not uncommon sort of occurrence-the people concerned were accustomed to finding the key underthe doormat, and the man in the bed was accustomed to sleepingthrough it. You would probably not say that he was sleeping thesleep of the just, unless you meant the just asleep, but it wascertainly the sleep of someone who was not fooling about whenhe climbed into bed of a night and turned off the light.
The room was not a room to elevate the soul. Louis XIV, topick a name at random, would not have liked it, would havefound it not sunny enough, and insufficiently full of mirrors. Hewould have desired someone to pick up the socks, put therecords away, and maybe burn the place down. Michelangelowould have been distressed by its proponions, which wereneither lofty nor shaped by any noticeable inner harmony orsymmetry, other than that all parts of the room were pretty muchequally full of old coffee mugs, shoes and brimming ashtrays,most of which were now sharing their tasks with each other. Thewalls were painted in almost precisely that shade of green whichRaffaello Sanzio would have bitten off his own right hand at thewrist rather than use, and Hercules, on seeing the room, wouldprobably have returned half an hour later armed with a navigableriver. It was, in short, a dump, and was likely to remain so for aslong as it remained in the custody of Mr Svlad, or âDirkâ,Gently, n Cjelli.
At last Gently stirred.
The sheets and blankets were pulled up tightly around hishead, but from somewhere half way down the length of the beda hand slowly emerged from under the bedclothes and its fingersfelt their way in little tapping movements along the floor.Working from experience, they neatly circumvented a bowl ofsornething very nasty that had been sitting there sinceMichaelmas, and eventually happened upon a half-empty packof untipped Gauloises and a box of matches. The fingers shook acrumpled white tube free of the pack, seized it and the box ofmatches, and then started to poke a way through the sheetstangled together at the top of the bed, like a magician proddingat a handkerchief from which he intends to release a flock ofdoves.
The cigarette was at last inserted into the hole. The cigarettewas lit. For a while the bed itself appeared to be smoking thecigarette in great heaving drags. It coughed long, loud andshudderingly and then began at last to breathe in a moremeasured rhythm. In this way, Dirk Gently achievedconsciousness.
He lay there for a while feeling a terrible sense of worry andguilt about something weighing on his shoulders. He wished hecould forget about it, and promptly did. He levered himself outof bed and a few minutes later padded downstairs.
The mail on the doormat consisted of the usual things: a rudeletter threatening to take away his American Express card, aninvitation to apply for an American Express card, and a few billsof the more hysterical and unrealistic type. He couldnâtunderstand why they kept sending them. The cost of the postageseemed merely to be good money thrown after bad. He shookhis head in wonderment at the malevolent incompetence of theworld, threw the mail away, entered the kitchen and approachedthe fridge with caution.
It stood in the corner.
The kitchen was large and shrouded in a deep gloom that wasnot relieved, only turned yellow, by the action of switching onthe light. Dirk squatted down in front of the fridge and carefullyexamined the edge of the door. He found what he was lookingfor. In fact he found more than he was looking for.
Near the bottom of the door, across the narrow gap whichseparated the door from the main body of the fridge, which heldthe strip of grey insulating rubber, lay a single human hair. Itwas stuck there with dried

saliva. That he had expected. He hadstuck it there himself three days earlier and had checked it onseveral occasions since then. What he had not expected to finewas a second hair.
He frowned at it in alarm. A second hair?
It was stuck across the gap in the same way as the first one,only this hair was near the top of the fridge door, and he had notput it there. He peered at it closely, and even went so far as to goand open the old shutters on the kitchen windows to let someextra light in upon the scene.
The daylight shouldered its way in like a squad of poiicemen,and did a lot of whatâs-all-thising around the room which, likethe bedroom, would have presented anyone of an aestheticdisposition with difficulties. Like most of the rooms in Dirkâshouse it was large, looming and utterly dishevelled. It simplysneered at anyoneâs attempts to tidy it, sneered at them andbrushed them aside like one of the small pile of dead anddisheartened flies that lay beneath the window, on top of a pileof old pizza boxes.
The light revealed the second hair for what it was - a greyhair at root, dyed a vivid metallic orange. Dirk pursed his lipsand thought very deeply. He didnât need to think hard in order torealise who the hair belonged to - there was only one personwho regularly entered the kitchen looking as if her head hadbeen used for extracting metal oxides from industrial waste - buthe did have seriously to consider the implications of thediscovery that she had been plastering her hair across the door ofhis fridge.
It meant that the silently waged conflict between himself andhis cleaning lady had escalated to a new and more frighteninglevel. It was now, Dirk reckoned, fully three months since thisfridge door had been opened, and each of them was grimlydetermined not to be the one to open it first. The fridge no longermerely stood there in the comer of the kitchen, it actuallylurked. Dirk could quite clearly remember the day on which thething had started lurking. It was about a week ago, when Dirkhad tried a simple subterfuge to trick Elena - the old batâs namewas Elena, pronounced to rhyme with cleaner, which was anirony that Dirk now no longer relished - into opening the fridgedoor. The subterfuge had been deftly deflected and had nearlyrebounded horribly on Dirk.
He had resorted to the strategy of going to the localmini-market to buy a few simple groceries. Nothing contentious- a little milk, some eggs, some bacon, a carton or two ofchocolate custard and a simple half-pound of butter. He had leftthem, innocently, on top of the fridge as if to say, âOh, whenyou have a moment, perhaps you could pop these inside...â
When he had returned that evening his heart bounded to seethat they were no longer on top of the fridge. They were gone!They had not been merely moved aside or put on a shelf, theywere nowhere to be seen. She must finally have capitulated andput them away. In the fridge. And she would surely havecleaned it out once it was actually open. For the first and onlytime his heart swelled with warmth and gratitude towards her,and he was about to fling open the door of the thing in relief andtriumph when an eighth sense (at the last count, Dirk reckonedhe had eleven) warned him to be very, very careful, and toconsider first where Elena might have put the cleared outcontents of the fridge.
A nameless doubt gnawed at his mind as he movednoiselessly towards the garbage bin beneath the sink. Holdinghis breath, he opened the lid and looked.
There, nestling in the folds of the fresh black bin liner, werehis eggs, his bacon, his chocolate custard and his simplehalf-pound of butter. Two milk bottles stood rinsed and neatlylined up by the sink into which their contents had presumablybeen poured.
She had thrown it away.
Rather than open the fridge door, she had thrown his foodaway. He looked round slowly at the grimy, squat, whitemonolith, and that was the exact moment at which he realisedwithout a shadow of a doubt that his fridge had now begunseriously to lurk.
He made himself a stiff black coffee and sat, slightlytrembling. He had not even looked directly at the sink, but heknew that he must unconsciously have noticed the two cleanmilk bottles there, and some busy part of his mind had beenalarmed by them.
The next day he had explained all this away to himself. Hewas becoming needlessly paranoiac. It had surely been aninnocent or careless mistake on Elenaâs part. She had probablybeen brooding distractedly on her sonâs attack of bronchitispeevishness or homosexuality or whatever it was that regularlyprevented her from either turning up, or from having noticeableeffect when she did. She was Italian and probably hadabsent- mindedly mistaken his food for garbage.
But the business with the hair changed all that. It establishedbeyond all possible doubt that she knew exactly what she wasdoing. She was under no circumstamces going to open the fridgedoor until he had opened it first, and he was under nocircumstances going to open the fridge until she had.
Obviously she had not noticed his hair, otherwise it wouldhave been her most effective course simply to

pull it off, thustricking him into thinking she had opened the fridge. He shuuldpresumably now remove her hair in the hope of pulling thatsame trick on her, but even as he sat there he knew thatsomehow that wouldnât work, and that they were locked into atightening spiral of non-fridge-opening that would lead themboth to madness or perdition.
He wondered if he could hire someone to come and open thefridge.
No. He was not in a position to hire anybody to do anything.He was not even in a position to pay Elena for the last threeweeks. The only reason he didnât ask her to leave was thatsacking somebody inevitably involved paying them off, and thishe was in no position to do. His secretary had finally left him onher own initiative and gone off to do something reprehensible inthe travel business. Dirk had attempted to cast scon on herpreferring monotony of pay over-
âRegularity of pay,â she had calmly corrected him.
- over job satisfaction.
She had nearly said, âOver what?â, but at that moment sherealised that if she said that she would have to
listen to his reply,which would be bound to infuriate her into arguing back. Itoccurred to her for the first time that the only way of escapingwas just not to get drawn into these arguments. If she simply didnot respond this time, then she was free to leave. She tried it.She felt a sudden freedom. She left. A week later, in much thesame mood, she married an airline cabin steward called Smith.
Dirk had kicked her desk over, and then had to pick it uphimself later when she didnât come back.
The detective business was currently as brisk as the tomb.Nobody, it seemed, wished to have anything detected. He hadrecently, to make ends meet, taken up doing palmistry in drag onThursday evenings, but he wasnât comfortable with it. He couldhave withstood it - the hateful, abject humiliation of it all wassomething to which he had, in different ways, now becomeaccustomed, and he was quite anonymous in his little tent in theback garden of the pub - he could have withstood it all if hehadnât been so horribly, excruciatingly good at it. It made himbreak out in a sweat of self loathing. He tried by every means tocheat, to fake, to be deliberately and cynically bad, but whateverfakery he tried to introduce always failed and he invariablyended up being right.
His worst moment had come about as a result of the poorwoman from Oxfordshiie who had come in to see him oneevening. Being in something of a waggish mood, he hadsuggested that she should keep an eye on her husband, who,judging by her mamage line, looked to be a bit of a flighty type.It transpired that her husband was in fact a fighter pilot, and thathis plane had been lost in an exerrise over the North Sea only afortnight earlier.
Dirk had been flustered by this and had soothedmeaninglessly at her. He was certain, he said, that her husbandwould be restored to her in the fullness of time, that all would bewell, and that all manner of things would be well and so on. Thewoman said that she thought this was not very likely seeing asthe world record for staying alive in the North Sea was ratherless than an hour, and since no trace of her husband had beenfound in two weeks it seemed fanciful to imagine that he wasanything other than stone dead, and she was trying to get used tothe idea, thank you very much. She said it rather tartly.
Dirk had lost all control at this point and started to babble.
He said that it was very clear from reading her hands that thegreat sum of money she had coming to her would be noconsolation to her for the loss of her dear, dear husband, but thatat least it might comfort her to know that he had gone on to thatgreat something or other in the sky, that he was floating on thefleeciest of white clouds, looking very handsome in his new setof wings, and that he was terribly sorry to be talking suchappalling drivel but she had caught him rather by surprise.Would she care for some tea, or some vodka, or some soup?
The woman demurred. She said she had only wandered intothe tent by accident, she had been looking for the lavatories, andwhat was that about the money?
âComplete gibberish,â Dirk had explained. He was in greatdifficulties, what with having the falsetto to keep up. âI wasmaking it up as I went along,â he said. âPlease allow me totender my most profound apologies for intruding so clumsily onyour private grief, and to escort you to, er, or rather, direct youto the, well, what I can only in the circumstances call thelavatory, which is out of the tent and on the left.â
Dirk had been cast down by this encounter, but was thenutterly horrified a few days later when he discovered that thevery following morning the unfonunate woman had learnt thatshe had won ?250,000 on the Premium Bonds. He spent severalhours that night standing on the roof of his house, shaking hisfist at the dark sky and shouting, âStop it!â until a neighbourcomplained to the police that he couldnât sleep. The police hadcome round in a screaming squad car and woken up the rest ofthe neighbourhood as well.
Today, this morning, Dirk sat in his kitchen and stareddejectedly at his fridge. The bloody-minded

ebullience which heusually relied on to carry him through the day had been knockedout of him in its very opening moments by the business with thefridge. His will sat imprisoned in it, locked up by a single hair.
What he needed, he thought, was a client. Please, God, hethought, if there is a god, any god, bring me a client. Just asimple client, the simpler the better. Credulous and rich.Someone like that chap yesterday. He tapped his fingers on thetable.
The problem was that the more credulous the client, the moreDirk fell foul at the end of his own better nature, which wasconstantly rearing up and embarrassing him at the mostinopportune moments. Dirk frequently threatened to hurl hisbetter nature to the ground and kneel on its windpipe, but itusually managed to get the better of him by dressing itself up asguilt and self loathing, in which guise it could throw him rightout of the ring.
Credulous and rich. Just so that he could pay off some,perhaps even just one, of the more prominent and sensationalbills. He lit a cigarette. The smoke curled upwards in themoming light and attached itself to the ceiling.
Like that chap yesterday. . .
He paused.
The chap yesterday. . .
The world held its breath.
Quietly and gently there settled on him the knowledge thatsomething, somewhere, was ghastly. Something
was terriblywrong. There was a disaster hanging silently in the air around himwaiting for him to notice it. His knees tingled. What he needed, he had been thinking, was a client. He hadbeen thinking that as a matter of habit. It was what he alwaysthought at this time of the morning. What he had forgotten wasthat he had one. He stared wildly at his watch. Nearly eleven-thirty. He shookhis head to try and clear the silent ringing between his ears, thenmade a hysterical lunge for his hat and his great leather coat thathung behind the door. Fifteen seconds later he left the house, five hours late butmoving fast.

Dirk Gently 2 - The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul

Chapter 4
A minute or two later Dirk paused to consider his best strategy.Rather than arrive five hours late and flustered it would be betterall round if he were to arrive five hours and a few extra minuteslate, but triumphantly in command.
âPray God I am not too soon!â would be a good opening lineas he swept in, but it needed a good follow- through as well, andhe wasnât sure what it should be.
Perhaps it would save time if he went back to get his car, butthen again it was only a short distance, and he had a tremendouspropensity for getting lost when driving. This was largelybecause of his method of âZenâ navigation, which was simply tofind any car that looked as if it knew where it was going andfollow it. The results were more often surprising than successful,but he felt it was worth it for the sake of the few occasions whenit was both.
Furthermore he was not at all certain that his car was working.
It was an elderly Jaguar, built at that very special time in thecompanyâs history when they were making cars which had tostop for repairs more often than they needed to stop for petrol,and frequently needed to rest for months between outings. Hewas, however, certain, now that he came to think about it, thatthe car didnât have any petrol and furthermore he did not haveany cash or valid plastic to enable him to fill it up.
He abandoned that line of thought as wholly fruitless.
He stopped to buy a newspaper while he thought things over.The clock in the newsagentâs said eleven thirty-five. Damndamn, damn. He toyed with the idea of simply dropping thecase. Just walking away and forgetting about it. Having somelunch. The whole thing was fraught with difficulties in anyevent. Or rather it was fraught with one particular difficultywhich was that of keeping a straight face. The whole thing wascomplete and utter nonsense. The client was clearly loopy andDirk would not have considered taking the case except for onevery important thing.
Three hundred pounds a day plus expenses.
The client had agreed to it just like that. And when Dirk hadstarted his usual speech to the effect that his methods, involvingas they did the fundamental interconnectedness of all things,often led to expenses that might appear to the untutored eye tobe somewhat tangential to the matter in hand, the client hadsimply waved the matter aside as trifling. Dirk liked that in aclient.
The only thing the client had insisted upon in the midst of thisalmost superhuman fit of reasonableness was that Dirk had to bethere, absolutely had, had, had to be there ready, functioning andalert, without fail, without even the merest smidgen of an inklingof failure, at six-thirty in the morning. Absolute.
Well, he was just going to have to see reason about that aswell. Six-thirty was clearly a preposterous time and he, theclient, obviously hadnât meant it seriously. A civilised six-thirtyfor twelve noon was almost certainly what he had in mind, andif he wanted to cut up rough about it, Dirk would have no optionbut to start handing out some serious statistics. Nobody gotmurdered before lunch. But nobody. People werenât up to it.You needed a good lunch to get both the blood-sugar and blood-lust levels up. Dirk had the figures to prove it.
Did he, Anstey (the clientâs name was Anstey, an odd, intenseman in his mid-thirties with staring eyes, a narrow yellow tieand one of the big houses in Lupton Road; Dirk hadnât actuallyliked him very much and thought he looked as if he was tryingto swallow a fish), did he know that 67 per cent of all knownmurderers, who expressed a preference, had had liver and baconfor lunch? And that another 22 per cent had been torn betweeneither a prawn biryani or an omelette? That dispensed with 89per cent of the threat at a stroke, and by the time you had furtherdiscounted the salad eaters and the turkey and ham sandwichmunchers and started to look at the number of people whowould contemplate such a course of action without any lunch atall, then you were well into the realms of negligibility andbordering on fantasy.
After two-thirty, but nearer to three oâclock, was when youhad to start being on your guard. Seriously. Even on good days.Even when you werenât receiving death threats from strangegigantic men with green eyes, you had to watch people like ahawk after the lunching hour. The really dangerous time wasafter four oâclockish, when the streets began to fill up withmarauding packs of publishers and agents, maddened withfettucine and kir and baying for cabs. Those were the times thattested menâs souls. Six-thirty in the morning? Forget it. Dirkhad.
With his resolve well stiffened Dirk stepped back out of thenewsagentâs into the nippy air of the street and strode off.
âAh, I expect youâll be wanting to pay for that paper, then,wonât you, Mr Dirk, sir?â said the newsagent, trotting gentlyafter him.

âAh, Bates,â said Dirk loftily, âyou and your expectations.Always expecting this and expecting that. May I recommendserenity to you? A life that is burdened with expectations is aheavy life. Its fruit is sorrow and disappointment. Learn to beone with the joy of the moment.â
âI thirtk itâs twenty pence that one, sir,â said Bates, tranquilly.
âTell you what Iâll do, Bates, seeing as itâs you. Do you havea pen on you at all? A simple ball-point will suffice.â
Bates produced one from an inner pocket and handed it toDirk, who then tore off the corner of the paper on which theprice was printed and scribbled âIOUâ above it. He handed thescrap of paper to the newsagent.
âShall I put this with the others, then, sir?â
âPut it wherever it will give you the greatest joy, dear Bates, Iwould want you to put it nowhere less. For now, dear man,farewell.â
âI expect youâll be wanting to give me back my pen as wellMr Dirk.â
âWhen the times are propitious for such a transaction, mydear Bates,â said Dirk, âyou may depend upon it. For themoment, higher purposes call it. Joy, Bates, great joy. Bates,please let go of it.â
After one last listless tug, the little man shrugged and paddedback towards his shop.
âI expect Iâll be seeing you later, then, Mr Dirk,â he calledout over his shoulder, without enthusiasm.
Dirk gave a gracious bow of his head to the manâs retreatingback, and then hurried on, opening the
newspaper at thehoroscope page as he did so.
âVirtually evervthing you decide today will be wrong,â it saidbluntly.
Dirk slapped the paper shut with a grunt. He did not for asecond hold with the notion that great whirling
lumps of rocklight years away knew something about your day that youdidnât. It just so happened that âThe Great Zaganzaâ was an oldfriend of his who knew when Dirkâs birthday was, and alwayswrote his column deliberately to wind him up. The paperâscirculation had dropped by nearly a twelfth since he had takenover doing the horoscope, and only Dirk and The Great Zaganzaknew why.
He hurried on, flapping his way quickly through the rest ofthe paper. As usual, there was nothing interesting. A lot of stuffabout the search for Janice Smith, the missing airline girl fromHeathrow, and how she could possibly have disappeared justlike that. They printed the latest picture of her, which was on aswing with pigtails, aged six. Her father, a Mr Jim Pearce, wasquoted as saying it was quite a good likeness, but she had grownup a lot now and was usually in better focus. Impatiently, Dirktucked the paper under his arm and strode onwards, his thoughtson a much more interesting topic.
Three hundred pounds a day. Plus expenses.
He wondered how long he could reasonably expect to sustainin Mr Anstey his strange delusions that he was about to bemurdered by a seven foot tall, shaggy-haired creature with hugegreen eyes and horns, who habitually waved things at him: acontract written in some incomprehensible language and signedwith a splash of blood, and also a kind of scythe. The othernotable feature of this creature was that no one other than his cli- ent had been able to see it, which Mr Anstey dismissed as a trickof the light.
Three days? Four? Dirk didnât think heâd be able to manage awhole week with a straight face, but he was already looking atsomething like a grand for his trouble. And he would stick a newfridge down on the list of tangential but non-negotiableexpenses. That would be a good one. Getting the old fridgethrown out was definitely part of the interconnectedness of allthings.
He began to whistle at the thought of simply getting someoneto come round and cart the thing away, turned into Lupton Roadand was surprised at all the police cars there. And theambulance. He didnât like them being there. It didnât feel right.It didnât sit comfortably in his mind alongside his visions of anew fridge.

Dirk Gently 2 - The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul

Chapter 5
Dirk knew Lupton Road. It was a wide tree-lined affair, withlarge late-Victorian terraces which stood tall and sturdily andresented police cars. Resented them if they tumed up innumbers, that is, and if their lights were flashing. Theinhabitants of Lupton Road liked to see a nice, well-turned-outsingle police car patrolling up and down the street in a cheerfuland robust manner - it kept property values cheerful and robusttoo. But the moment the lights started flashing in thatknuckle-whitening blue, they cast their pallor not only on theneatly pointed bricks that they flashed across, but also on thevery values those bricks represented.
Anxious faces peered from behind the glass of neighbouringwindows, and were irradiated by the blue strobes.
There were three of them, three police cars left askew acrossthe road in a way that transcended mere parking. It sent out amassive signal to the world saying that the law was here nowtaking charge of things, and that anyone who just had normal,good and cheerful business to conduct in Lupton Road could justfuck off.
Dirk hurried up the road, sweat pricking at him beneath hisheavy leather coat. A police constable loomed up ahead of himwith his arms spread out, playing at being a stop barrier, butDirk swept him aside in a torrent of words to which theconstable was unable to come up with a good response off thetop of his head. Dirk sped on to the house.
At the door another policeman stopped him, and Dirk wasabout to wave an expired Marks and Spencer charge card at himwith a deft little flick of the wrist that he had practised for hoursin front of a mirror on those long evenings when nothing muchelse was on, when the officer suddenly said, âHey, is your nameGently?â
Dirk blinked at him warily. He made a slight grunting noisethat could be either âyesâ or ânoâ depending on thecircumstances.
âBecause the Chief has been looking for you.â
âHas he?â said Dirk.
âI recognised you from his description,â said the officerlooking him up and down with a slight smirk.
âIn fact,â continued the officer, âheâs been using your namein a manner that some might find highly
offensive. He even sentBig Bob the Finder off in a car to find you. I can tell that hedidnât find you from the fact that youâre looking reasonablywell. Lot of people get found by Big Bob the Finder, they comein a bit wobbly. Just about able to help us with our enquiries butthatâs about all. Youâd better go in. Rather you than me,â headded quietly.
Dirk glanced at the house. The stripped-pine shutters wereclosed across all the windows. Though in all other respects thehouse seemed well cared for, groomed into a state of clean,well-pointed aftluence, the closed shutters seemed to convey anair of sudden devastation.
Oddly, there seemed to be music coming from the basement,or rather, just a single disjointed phrase of thumping musicbeing repeated over and over again. It sounded as if the stylushad got stuck in the groove of a record, and Dirk wondered whyno one had turned it off, or at least nudged the stylus along sothat the record could continue. The song seemed very vaguelyfamiliar and Dirk guessed that he had probably heard it on theradio recently, though he couldnât place it. The fragment of lyricseemed to be something like:
âDonât pick it up, pick it up, pick i-
âDonât pick it up, pick it up, pick i-
âDonât pick it up, pick it up, pick i - â and so on.
âYouâll be wanting to go down to the basement,â said theofficer impassively, as if that was the last thing
that anyone intheir right mind would be wanting to do.
Dirk nodded to him curtly and hurried up the steps to thefront door, which was standing slightly ajar. He
shook his headand clenched his shoulders to try and stop his brain fluttering. He went in.
The hallway spoke of prosperity imposed on a taste that hadoriginally been formed by student living. The floors werestripped boards heavily polyurethaned, the walls white withGreek rugs hung on them, but expensive Greek rugs. Dirk wouldbe prepared to bet (though probably not to pay up) that athorough search of the house would reveal, amongst who knewwhat other dark secrets, five hundred British Telecom shares anda set of Dylan albums that was complete up to Blood on theTracks.
Another policeman was standing in the hall. He lookedterribly young, and he was leaning very slightly back against thewall, staring at the floor and holding his helmet against hisstomach. His face was pale and shiny. He looked at Dirkblankly, and nodded faintly in the direction of the stairs leadingdown.
Up the stairs came the repeated sound:

âDonât pick it up, pick it up, pick i-
âDonât pick it up, pick it up, pick i-â
Dirk was trembling with a rage that was barging aroundinside him loooking for something to hit or
throttle. He wishedthat he could hotly deny that any of this was his fault, but untilanybody tried to assert that it was, he couldnât.
âHow long have you been here?â he said curtly.
The young policeman had to gather himself together toanswer.
âWe arrived about half-hour ago,â he replied in a thick voice.âHell of a morning. Rushing around.â
âDonât tell me about rushing around,â said Dirk, completelymeaninglessly. He launched himself down the
stars.
âDonât pick it up, pick it up, pick i-
âDonât pick it up, pick it up, pick i-â
At the bottom there was a narrow corridor. The main door offit was heavily cracked and hanging off its
hinges. It opened intoa large double room. Dirk was about to enter when a figureemerged from it and stood barring his way.
âI hate the fact that this case has got you mixed up in it,â saidthe figure, âI hate it very much. Tell me what youâve got to dowith it so I know exactly what it is Iâm hating.â
Dirk stared at the neat, thin face in astonishment.
âGilks?â he said.
âDonât stand there looking like a startled whatsisname, whatare those things what arenât seals? Much
worse than seals. Bigblubbery things. Dugongs. Donât stand there looking like astartled dugong. Why has that...â Gilks pointed into the roombehind him, âwhy has that. . .man in there got your name andteIephone number on an envelope full uf money?â
âHow m...â started Dirk. âHow, may I ask, do you come tobe here, Gilks? What are you doing so far from the Fens?Surprised you find it dank enough for you here.â
âThree hundred pounds,â said Gilks. âWhy?â
âPerhaps you would allow me to speak to my client,â saidDirk.
âYour client, eh?â said Gilks grimly. âYes. All right. Whydonât you speak to him? Iâd be interested to hear
what you haveto say.â He stood back stiffly, and waved Dirk into the room.
Dirk gathered his thoughts and entered the room in a state ofcontrolled composure which lasted for just
over a second.
Most of his client was sitting quietly in a comfortable chair infront of the hi-fi. The chair was placed in the
optimal listeningposition - about twice as far back from the speakers as thedistance between them, which is generally considered to be idealfor stereo imaging.
He seemed generally to be casual and relaxed with his legscrossed and a half-finished cup of coffee on the small tablebeside him. Distressingly, though, his head was sitting neatly onthe middle of the record which was revolving on the hi-fiturntable, with the tone arm snuggling up against the neck andconstantly being deflected back into the same groove. As thehead revolved it seemed once every 1.8 seconds or so to shootDirk a reproachful glance, as if to say, âSee what happens whenyou donât turn up on time like I asked you to,â then it wouldsweep on round to the wall, round, round, and back to the frontagain with more reproach.
âDonât pick it up, pick it up, pick i-
âDonât pick it up, pick it up, pick i-â
The room swayed a little around Dirk, and he put his hand outagainst the wall to steady it.
âWas there any particular service you were engaged toprovide for your client?â said Gilks behind him,
very quietly.
âOh, er, just a small matter,â said Dirk weakly. âNothingconnected with all this. No, he, er, didnât mention
any of thiskind of thing at all. Well, look, I can see youâre busy, I think Iâdbetter just collect my fee and leave. You say he left it out forme?â
Having said this, Dirk sat heavily on a small bentwood chairstanding behind him, and broke it.
Gilks hauled him back to his feet again, and propped himagainst the wall. Briefly he left the room, then came back with asmall jug of water and a glass on a tray. He poured some waterinto the glass, took it to Dirk and threw it at him.
âBetter?â
âNo,â spluttered Dirk, âcanât you at least turn the record off?â
âThatâs forensicâs job. Canât touch anything till the cleverdicks have been. Maybe thatâs them now. Go
out on to the patioand get some air. Chain yourself to the railing and beat yourselfup a little, Iâm pushed for

time myself. And try to look lessgreen, will you? Itâs not your colour.â
âDonât pick it up, pick it up, pick i-
âDonât pick it up, pick it up, pick i-â
Gilks turned round, looking tired and cross, and was about togo out and up the stairs to meet the
newcomers whose voicescould be heard up on the ground floor, when he paused andwatched the head revolving patiently on its heavy platter for afew seconds.
âYou know,â he said at last, âthese smart-alec show-offsuicides really make me tired. They only do it to annoy.â
âSuicide?â said Dirk.
Gilks glanced round at him.
âWindows secured with iron bars half an inch thick,â he said.âDoor locked from the inside with the key
still in the lock.Furniture piled against the inside of the door. French windows tothe patio locked with mortice door bolts. No signs of a tunnel. Ifit was murder then the murderer must have stopped to do a damnfine job of glazing on the way out. Except that all the puttyâs oldnnd painted over.
âNo. Nobodyâs left this room, and nobodyâs broken into itexcept for us, and Iâm pretty sure we didnât do it.
âI havenât time to fiddle around on this one. Obviouslysuicide; and just done to be difficult. Iâve half a mind to do thedeceased for wasting police time. Tell you what,â he said,glancing at his watch, âyouâve got ten minutes. If you come upwith a plausible explanation of how he did it that I can put in myreport, Iâll let you keep the evidence in the envelope minus 20per cent compensation to me for the emotional wear and tearinvolved in not punching you in the mouth.â
Dirk wondered for a moment whether or not to mention thevisits his client claimed to have received from a strange andviolent green-eyed, fur-clad giant who regularly emerged out ofnowhere bellowing about contracts and obligations and waving athree foot glittering-edged scythe, but decided, on balance, no.
âDonât pick it up, pick it up, pick i-
âDonât pick it up, pick it up, pick i-â
He was seething at himself at last. He had not been able toseethe at himself properly over the death of his
client because itwas too huge and horrific a burden to bear. But now he had beenhumiliated by Gilks, and found himself in too wobbly anddisturbed a state to fight back, so he was able to seethe athimself about that.
He turned sharply away from his tormentor and let himselfout into the patio garden to be alone with his seethings.
The patio was a small, paved, west-facing area at the rearwhich was largely deprived of light, cut off as it was by the highback wall of the house and by the high wall of some industrialbuilding that backed on to the rear. In the middle of it stood, forwho knew what possible reason, a stone sundial. If any light ataIl fell on the sundial you would know that it was pretty close tonoon, GMT. Other than that, birds perched on it. A few plantssulked in pots.
Dirk jabbed a cigarette in his mouth and burnt a lot of the endof it fiercely.
âDonât pick it up, pick it up, pick i-
âDonât pick it up, pick it up, pick i-â still nagged frominside the house.
Neat garden walls separated the patio on either side trom thegardens of neighbouring houses. The one to
the left was thesame size as this one, the one to the right extended a littlefurther, benefiting from the fact that the industrial buildingfinished flush with the intervening garden wall. There was an airof well-kemptness. Nothing grand, nothing flashy, just a sensethat all was well and that upkeep on the houses was no problem.The house to the right, in particular, looked as if it had had itsbrickwork repointed quite recently, and its windows reglossed.
Dirk took a large gulp of air and stood for a second staring upinto what could be seen of the sky, which was grey and hazy. Asingle dark speck was wheeling against the underside of theclouds. Dirk watched this for a while, glad of any focus for histhoughts other than the horrors of the room he had just left. Hewas vaguely aware of comings and goings within the room, of acertain amount of tape-measuring happening, of a feeling thatphotographs were being taken, and that severed-head-removalactivities were taking place.
âDonât pick it up, pick it up, pick i-
âDonât pick it up, pick it up, pick i-
âDonât pi - â
Somebody at last picked it up, the nagging repetition was atlast hushed, and now the gentle sound of a
distant televisionfloated peacefully on the noontime air.
Dirk, however, was having a great deal of difficulty in takingit all in. He was much more aware of taking a

succession ofhuge swimmy whacks to the head, which were the assaults ofguilt. It was not the normal background-noise type of guilt thatcomes from just being alive this far into the twentieth century,and which Dirk was usually fairly adept at dealing with. It wasan actual stunning sense of, âthis specific terrible thing isspecifically and terribly my faultâ. All the normal mental moveswouldnât let him get out of the path of the huge pendulum.Wham it came again, whizz, wham, again and again, whamwham, wham.
He tried to remember any of the details of what his late client(wham, wham) had said (wham) to him (wham), but it was(wham) virtually impossible (wham) with all this whammingtaking place (wham). The man had said (wham) that (Dirk took adeep breath) (wham) he was being pursued (wham) by (wham) alarge, hairy, green-eyed monster armed with a scythe.
Wham!
Dirk had secretly smiled to himself about this.
Whim, wham, whim, wham, whim, wham!
And had thought, âWhat a silly man.â
Whim, whim, whim, whim, wham!
A scythe (whom), and a contract (wham).
He hadnât known, or even had the faintest idea as to what thecontract was for.
âOf course,â Dirk had thought (wham).
But he had a vague feeling that it might have something to dowith a potato. There was a bit of a
complicated story attached tothat (whim, whim, whim).
Dirk had nodded seriously at this point (wham), and made areassuring tick (wham) on a pad which he kept
on his desk(wham) for the express purpose of making reassuring ticks on(wham, wham, wham). He had prided himself at that moment onhaving managed to convey the impression that he had made atick in a small box marked âPotatoesâ.
Wham, wham, wham, wham
Mr Anstey had said he would explain further about thepotatoes when Dirk arrived to carry out his task. And Dirk had promised (whom), easily (wham), casually(wham), with an airy wave of his hand (wham,
wham, wham), tobe there at six-thirty in the morning (wham), because thecontract (wham) fell due at seven oâclock.
Dirk remembered having made another tick in a notionalâPotato contract falls due at 7.00 a.m.â box. (Wh...)
He couldnât handle all this whamming any more. He couldnâtblame himself for what had happened. Well, he could. Of coursehe could. He did. It was, in fact, his fault (wham). The point wasthat he couldnât continue to blame himself for what hadhappened and think clearly about it, which he was going to haveto do. He would have to dig this horrible thing (wham) up by theroots, and if he was going to be fit to do that he had somehow todivest himself (wham) of this whamming.
A huge wave of anger surged over him as he contemplatedhis predicament and the tangled distress of his life. He hated thisneat patio. He hated all this sundial stuff, and all these neatlypainted windows, all these hideously trim roofs. He wanted toblame it all on the paintwork rather than on himself, on therevoltingly tidy patio paving-stones, on the sheer disgustingabomination of the neatly repointed brickwork.
âExcuse me...â
âWhat?â He whirled round, caught unawares by this intrusioninto his private raging of a quiet polite voice. âAre you connected with...?â The woman indicated all theunpleasantness and the lower-ground-floorness
and the horriblesort of policeness of things next door to her with a little floatingmovement of her wrist. Her wrist wore a red bracelet whichmatched the frames of her glasses. She was looking over thegarden wall from the house on the right, with an air of stightlyanxious distaste.
Dirk glared at her speechlessly. She looked about forty-somethingish and neat, with an instant and unmistakable qualityof advertising about her.
She gave a troubled sigh.
âI know itâs probably all very terrible and everything,â shesaid, âbut do you think it will take long? We only called in thepolice because the noise of that ghastly record was driving us upthe wall. Itâs all a bit...â
She gave him a look of silent appeal, and Dirk decided that itcould all be her fault. She could, as far as he was concerned,take the blame for everything while he sorted it out. Shedeserved it; if only for wearing a bracelet like that.
Without a word, he turned his back on her, and took his furyback inside the house where it began rapidly to freeze intosomething hard and efficient.
âGilks!â he said. âYour smart-alec suicide theory. I like it. Itworks for me. And I think I see how the

clever bastard pulled itoff. Bring me pen. Bring me paper.â
He sat down with a flourish at the cherrywood farmhousetable which occupied the centre of the rear
portion of the roomand deftly sketched out a scheme of events which involved anumber of household or kitchen implements, a swinging,weighted light fitting, some very precise timing, and hinged onthe vital fact that the record turntable was Japanese.
âThat should keep your forensic chaps happy,â said Dirkbriskly to Gilks. The forensic chaps glanced at it, took in itssalient points and liked them. They were simple, implausible,and of exactly that nature which a coroner who liked the samesort of holidays in Marbella which they did would be sure torelish.
âUnless,â said Dirk casually, âyou are interested in the notionthat the deceased had entered into some kind of diabolicalcontract with a supernatural agency for which payment was nowbeing exacted?â
The forensic chaps glanced at each other and shook theirheads. There was a strong sense from them that the morning waswearing on and that this kind of talk was only introducingunnecessary complications into a case which otherwise could bewell behind them before lunch.
Dirk made a satisfied shrug, peeled off his share of the evi-dence and, with a final nod to the constabulary, made his wayback upstairs.
As he reached the hallway, it suddenly became apparent tohim that the gentle sounds of day-time television which he hadheard from out in the garden had previously been masked frominside by the insistent sound of the record stuck in its groove.
He was surprised now to realise that they were in fact comingfrom somewhere upstairs in this house. With a quick look roundto see that he was not observed he stood on the bottom step ofthe staircase leading to the upstairs floors of the house andglanced up them in surprise.

Dirk Gently 2 - The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul

Chapter 6
The stairs were carpeted with a tastefully austere matting type ofsubstance. Dirk quietly made his way up them, past some taste-fully dried large things in a pot that stood on the first landing,and looked into the rooms on the first floor. They, too, weretasteful and dried.
The larger of the two bedrooms was the only one that showedany signs of current use. It had clearly been designed to allowthe morning light to play on delicately arranged flowers andduvets stuffed with something like hay, but there was a feelingthat socks and used shaving heads were instead beginning togather the room into their grip. There was a distinct absence ofanything female in the room - the same sort of absence that amissing picture leaves behind it on a wall. There was an air oftension and of sadness and of things needing to be cleaned outfrom under the bed.
The bathroom, which opened out from it, had a gold dischung on the wall in front of the lavatory, for sales of fivehundred thousand copies of a record called Hot Potato by a bandcalled Pugilism and the Third Autistic Cuckoo. Dirk had a vaguerecollection of having read part of an interview with the leaderof the band (there were only two of them, and one of them wasthe leader) in a Sunday paper. He had been asked about theirname, and he had said that there was an interesting story aboutit, though it turned out not to be. âIt can mean whatever peoplewant-it to mean,â he had added with a shrug from the sofa of hismanagerâs office somewhere off Oxford Street.
Dirk remembered visualising the journalist nodding politelyand writing this down. A vile knot had formed in Dirkâs stomachwhich he had eventually softened with gin.
âHot Potato... â thought Dirk. It suddenly occurred to himlooking at the gold disc hanging in its red frame, that the recordon which the late Mr Ansteyâs head had been perched wasobviously this one. Hot Potato. Donât pick it up.
What could that mean?
Whatever people wanted it to mean, Dirk thought with bedgrace.
The other thing that he remembered now about the interviewwas that Pain (the leader of Pugilism and the
Third AutisticCuckoo was called Pain) claimed to have written the lyrics downmore or less verbatim from a conversation which he orsomebody had overheard in a cafe or a sauna or an aeroplane orsomething like that. Dirk wondered how the originators of theconversation would feel to hear their words being repeated in thecircumstances in which he had just heard them.
He peered more closely at the label in the centre of the goldrecord. At the top of the label it said simply, âARRGH!â, whileunderneath the actual title were the writersâ credits - âPaignton,Mulville, Ansteyâ.
Mulville was presumably the member of Pugilism and theThird Autistic Cuckoo who wasnât the leader. And GeoffAnsteyâs inclusion on the writing credits of a major-sellingsingle was probably what had paid for this house. When Ansteyhad talked about the contract having something to do withPotato he had assumed that Dirk knew what he meant. And he,Dirk, had as easily assumed that Anstey was blithering. lt wasvery easy to assume that someone who was talking about green-eyed monsters with scythes was also blithering when he talkedabout potatoes.
Dirk sighed to himself with deep uneasiness. He took adislike to the neat way the trophy was hanging on the wall andadjusted it a little so that it hung at a more humane and untidyangle. Doing this caused an envelope to fall out from behind theframe and flutter towards the floor. Dirk tried unsuccessfully tocatch it. With an unfit grunt he bent over and picked the thingup.
It was a largish, cream envelope of rich, heavy paper, roughlyslit open at one end, and resealed with Sellotape. In fact itlooked as if it had been opened and resealed with fresh layers oftape many times, an impression which was borne out by thenumber of names to which the envelope had in its time beenaddressed - each successively crossed out and replaced byanother.
The last name on it was that of Geoff Anstey. At least Dirkassumed it was the last name because it was the only one thathad not been crossed out, and crossed out heavily. Dirk peeredat some of the other names, trying to make them out.
Some memory was stirred by a couple of the names which hecould just about discern, but he needed to examine the envelopemuch more closely. He had been meaning to buy himself amagnifying glass ever since he had become a detective, but hadnever got around to it. He also did not possess a penknife, soreluctantly he decided that the most prudent course was to tuckthe envelope away for the moment in one of the deeper recessesof his coat and examine it later in privacy.
He glanced quickly behind the frame of the gold disc to see ifany other goodies might emerge but was

disappointed, and so hequit the bathroom and resumed his exploration of the house.
The other bedroom was neat and soulless. Unused. A pinebed, a duvet and an old battered chest of drawers
that had beenrevived by being plunged into a vat of acid were its mainfeatures. Dirk pulled the door of it closed behind him, andstarted to ascend the small, wobbly, white-painted stairway thatled up to an attic from which the sounds of Bugs Bunny couldbe heard.
At the top of the stairs was a minute landing which opened onone side into a bathroom so small that it would best be used bystanding outside and sticking into it whichever limb you wantedto wash. The door to it was kept ajar by a length of greenhosepipe which trailed from the cold tap of the wash-basin, outof the bathroom, across the landing and into the only other roomhere at the top of the house.
It was an attic room with a severely pitched roof whichoffered only a few spots where a person of anything approachingaverage height could stand up.
Dirk stood hunched in the doorway and surveyed its contents,nervous of what he might find amongst them. There was ageneral grunginess about the place. The curtains were closed andlittle light made it past them into the room, which was otherwiseilluminated only by the flickering glow of an animated rabbit.An unmade bed with dank, screwed-up sheets was pushed undera particularly low angle of the ceiling. Part of the walls and themore nearly vertical surfaces of the ceiling were covered withpictures crudely cut out of magazines.
There didnât seem to be any common theme or purposebehind the cuttings. As well as a couple of pictures of flashyGerman cars and the odd bra advertisement, there were also abadly torn picture of a fruit flan, part of an advertisement for lifeinsurance and other random fragments which suggested they hadbeen selected and arranged with a dull, bovine indifference toany meaning that any of them might have or effect they mightachieve.
The hosepipe curled across the floor and led around the sideof an elderly armchair pulled up in front of the television set.
The rabbit rampaged. The glow of his rampagings played onthe frayed edges of the armchair. Bugs was wrestling with thecontrols of an aeroplane which was plunging to the ground.Suddenly he saw a button marked âAutopilotâ and pressed it. Acupboard opened and a robot pilot clambered out, took one lookat the situation and baled out. The plane hurtled on towards theground but, luckily, ran out of fuel just before reaching it and sothe rabbit was saved.
Dirk could also see the top of a head.
The hair of this head was dark, matted and greasy. Dirkwatched it for a long, uneasy moment before advancing slowlyinto the room to see what, if anything, it was attached to. Hisrelief at discovering, as he rounded the armchair, that the headwas, after all, attached to a living body was a little marred by thesight of the living body to which it was attached.
Slumped in the armchair was a boy.
He was probably about thirteen or fourteen, and although hedidnât look ill in any specific physical way, he was definitely nota well person. His hair sagged on his head, his head sagged onhis shoulders, and he lay in the armchair in a sort of limp,crumpled way, as if heâd been hurled there from a passing train.He was dressed merely in a cheap leather jacket and sleeping-bag.
Dirk stared at him.
Who was he? What was a boy doing here watching televisionin a house where someone had just been decapitated? Did heknow what had happened? Did Gilks know about him? HadGilks even bothered to come up here? It was, after all, severalflights of stairs for a busy policeman with a tricky suicide on hishands.
After Dirk had been standing there for twenty seconds or so,the boyâs eyes climbed up towards him, failed utterly toacknowledge him in any way at all, and then dropped again andlocked back on to the rabbit.
Dirk was unused to making quite such a minuscule impact onanybody. He checked to be sure that he did have his huge leathercoat and his absurd red hat on and that he was properly anddramatically silhouetted by the light of the doorway.
He felt momentarily deflated and said, âEr... â by way ofself introduction, but it didnât get the boyâs attention. He didnâtlike this. The kid was deliberately and maliciously watchingtelevision at him. He frowned. There was a kind of steamytension building in the room it seemed to Dirk, a kind ofdifficult, hissing quality to the whole air of the place which hedid not know how to respond to. It rose in intensity and thensuddenly ended with an abrupt click which made Dirk start.
The boy unwound himself like a slow, fat snake, leanedsideways over the far side of the armchair and made someelaborate unseen preparations which clearly involved, as Dirknow realised, an electric kettle. When he resumed his earliersplayed posture it was with the addition of a plastic pot clutchedin his right hand, from which he forked rubbery strands ofsteaming gunk into his mouth.

The rabbit brought his affairs to a conclusion and gave way toa jeering comedian who wished the viewers to buy a certainbrand of lager on the basis of nothing better than his own hardlydisinterested say-so.
Dirk felt that it was time to make a slightly greater impressionon the proceedings than he had so far managed to do. Hestepped forward dinectly into the boyâs line of sight.
âKid,â Dirk said in a tone that he hoped would sound firm butgentle and not in any way at all patronising or affected orgauche, âI need to know who - â
He was distracted at that moment by the sight which met himfrom the new position in which he was standing. On the otherside of the armchair there was a large, half full catering-size boxof Pot Noodles, a large, half full catering-size box of Mars Bars,a half demolished pyramid of cans of soft drink, and the end ofthe hosepipe. The hosepipe ended in a plastic tap nozzle, andwas obviously used for refilling the kettle.
Dirk had simply been going to ask the boy who he was, butseen from this angle the family resemblance was unmistakable.He was clearly the son of the lately decapitated GeoffreyAnstey. Perhaps this behaviour was just his way of dealing withshock. Or perhaps he really didnât know what had happened. Orperhaps he...
Dirk hardly liked to think.
In fact he was finding it hard to think clearly while thetelevision beside him was, on behalf of a toothpaste manu-facturing company, trying to worry him deeply about some ofthe things which might be going on in his mouth.
âOK,â he said, âI donât like to disturb you at what I knowmust be a difficult and distressing time for you, but I need toknow first of all if you actually realise that this is a difficult anddistressing time for you.â
Nothing.
All right, thought Dirk, time for a little judicious toughness.He leant back against the wall, stuck his hands in his pockets inan OK-if-thatâs-the-way-you-want-to-play-it manner, staredmoodily at the floor for a few seconds, then swung his head upand let the boy have a hard look right between the eyes.
âI have to tell you, kid,â he said tersely, âyour fatherâs dead.â
This might have worked if it hadnât been for a very popularand long-running commercial which started at that moment. Itseemed to Dirk to be a particularly astounding example of thegenre.
The opening sequence showed the angel Lucifer being hurledfrom heaven into the pit of hell where he then lay on a buminglake until a passing demon amved and gave him a can of a fizzysoft drink called sHades. Lucifer took it and tried it. He greedilyguzzled the whole contents of the can and then tumed to camera,slipped on some Porsche design sunglasses, said, âNow weârereally cookinâ!â and lay back basking in the glow of the burningcoals being heaped around him.
At that point an impossibly deep and growly American voice,which sounded as if it had itself crawled from the pit of hel1, orat least from a Soho basement drinking club to which it waskeen to return as soon as possible to marinade itself into shapefor the next voice-over, said, âsHades. The Drink from Hell... âand the can revolved a little to obscure the initial âsâ, and thusspell âHadesâ.
The theology of this seemed a little confused, reflected Dirk,but what was one tiny extra droplet of misinformation in such araging torrent?
Lucifer then mugged at the camera again and said, âI couldreally fall for this stuff... â and just in case the viewer had beenrendered completely insensate by all these goings-on, theopening shot of Lucifer being hurled from heaven was brieflyreplayed in order to emphasise the word âfallâ.
The boyâs attention was entirely captivated by this.
Dirk squatted down in between the boy and the screen.
âListen to me,â he began.
The boy craned his neck round to look past Dirk at the screen.He had to redistribute his limbs in the chair
in order to be able todo this and continue to fork Pot Noodle into himself.
âListen,â insisted Dirk again.
Dirk felt he was beginning to be in serious danger of losingthe upper hand in the situation. It wasnât
merely that the boyâsattention was on the television, it was that nothing else seemedto have any meaning or independent existence for him at all.Dirk was merely a featureless object in the way of the television.The boy seemed to bear him no malice, he merely wished to seepast him.
âLook, can we turn this off for a moment?â Dirk said, and hetried not to make it sound testy.
The boy did not respond. Maybe there was a slight stiffeningof the shoulders, maybe it was a shrug. Dirk turned around andwas at a loss to find which button to push to turn the televisionoff. The whoIe control pane seemed to be dedicated to thesingle purpose of keeping itself turned on - there was no singlebutton marked âonâ or âoffâ. Eventually Dirk simplydisconnected the set from the power socket on the wall andturned back to the boy, who broke his nose.

Dirk felt his septum crunching from the terrific impact of theboyâs forehead as they both toppled heavily backwards againstthe set, but the noise of the bone breaking, and the noise of hisown cry of pain as it broke was completely obliterated by thehowling screams of rage that erupted from the boyâs throat. Dirkflailed helplessly to try and protect himself from the fury of theonslaught, but the boy was on top with his elbow in Dirkâs eye,his knees pounding first on Dirkâs ribcage, then his jaw and thenon Dirkâs already traumatised nose, as he scrambled over him toreconnect the power to the television. He then settled backcomfortably into the armchair and watched with a moody andunsettled eye as the picture reassembled itself.
âYou could at least have waited for the news,â he said in adull voice.
Dirk gaped at him. He sat huddled on the floor, coddling hisbleeding nose in his hands, and gaped at the monstrouslydisinterested creature.
âWhhfff. . . fffmmm. . . nnggh ! â he protested, and then gave upfor the time being, while he probed his nose for the damage.
There was definitely a wobbly bit that clicked nastily betweenhis fingers, and the whole thing seemed suddenly to be ahorribly unfamiliar shape. He fished a handkerchief out of hispocket and held it up to his face. Blood spread easily through it.He staggered to his feet, brushed aside non-existent offers ofhelp, stomped out of the room and into the tiny bathroom. There,he yanked the hosepipe angrily off the tap, found a towel,soaked it in cold water and held it to his face for a minute or twountil the flow of blood gradually slowed to a trickle andstopped. He stared at himself in the mirror. His nose was quitedefinitely leaning at a slightly rakish angle. He tried bravely toshift it, but not bravely enough. It hurt abominably, so hecontented himself with dabbing at it a little more with the wettowel and swearing quietly.
Then he stood there for a second or two longer, leaningagainst the basin, breathing heavily, and practising saying âAllright!â fiercely into the mirror. It came out as âAww-bwigh!âand lacked any real authority. When he felt sufficiently braced,or at least as braced as he was likely to feel in the immediatefuture, he turned and stalked grimly back into the den of thebeast.
The beast was sitting quietly absorbing news of some of theexciting and stimulating game shows that the evening held instore for the determined viewer, and did not look up as Dirkre-entered.
Dirk walked briskly over to the window and drew the curtainssharply back, half hoping that the beast might shrivel upshrieking if exposed to daylight, but other than wrinkling up itsnose, it did not react. A dark shadow flapped briefly across thewindow, but the angle was such that Dirk could not see whatcaused it.
He turned and faced the boy-beast. The midday news bulletinwas starting on television, and the boy seemed somehow a littlemore open, a little more receptive to the world outside theflickering coloured rectangle. He glanced up at Dirk with a sour,tired look.
âWhaddayawananyway?â he said.
âI ted you whad I wad,â said Dirk, fiercely but hopelessly, âIwad...hag od a bobed...I gnow thad faith!â Dirkâs attention had switched suddenly to the televisionscreen, where a rather more up-to-date photograph
of themissing airline check-in girl was being shown.
âWhadayadoingere?â said the boy.
âJjchhhhh!â said Dirk, and perched himself down on the armof the chair, peering intently at the face on
the screen. It hadbeen taken about a year ago, before the girl had learnt aboutcorporate lipgloss. She had frizzy hair and a frumpy, put-uponlook.
âWhoareyou? Wassgoinon?â insisted the boy.
âLoog, chuddub,â snapped Dirk, âIâb tryid to wodge dthith!â
The newscaster said that the police professed themselves tobe mystified by the fact that there was no trace
of Janice Smithat the scene of the incident. They explained that there was alimit to the number of times they could search the samebuildings, and appealed for anyone who might have a clue as toher whereabouts to come forward.
âThadth by segradry! Thadth Mith Pearth!â exclaimed Dirkin astonishment.
The boy was not interested in Dirkâs ex-secnetary, and gaveup trying to atttact Dirkâs attention. He wriggled out of thesleeping-bag and sloped off to the bathroom.
Dirk sat staring at the television, bewildered that he hadnâtrealised before who the missing girl was. Still, there was noreason why he should have done, he realiced. Marriage hadchanged her name, and this was the first time they had shown aphotograph that actually identified her. So far he had taken noreal interest in the strange incident at the airport, but now itdemanded his attention.
The explosion was now officially designated an âAct ofGodâ.
But, thought Dirk, what god? And why?
What god would be hanging around Terminal Two offieathrow Aitport trying to catch the 15.37 flight to

Oslo?
After the miserable lassitude of the last few weeks, hesuddenly had a great deal that required his
immediate attention.He frowned in deep thought for a few moments, and hardlynoticed when the beast-boy snuck back in and snuggled backinto his sleeping-bag just in time for the advertisements to start.The first one showed how a perfectly ordinary stock cube couldform the natural focus of a normal, happy family life.
Dirk leapt to his feet, but even as he was about to startquestioning the boy again his heart sank as he looked at him.The beast was far away, sunk back in his dark, flickering lair,and Dirk did not feel inclined to disturb him again at themoment.
He contented himself with barking at the unresponding childthat he would be back, and bustled heavily down the stairs, hisbig leather coat flapping madly behind him.
In the hallway he encountered the loathed Gilks once more.
âWhat happened to you?â said the policeman sharply,catching sight of Dirkâs bruised and bulging nose. âOndly whad you dold me,â said Dirk, innocently. âI beadbythelf ub.â
Gilks demanded to know what he had been doing, and Dirkgenerously explained that there was a witness
upstairs withsome interesting information to impart. He suggested that Gilksgo and have a word with him, but that it would be best if heturned off the television first.
Gilks nodded curtly. He started to go up the stairs, but Dirkstopped him.
âDoedth eddydthig dthrike you adth dthraydge aboud dthidthhoudth?â he said.
âWhat did you say?â said Gilks in irritation.
âSubbthig dthraydge,â said Dirk.
âSomething what?â
âDthraydge!â insisted Dirk.
âStrange?â
âDthadth right, dthraydge.â
Gilks shrugged. âLike what?â he said.
âId dtheemdth to be cobbleedly dthouledth.â
âCompletely what?â
âDthouledth!â he tried again. âThoul-leth! I dthigg dthadthdverry idderedthigg!â
With that he doffed his hat politely, and swept on out of thehouse and up the street, where an eagle
swooped out of the skyat him and came within a whisker of causing him to fall under a73 bus on its way south.For the next twenty minutes, hideous yells and screamsemanated from the top floor of the house in Lupton Road, andcaused much tension among the neighbours. The ambulancetook away the upper and lower remains of Mr Anstey and also apoliceman with a bleeding face. For a short while after this,there was quietness.
Then another police car drew up outside the house. A lot oâBobâs hereâ type of remarks floated from the house, as anextremely large and burly policeman heaved himself out of thecar and bustled up the steps. A few minutes and a great deal ofscreaming and yelling later he re-emerged also clutching hisface, and drove off in deep dudgeon, squealing his tyres in aviolent and unnecessary manner.
Twenty minutes later a van arrived from which emergedanother policeman carrying a tiny pocket television set. Heentered the house, and re-emerged a short while later leading adocile thirteen-year-old boy, who was content with his new toy.
Once all policemen had departed, save for the single squadcar which remained parked outside to keep watch on the house,a large, hairy, green-eyed figure emerged from its hiding placebehind one of the molecules in the large basement room.
It propped its scythe against one of the hi-fi speakers, dippeda long, gnarled finger in the almost congealed pool of blood thathad collected on the deck of the turntable, smeared the fingeracross the bottom of a sheet of thick, yellowing paper, and thendisappeared off into a dark and hidden otherworld whistling astrange and vicious tune and returning only briefly to collect itsscythe.

Dirk Gently 2 - The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul

Chapter 7
A little earlier in the morning, at a comfortable distance from allthese events, set at a comfortable distance from a well-proponioned window through which cool mid-morning lightwas streaming, lay an elderly one-eyed man in a white bed. Anewspaper sat like a half-collapsed tent on the floor, where ithad been hurled two minutes before, at shortly aher ten oâclockby the clock on the bedside table.
The room was not large, but was furnished in excessivelybland good taste, as if it were a room in an expensive privatehospital or clinic, which is exactly what it was - the WoodsheadHospital, set in its own small but well-kempt grounds on theoutskirts of a small but well-kempt village in the Cotswolds.
The man was awake but not glad to be.
His skin was very delicately old, like finely stretched,translucent parchment, delicately freckled. His exquisitely frailhands lay slightly curled on the pure white linen sheets andquivered very faintly.
His name was variously given as Mr Odwin, or Wodin, orOdin. He was - is - a god, and furthermore he was that leastgood of all gods to be alongside, a cross god. His one eyeglinted.
He was cross because of what he had been reading in thenewspapers, which was that another god had been cutting looseand making a nuisance of himself. It didnât say that in thepapers, of course. It didnât say, âGod cuts loose, makes nuisanceof himself in airport,â it merely described the resultingdevastation and was at a loss to draw any meaningfulconclusions from it.
The story had been deeply unsatisfactory in all sorts of ways,on account of its perplexing inconclusiveness, its going-nowhereness and the irritating (from the newspapersâ point ofview) lack of any good solid carriage. There was of course amystery attached to the lack of carnage, but a newspaperpreferred a good whack of carnage to a mere mystery any day ofthe week.
Odin, however, had no such difficulty in knowing what wasgoing on. The accounts had âThorâ written all over them inletters much too big for anyone other than another god to see.He had thrown this morningâs paper aside in irritation, and wasnow trying to concentrate on his relaxation exercises in order toavoid getting too disturbed about all this. These involvedbreathing in in a certain way and breathing out in a certain otherway and were good for his blood pressure and so on. It was notas if he was about to die or anything - ha! - but there was nodoubt that at his time of life - ha! - he preferred to take thingseasy and look after himself.
Best of all he liked to sleep.
Sleeping was a very important activity for him. He liked tosleep for longish periods, great swathes of time. Merely sleepingovernight was not taking the business seriously. He enjoyed agood nightâs sleep and wouldnât miss one for the world, but hedidnât regard it as anything even half approaching enough. Heliked to be asleep by half past eleven in the morning if possible,and if that could come directly after a nice leisurely lie-in thenso much the better. A little light breakfast and a quick trip to thebathroom while fresh linen was applied to his bed is really allthe astivity he liked to undertake, and he took care that it didnâtjangle the sleepiness out of him and thus disturb his afternoon ofnapping. Sometimes he was able to spend an entire week asleep,and this he regarded as a good snooze. He had also slept throughthe whole of 1986 and hadnât missed it.
But he knew to his deep disgruntlement that he would shortlyhave to arise and undertake a sacred and irritating trust. Sacred,because it was godlike, or at least involved gods, and irritatingbecause of the particular god that it involved.
Sneakily, he twitched the curtains at a distance, using nothingbut his divine will. He sighed heavily. He needed to think and,what was more, it was time for his morning visit to thebathroom.
He rang for the orderly.
The orderly arrived promptly in his well-pressed loose greentunic, good-morninged cheerfully, and bustled around locatingbedroom slippers and dressing-gown. He helped Odin out ofbed, which was a little like rolling a stuffed crow out of a box,and escorted him slowly to the bathroom. Odin walked stiffly,like a head hung between two heavy stilts draped in stripedViyella and white towelling. The orderly knew Odin as MrOdwin, and didnât realise that he was a god, which wassomething that Odin tended to keep quiet about, and wished thatThor would too.
Thor was the God of Thunder and, frankly, acted like it. Itwas inappropriate. He seemed unwilling, or unable, or maybejust too stupid to understand or accept...Odin stopped himself.He sensed that he was beginning mentally to rant. He wouldhave to consider calmly what next to do about Thor, and he wason his way to the right place for a good think.
As soon as Odin had completed his stately hobble to thebathroom door, two nurses hurried in and stripped and remadethe bed with immense precision, patting down the fresh linen,pulling it taut, turning it and tucking

it. One of the nurses,clearly the senior, was plump and matronly, the other younger,darker and more generally bird-like. The newspaper waswhisked off the tloor and neatly refolded, the floor was brisklyHoovered, the curtains hooked back, the flowers and theuntouched fruit replaced with fresh flowers and fresh fruit thatwould, like every piece of fruit before them, remain untouched.
When after a little while the old godâs morning ablutions hadbeen completed and the bathroom door reopened, the room hadbeen transformed. The actual differences were tiny, of course,but the effect was of a subtle but magical transformation intosomething cool and fresh. Odin nodded in quiet satisfaction tosee it. He made a little show of inspecting the bed, like amonarch inspecting a line of soldiers.
âIs it well tucked?â he asked in his old and whispery voice.
âIt is very well tucked, Mr Odwin,â said the senior nurse withan obsequious beam.
âIs it neatly turned?â It clearly was. This was merely a ritual.
âTurned very neatly indeed, Mr Odwin,â said the nurse, âIsupervised the turning down of the sheets
myself.â
âIâm glad of that, Sister Bailey, very glad,â said Odin. âYouhave a fine eye for a trimly turned fold. It
alarms me to knowwhat I shall do without you.â
âWell, Iâm not about to go anywhere, Mr Odwin,â said SisterBailey, oozing happy reassurance.
âBut you wonât last for ever, Sister Bailey,â said Odin. It wasa remark that puzzled Sister Bailey on the
times she had heard it,because of its apparent extreme callousness.
âSure, and none of us lasts for over, Mr Odwin,â she saidgently as she and the other nurse between them
managed thedifficult task of lifting Odin back into hed while keeping hisdignity intact.
âYouâre Irish arenât you, Sister Bailey?â he asked, once hewas properly settled.
âI am indeed so, Mr Odwin.â
âKnew an Irishman once. Finn something. Told me a lot ofstuff I didnât need to know. Never told me
about the linen. Stillknow now.â
He nodded curtly at this memory and lowered his head stifflyback on to the firmly plumped up pillows
and ran the back of hisfinely freckled hand over the folded-back linen sheet. Quitesimply he was in love with linen. Clean, lightly starched, whiteIrish linen, pressed, folded, tucked - the words themselves werealmost a litany of desire for him. In centuries nothing hadobsessed him or moved him so much as linen now did. He couldnot for the life of him understand how he could ever have caredfor anything else.
Linen.
And sleep. Sleep and linen. Sleep in linen. Sleep.
Sister Bailey regarded him with a sort of proprietaryfondness. She did not know that he was a god as such,
in factshe thought he was probably an old film producer or Nazi warcriminal. Certainly he had an accent she couldnât quite placeand his careless civility, his natural selfishness and his obsessionwith personal hygiene spoke of a past that was rich with horrors.
If she could have been transported to where she might see hersecretive patient enthroned, warrior father of the wamor Gods ofAsgard, she would not have been surprised. That is not quitetrue, in fact. She would have been startled quite out of her wits.But she would at least have recognised that it was consistentwith the qualities she perceived in him, once she had recoveredfrom the shock of discovering that virtually everything thehuman race had ever chosen to believe in was true. Or that itcontinued to be true long after the human race particularlyneeded it to be true any more.
Odin dismissed his medical attendants with a gesture, havingfirst asked for his personal assistant to be found and sent to himonce more.
This caused Sister Bailey to tighten her lips just a very little.She did not like Mr Odwinâs personal assistant, generalfactotum, manservant, call him what you will. His eyes weremalevolent, he made her jump, and she strongly suspected himof making unspeakabie suggestions to her nurses during their teabreaks.
He had what Sister Bailey supposed was what people meantby an olive complexion, in that it was extraordinarily close tobeing green. Sister Bailey was convinced that it was not right atall.
She was of course the last person to judge somebody by thecolour of their skin - or if not absolutely the last, she had at leastdone it as recently as yesterday afternoon when an Africandiplomat had been brought in to have some gallstones removedand she had conceived an instant resentment of him. She didnâtlike him. She couldnât say exactly what it was she didnât likeabout him, because she was a nurse, not a taxi-driver, and shewouldnât let her personal feelings show for an instant. She wasmuch too professional, much too good at her job, and treatedeveryone with a more or less equal efficient and cheerfulcourtesy, even, she thought - and a profound iciness settled onher at this point - even Mr Rag.
âMr Ragâ was the name of Mr Odwinâs personal assistant.There was nothing she could do about it. It was

not her place tocriticise Mr Odwinâs personal arrangements. But if it had beenher business, which it wasnât, then she would greatly havepreferred it, and not just for herself, but for Mr Odwinâs ownwell-being as well, which was the important thing, if he couldhave employed someone who didnât give her the absoluteheebie- jeebies, that was all.
She thought no more about it, merely went to look for him.She had been relieved to discover when she came on duty thismorning that Mr Rag had left the premises the previous night,but had then, with a keen sense of disappointment, spotted himreturning about an hour or so ago.
She found him exactly where he was not supposed to be. Hewas squatting on one of the seats in the visitorsâ waiting-roomwearing what looked horribly like a soiled and discardeddoctorâs gown that was much too big for him. Not only that, buthe was playing a thinly unmusical tune on a sort of pipe that hehad obviously carved out of a large disposable hypodermicsyringe which he absolutely should not have had.
He glanced up at her with his quick, dancing eyes, grinnedand continued to tootle and squeak, only significantly louder.
Sister Bailey ran through in her mind all the things that it wascompletely pointless to say about either the roat or the syringe,or about him being in the visitorsâ room frightening, orpreparing to frighten, the visitors. She knew she wouldnât beable to stand the air of injured innocence with which he wouldreply, or the preposterous absurdity of his answers. Her onlycourse was simply to let it pass and just get him away from theroom and out of the way as quickly as possible.
âMr Odwin would like to see you,â she said. She tried to jamsome of her normal lilting quality into her voice, but it justwouldnât go. She wished his eyes would stop dancing like that.Apart from finding it highly disturbing from both a medical andaesthetic point of view she also could not help but be piqued bythe impression it conveyed that there were at least thirty-seventhings in the room more interesting than her.
He gazed at her in this disconcerting manner for a fewseconds then, muttering that there was no peace for the wicked,not even the extremely wicked, he pushed past Sister Bailey andskedaddled up the corridor to receive instructions from his lordand master, quickly, before his lord and master fell asleep.

Dirk Gently 2 - The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul

Chapter 8
By the end of the morning Kate had discharged herself fromhospital. There were some initial difficulties involved in thisbecause first the ward sister and then the doctor in charge ofKateâs case were adamant that she was in no fit state to leave.She had only just emerged from a minor coma and she neededcare, she needed -
âPizza - â insisted Kate.
- rest, she needed -
â- my own home, and fresh air. The air in here is horrible. Itsmells like a vacuum cleanerâs armpit.â
- further medication, and should definitely remain underobservation for another day or so until they were
satisfied thatshe had made a full recovery.
At least, they were fairly adamant. During the course of themorning Kate demanded and got a telephone
and started tryingto order pizza to be delivered to her ward. She phoned around allof the least co-operative pizza restaurants she knew in London,harangued them, then made some noisily unsuccessful attemptsto muster a motorbike to roam around the West End and try andpick up for her an American Hot with a list of additional peppersand mushrooms and cheeses which the controller of the courierservice refused even to attempt to remember, and after an houror so of this sort of behaviour the objections to Kate dischargingherself from the hospital gradually fell away like petals from anautumn rose.
And so, a little after lunchtime, she was standing on a bleakWest London street feeling weak and shaky but in charge ofherself. She had with her the empty, tattered remains of thegarment bag which she had refused to relinquish, and also asmall scrap of paper in her purse, which had a single namescribbled on it.
She hailed a taxi and sat in the back with her eyes closedmost of the way back to her home in Primrose Hill. She climbedup the stairs and let herself into her top-tloor flat. There were tenmessages on her answering machine, which she simply erasedwithout listening to.
She threw open the window in her bedroom and for a momentor two leaned out of it at the rather dangerous and awkwardangle which allowed her to see a patch of the park. It was asmall comer patch, with just a couple of plane trees standing init. The backs of some of the intervening houses framed it, orrather, just failed totally to obscure it, and made it very personaland private to Kate in a way which a vast, sweeping vista wouldnot have been.
On one occasion she had gone to this corner of the park andwalked around the invisible perimeter that marked out the limitsof what she could see, and had come very close to feeling thatthis was her own domain. She had even patted the plane trees ina proprietorial sort of way, and had then sat beneath themwatching the sun going down over London - over its badlyspoiled skyline and its non-delivering pizza restaurants - andhad come away with a profound sense of something or other,though she wasnât quite certain what. Still, she had told herself,these days she should feel grateful for a profound sense ofanything at all, however unspecific.
She hauled herself in from the window, left it wide open inspite of the chill of the outside air, padded through into the smallbathroom and ran the bath. It was a bath of the sprawlingEdwardian type which took up a wonderfully disproportionateamount of the space available, and encompassed most of the restof the room with cream-painted pipes. The taps seethed. As soonas the room was sufficiently full of steam to be warm, Kateundressed and then went and opened the large bathroomcupboard.
She felt faintly embarrassed by the sheer profusion of thingsshe had for putting in baths, but she was for some reasonincapable of passing any chemist or herb shop without going into be seduced by some glass- stoppered bottle of something blueor green or orange and oily that was supposed to restore thenatural balance of some vague substance she didnât even knowshe was supposed to have in her pores.
She paused, trying to choose.
Something pink? Something with extra Vitamin B? VitaminB12? B13? Just the number of things with different types ofVitamin B in them was an embarrassment of choice in itself.There were powders as well as oils, tubes of gel, even packets ofsome kind of pungent smelling seed that was meant to be goodfor some obscure part of you in some arcane way.
How about some of the green crystals? One day, she had toldherself in the past, she would not even bother trying to choose,but would simply put a bit of everything in. When she really feltin need of it. She rather thought that today was the day, and witha sudden reviving rush of pleasure she set about puaing a dropor two of everything in the cupboard into the seething bath untilit was confused with mingling, muddying colours and vergingon the glutinous to touch.
She turned off the taps, went to her handbag for a moment,then returned and lowered herself into the bath, where she laywith her eyes closed, breathing slowly for fully three minutesbefore at last turning her attention to

the scrap of paper she hadbrought with her from the hospital.
It had one word on it, and it was a word she had dragged outof an oddly reluctant young nurse who had
taken hertemperature that morning.
Kate had questioned her about the big man. The big manwhom she had encountered at the airport, whose
body she hadseen in a nearby side ward in the early hours of the night.
âOh no,â the nurse had said, âhe wasnât dead. He was just insome sort of coma.â
Could she see him? Kate had asked. What was his name?
She had tried to ask idly, in passing as it were, which was adifficult trick to pull off with a thermometer in
her mouth, andshe wasnât at all certain she had succeeded. The nurse had saidthat she couldnât really say, she wasnât really meant to talk aboutother patients. And anyway, the man wasnât there any more, hehad been taken somewhere else. They had sent an ambulance tocollect him and take him somewhere else.
This had taken Kate considerably by surprise.
Where had they taken him? What was this special place? Butthe nurse had been unwilling to say anything much more, and asecond or two later had been summoned away by the Sister. Theonly word the nurse had said was the one that Kate had thenscribbled down on the piece of paper she was now looking at.
The word was âWoodsheadâ.
Now that she was more relaxed she had a feeling that thename was familiar to her in some way, though she could notremember where she had heard it.
The instant she remembered, she could not stay in the bathany longer, but got out and made straight for the telephone,pausing only briefly to shower all the gunk off her.

Dirk Gently 2 - The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul

Chapter 9
The big man awoke and tried to look up, but could hardly raisehis head. He tried to sit up but couldnât do that either. He felt asif heâd been stuck to the floor with superglue and after a fewseconds he discovered the most astounding reason for this.
He jerked his head up violently, yanking out great tufts ofyellow hair which stayed painfully stuck to the floor, and lookedaround him. He was in what appeared to be a derelictwarehouse, probably an upper floor judging by the wintry sky hecould see creeping past the grimy, shattered windows.
The ceilings were high and hung with cobwebs built byspiders who did not seem to mind that most of what they caughtwas crumbling plaster and dust. They were supported by pillarsmade from upright steel joists on which the dirty old cream paintwas bubbled and flaking, and these in turn stood on a floor ofbattered old oak on to which he had clearly been glued.Extending out for a foot or two in a rough oval all around hisnaked body the floor glistened darkly and dully. Thin,nostril-cleaning fumes rose from it. He could not believe it. Heroared with rage, tried to wriggle and shake himself butsucceeded only in tugging painfully at his skin where it wasstuck fast to the oak planks.
This had to be the old manâs doing.
He threw his head back hard against the floor in a blow thatcracked the boards and made his ears sing. He roared again andtook some furious satisfaction in making as much hopeless,stupid noise as he could. He roared until the steel pillars rangand the cracked remains of the windows shattered into finershards. Then, as he threw his head angrily from one side to theother he caught sight of his sledge-hammer leaning against thewall a few feet from him, heaved it up into the air with a word,and sent it hurtling round the great space, beating and clangingon every pillar until the whole building reverberated like a madgong.
Another word and the hammer flew back at him, missed hishead by a handâs-width and punched straight down through thefloor, shattering the wood and the plaster below.
In the darker space beneath him the hammer spun, and swunground in a slow heavy parabola as bits of plaster fell about it andrattled on the concrete floor below. Then it gathered a violentmomentum and hurtled back up through the ceiling, smackingup a stack of startled splinters as it punched through another oakfloorboard a handâs-width from the soles of the big manâs feet.
It soared up into the air, hung there for a moment as if itsweight had suddenly vanished, then, deftly flicking its shorthandle up above its head, it drove hard back down through thetloor again - then up again, then down again, punching holes ina splintered ring around its master until, with a long heavygroan, the whole oval section of punctured floor gave way andplunged, twisting, through the air. It shattered itself against thefloor below amidst a rain of plaster debris, from which the figureof the big man then emerged, staggering, flapping at the dustyair and coughing. His back, his arms and his legs were stillcovered with great splintered hunks of oak flooring, but at leasthe was able to move. He leant the flat of his hands against thewall and violently coughed some of the dast from his lungs.
As he turned back, his hammer danced out of the air towardshim, then suddenly evaded his grasp and skidded joyfully offacross the floor striking sparks from the concrete with its greathead, flipped up and parked itself against a nearby pillar at ajaunty angle.
In front of him the shape of a large Coca-Cola vendingmachine loomed through the settling cloud of dust. He regardedit with the gravest suspicion and worry. It stood there with a sortof glazed, blank look to it, and had a note from his father stuckon the front panel saying whatever he was doing, stop it. It wassigned âYou-know- whoâ, but this had been crossed out and firstthe word âOdinâ and then in larger letters âYour Fatherâ hadbeen substituted. Odin never ceased to make absolutely clear hisview of his sonâs intellectual accomplishments. The big mantore the note off and stared at it in anger. A postscript addeddarkly âRemember Wales. You donât want to go through all thatagain.â He screwed the note up and hurled it out of the nearestwindow, where the wind whipped it up and away. For a momenthe thought he heard an odd squeaking noise, but it was probablyjust the blustering of the wind as it whistled between the nearbyderelict buildings.
He turned and walked to the window and stared out of it in abelligerent sulk. Glued to the floor. At his age. What the devilwas that supposed to mean? âKeep your head down,â was whathe guessed. âIf you donât keep it down, Iâll have to keep it downfor you.â That was what it meant. âStick to the ground.â
He remembered now the old man saying exactly that to himat the time of all the unpleasantness with the Phantom fighter jet.âWhy canât you just stick to the ground?â he had said. He couldimagine the old man in his soft-headed benign malice thinking itvery funny to make the lesson so literal.
Rage began to rumble menacingly inside him but he pushed itdown hard. Very worrying things had

recently begun happeningwhen he got angry and he had a bad feeling, looking back at theCoca-Cola vending machine, that another of those veryworrying things must have just happened. He stared at it andfretted.
He felt ill.
He had felt ill a lot of late, and he found it impossible todischarge what were left of his godly duties when he felt he wassuffering from a sort of continual low-grade flu. He experiencedheadaches, dizzy spells, guilt and all the sorts of ailments thatwere featured so often in television advertisements. He evensuffered terrifying blackouts whenever the great rage grippedhim.
He always used to have such a wonderful time getting angry.Great gusts of marvellous anger would hurl him through life. Hefelt huge. He felt flooded with power and light and energy. Hehad always been provided with such wonderful things to getangry about - immense acts of provocation or betrayal, peoplehiding the AtIantic ocean in his helmet, dropping continents onhim or getting drunk and pretending to be trees. Stuff you couldreally work up a rage about and hit things. In short he had feltgood about being a Thunder God. Now suddeniy it washeadaches, nervous tension, nameless anxieties and guilt. Thesewere new experiences for a god, and not pleasant ones.
âYou look ridiculous!â
The voice screeched out and affected Thor like fingernailsscratched across a blackboard lodged in the back of his brain. Itwas a mean voice, a spiteful, jeering voice, a cheap white nylonshirt of a voice, a shiny- trousered pencil moustache of a voice, avoice, in short, which Thor did not like. He reacted very badly toit at the best of times, and was particularly provoked to have tohear it while standing naked in the middle of a decrepitwarehouse with large sections of an oak floor still stuck to hisback.
He spun round angrily. He wanted to be able to turn roundcalmly and with crushing dignity, but no such strategy everworked with this creature, and since he, Thor, would only endup feeling humiliated and ridiculous whatever postune headopted, he might as well go with one he felt comfortable with.
âToe Rag!â he roared, yanked his hammer spinning into theair and hurled it with immense, stunning force at the smallcreature who was squatting complacently in the shadows on topof a small heap of rubble, leaning forward a little.
Toe Rag caught the hammer and placed it neatly on top of thepile of Thorâs clothes that lay next to him. He grinned, andallowed a stray shaft of sunlight to glitter on one of his teeth.These things donât happen by accident. Toe Rag had spent sometime while Thor was unconscious working out how long itwould take him to recover, then industriously moving the pile ofrubble to exactly this spot, checking the height and thencalculating the exact angle at which to lean. As a provocateur heregarded himself as a professional.
âDid you do this to me?â roared Thor. âDid you - â
Thor searched for any way of saying âglue me to the floorâthat didnât sound like âglue me to floorâ, but eventually thepause got too long and he had to give up.
â- glue me to the floor?â he demanded at last. He wished hehadnât asked such a stupid question.
âDonât even answer that!â he added angrily and wished hehadnât said that either. He stamped his foot and shook thefoundations of the building a little just to make the point. Hewasnât certain what the point was, but he felt that it had to bemade. Some dust settled gently around him.
Toe Rag watched him with his dancing, glittering eyes.
âI merely carry out the instructions given to me by yourfather,â he said in a grotesque parody of obsequiousness.
âIt seems to me,â said Thor, âthat the instructions my fatherhas been giving since you entered his service have been veryodd. I think you have some kind of evil grip on him. I donâtknow what kind of evil grip it is, but itâs definitely a grip, anditâs definitely...â synonyms failed him â...evil,â he concluded.
Toe Rag reacted like an iguana to whom someone had justcomplained about the wine.
âMe?â he protested. âHow can I possibly have a grip on yourfather? Odin is the greatest of the Gods of Asgard, and I am hisdevoted servant in all things. Odin says, `Do this,â and I do it.Odin says, `Go there,â and I go there. Odin says, `Go and get mybig stupid son out of hospital before he causes any more trouble,and then, I donât know, glue him to the floor or something,â andI do exactly as he asks. I am merely the most humble offunctionaries. However small or menial the task, Odinâs biddingis what I am there to perform.â
Thor was not sufficiently subtle a student of human nature or,for that matter, divine or goblin nature, to be able to argue thatthis was in fact a very powerful grip to hold over anybody,particularly a fallible and pampered old god. He just knew that itwas all wrong.
âWell then,â he shouted, âtake this message back to myfather, Odin. Tell him that I, Thor, the God of Thunder, demandto meet him. And not in his damned hospital either! Iâm notgoing to hang about reading magazines and looking at fruitwhile he has his bed changed! Tell him that Thor, the God ofThunder, will meet

Odin, the Father of the Gods of Asgard, to-night, at the Challenging Hour in the Halls of Asgard!â
âAgain?â said Toe Rag, with a sly glance sideways at theCoca-Cola vending machine.
âEr, yes,â said Thor. âYes!â he repeated in a rage. âAgain!â
Toe Rag made a tiny sigh, such as one who felt resigned tocarrying out the bidding of a temperamental
simpleton mightmake, and said, âWell, Iâll tell him. I donât suppose he will bebest pleased.â
âIt is no matter of yours whether he is pleased or not!âshouted Thor, disturbing the foundations of the building oncemore. âThis is between my father and myself! You may thinkyourself very clever, Toe Rag, and
you may think that I amnot - â
Toe Rag arched an eyebrow. He had prepared for thismoment. He stayed silent and merely let the stray
beatn ofsunlight glint on his dancing eyes. It was a silence of the mostprofound eloquence.
âI may not know what youâto up to, Toe Rag, I may not knowa lot of things, but I do know one thing. I
know that I am Thor,the God of Thunder, and that I will not be made a fool of by agoblin!â
âWell,â said Toe Rag with a light grin, âwhen you know twothings I expect youâll be twice as clever.
Remember to put yourclothes on before you go out.â He gestured casually at the pilebeside him and departed.

Dirk Gently 2 - The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul

Chapter 10
The trouble with the sort of shop that sells things likemagnifying glasses and penknives is that they tend also to sellall kinds of other fascinating things, like the quite extraordinarydevice with which Dirk eventually emerged after having beenhopelessly unable to decide between the knife with the built-inPhilips screwdriver, toothpick and ball-point pen and the onewith the 13-tooth gristle saw and the tig-welded rivets.
The magnifying glasses had held him in thrall for a shortwhile, particularly the 25-diopter, high-index, vacuum-deposited, gold-coated glass model with the integral handle andmount and the notchless seal glazing, but then Dirk hadhappened to catch sight of a small electronic I Ching calculatorand he was lost.
He had never before even guessed at the existence of such athing. And to be able to move from total ignorance of somethingto total desire for it, and then actually to own the thing all withinthe space of about forty seconds was, for Dirk, something of anepiphany.
The electronic I Ching calculator was badly made. It hadprobably been manufactured in whichever of the South-EastAsian countries was busy tooling up to do to South Korea whatSouth Korea was busy doing to Japan. GIue technology hadobviously not progressed in that country to the point wherethings could be successfully held together with it. Already theback had half fallen off and needed to be stuck back on withSellotape.
It was much like an ordinary pocket calculator, except thatthe LCD screen was a little larger than usual, in order toaccommodate the abridged judgements of King Wen on each ofthe sixty-four hexagrams, and also the commentaries of his son,the Duke of Chou, on each of the lines of each hexagram. Thesewere unusual texts to see marching across the display of apocket calculator, particularly as they had been translated fromthe Chinese via the Japanese and seemed to have enjoyed manyadventures on the way.
The device also functioned as an ordinary calculator, but onlyto a limited degree. It could handle any calculation whichreturned an answer of anything up to â4â²â².
â1+1â²â² it could manage (â2â²â²), and â1+2â²â² (â3â²â²) and â2+2â²â²(â4â²â²) or âtan 74â²â² (â3.4874145â²â²), but anything above â4â²â² itrepresented merely as âA Suffusion of Yellowâ. Dirk was notcertain if this was a programming error or an insight beyond hisability to fathom, but he was crazy about it anyway, enough tohand over ?20 of ready cash for the thing.
âThank you, sir,â said the proprietor. âItâs a nice piece that. Ithink youâll be happy with it.â âI ab,â said Dirk.
âGlad to hear it, sir,â replied the proprietor. âDo you knowyouâve broken your nose?â Dirk looked up from fawning on his new possession.
âYedth,â he said testily, âobf courth I dknow.â
The man nodded, satisfied.
âJust that a lot of my customers wouldnât always know abouta thing like that,â he explained.
Dirk thanked him tersely and humed out with his purchase.A few minutes later he took up residence at the
small comertable of an Islington caf, ordered a small but incredibly strongcup of coffee; and attempted to take stock of his day. Amomentâs reflection told him that he was almost certainly goingto need a small but incredibly strong beer as well, and heattempted to add this to his order.
âA wha?â said the waiter. His hair was very black and filledwith brilliantine. He was tall, incredibly fit and too cool to listento customers or say consonants.
Dirk repeated his order, but what with having the cafâsmusic system, a broken nose, and the waiterâs insuperable coolto contend with, he eventually found it simpler to write out theorder on a napkin with a stub of pencil. The waiter peered at it inan offended manner, and left.
Dirk exchanged a friendly nod with the girl sitting halfreading a book at the next table, who had watched this exchangewith sympathy. Then he set about laying out his morningâsacquisitions on the table in front of him - the newspaper, theelectronic I Ching calculator and the envelope which he hadretrieved from behind the gold disc on Geoffrey Ansteyâsbathroom wall. He then spent a minute or two dabbing at hisnose with a handkerchief, and prodding it tenderly to see howmuch it hurt, which turned out to be quite a lot. He sighed andstuffed the handkerchief back in his pocket.
A few seconds later the waiter returned bearing a herbomelette and a single breadstick. Dirk explained that this wasnâtwhat he had ordered. The waiter shrugged and said that it wasnâthis fault.
Dirk had no idea what to say to this, and said so. He was stillhaving a great deal of difficulty speaking. The waiter asked Dirkif he knew that he had broken his nose and Dirk said that yedth,dthagg you berry budge, he did. The waiter said that his friendNeil had once broken his nose and Dirk said that he hobed ithurd like hell,

which seemed to draw the conversation to a close.The waiter took the omelette and left, vowing never to return. When the girl sitting at the next table looked away for amoment, Dirk leaned over and took her coffee. He knew that hewas perfectly safe doing this because she would simply not beable to believe that this had
happened. He sat sipping at thelukewarm cup and casting his mind back over the day.
He knew that before consulting the I Ching, even anelectronic one, he should try and compose his
thoughts andallow them to settle calmly.
This was a tough one.
However much he tried to clear his mind and think in a calmand collected way, he was unable to stop
Geoffrey Ansteyâshead revolving incessantly in his mind. It revolveddisapprovingly, as if pointing an accusing finger at Dirk. Thefact that it did not have an accusing finger with which to pointonly served to drive the point it was trying to make home all theharder.
Dirk screwed up his eyes and attempted to concentrateinstead on the problem of the mysteriously vanished MissPearce, but was unable to get much of a grip on it. When she hadused to work for him she would often disappear mysteriously fortwo or three days at a time, but the papers didnât make any kindof fuss about it then. Admittedly, there werenât things explodingaround her at the time, at least, not that he was aware of. Shehad never mentioned anything exploding particularly.
Furthermore, whenever he thought of her face, which he hadlast seen on the television set in Geoffrey Ansteyâs house, histhoughts tended instantly to sink towards the head which wasbusy revolving thirty-three and a third times a minute threefloors beneath it. This was not conducive to the calm andcontemplative mood he was seeking. Nor was the very loudmusic on the cafâs music system.
He sighed, and stai-ed at the electronic I Ching calculator.
If he wanted to get his thoughts into some kind of order thenmaybe chronological order would be as good a one as any. Hedecided to cast his mind back to the beginning of the day, beforeany of these appalling things had happened, or at least, beforetheyâd happened to him.
First there had been the fridge.
It seemed to him that by comparison with everything else, theproblem of what to do about his fridge had now shrunk to fairlymanageable proportions. It still provoked a discemible twinge offear and guilt, but here, he thought, was a problem which hecould face up to with relative calm.
The little book of instructions suggested that he shouldsimply concentrate âsoulfullyâ on the question which wasâbesiegingâ him, write it down, ponder on it, enjoy the silence,and then once he had achieved inner harmony and tranquillity heshould push the red button.
There wasnât a red button, but there was a blue buttonmarked âRedâ, and this Dirk took to be the one.
He concentrated for a while on the question, then lookedthrough his pockets for a piece of paper, but was unable to findone. In the end he wrote his question, âShould I buy a newfridge?â on a corner of his napkin. Then he took the view that ifhe was going to wait until he had achieved inner harmony andtranquillity he could be there all night, so he went ahead andpushed the blue button marked âRedâ anyway. A symbol flashedup in a corner of the screen, a hexagram which looked like this:
**************************************************************************************************** 3 : CHUN
the I Ching calculator then scrolled this text Across its tinyLCD display:
âTHE JUDGEMENT OF KING WEN:
âChun Signifies Difficulties At Outset, As Of Blade Of Grass Pushing Up Against Stone. The Time Is Full Of Irregularities And Obscurities: Superior Man Will Adjust His Measures As In Sorting The Threads Of The Warp And Woof. Firm Correctness Will Bring At Last Success. Early Advances Should Only Be Made With Caution. There Will Be Advantage In Appointing Feudal Princes. âLINE 6 CHANGES:
âTHE COMMENTARY OF THE DUKE OF CHOU:
âThe Horses And The Chariot Obliged To Retreat.
Streams Of Bloody Tears Will Flow.â
Dirk considered this for a few moments, and then decidedthat on balance it appeared to be a vote in favour
of getting thenew fridge, which, by a staggering coincidence, was the courseof action which he himself favoured.
There was a pay phone in one of the dark corners wherewaiters slouched moodily at one another. Dirk

threaded his waythrough them, wondering whom it was they reminded him of,and eventually deciding that it was the small crowd of nakedmen standing around behind the Holy Family in Michelangeloâspicture of the same name, for no more apparent reason than thatMichelangelo rather liked them.
He telephoned an acquaintance of his called Nobby Paxton,or so he claimed, who worked the darker side of the domesticappliance supply business. Dirk came straight to the point.
âDobby, I deed a fridge.â
âDirk, I been saving one against the day youâd ask me.â
Dirk found this highly unlikely.
âOnly I wand a good fridge you thee, Dobby.â
âThis is the best, Dirk. Japanese. Microprocessor controlled.â
âWhat would a microprothethor be doing id a fridge,Dobby?â
âKeeping itself cool, Dirk. Iâll get the lads to bring it roundright away. I need to get it off the premises
pretty sharpish forreasons which I wonât trouble you with.â
âI apprethiade thid, Dobby,â said Dirk. âFroblem id, Iâm notat home at preddent.â
âGaining access to houses in the absence of their owner isonly one of the panoply of skills with which my
lads are blessed.Let me know if you find anything missing afterwards, by theway.â
âIâd be happy to, Dobby. Id fact if your ladth are in a moodfor carting thtuff off Iâd be glad if they would
thtart with my oldfridge. It badly needth throwing away.â
âI shall see that itâs done, Dirk. Thereâs usually a skip or twoon your street these days. Now, do you
expect to be paying forthis or shall I just get you kneecapped straight off, saveeverybody time and aggravation all round?â
It was never one hundred per cent clear to Dirk exactly whenNobby was joking and he was not keen to put it to the test. Heassured him that he would pay him, as soon as next they met.
âSee you very soon then, Dirk,â said Nobby. âBy the way, doyou know you sound exactly as if someoneâs broken yournose?â
There was a pause.
âYou there, Dirk?â said Nobby.
âYed,â said Dirk. âI wad judd liddening to a reggord.â
âHot Potato!â roared the hi-fi in the caf.
âDonât pick it up. pick it up, pick it up.
âQuick, pass it on, pass it on, pass it on.â
âI said, do you know you sound exactly as if someoneâsbroken your nose?â repeated Nobby.
Dirk said that he did know this, thanked Nobby for pointingit out, said goodbye, stood thoughtfully for a
moment, madeanother quick couple of phone calls, and then threaded his wayback through the huddle of posing waiters to find the girl whosecoffee he had appropriated sitting at his table.
âHello,â she said, meaningfully.
Dirk was as gracious as he knew how.
He bowed to her very politely, doffed his hat, since all thisgave him a second or so to recover himself, and
requested herpermission to sit down.
âGo ahead,â she said, âitâs your table.â She gesturedmagnanimously.
She was small, her hair was neat and dark, she was in hermid-twenties, and was looking quizzically at the
half-empty cupof coffee in the middle of the table.
Dirk sat down opposite her and leant forwardconspiratorially. âI expeg,â he said in a low voice, âyou
areenquirigg after your coffee.â
âYou betcha,â said the girl.
âId very bad for you, you dow.â
âIs it?â
âId id. Caffeide. Cholethderog in the milgg.â
âI see, so it was just my health you were thinking of.â
âI was thiggigg of meddy thiggs,â said Dirk airily.
âYou saw me sitting at the next table and you thought`Thereâs a nice-looking girl with her health in ruins.
Let me saveher from herself.ââ âIn a nudthell.â
âDo you know youâve broken your nose?â
âYeth, of courth I do,â said Dirk crossly. âEverybodykeepth - â âHow long ago did you break it?â the girl asked.

âId wad broked for me,â said Dirk, âaboud tweddy middiddago.â âI thought so,â said the girl. âClose your eyes for a moment.â Dirk looked at her suspiciously.
âWhy?â
âItâs all right,â she said with a smile, âIâm not going to hurtyou. Now close them.â
With a puzzled frown, Dirk closed his eyes just for amoment. In that moment the girl reached over and gripped himfirmly by the nose, giving it a sharp twist. Dirk nearly explodedwith pain and howled so loudly that he almost attracted theattention of a waiter.
âYou widge!â he yelled, staggering wildly back from thetable clutching his face. âYou double-dabbed widge!â
âOh, be quiet and sit down,â she said. âAll right, I lied aboutit not going to hurt you, but at least it should be straight now,which will save you a lot worse later on. You should get straightround to a hospital to have some splints and padding put on. Iâma nurse, I know what Iâm doing. Or at least, I think I do. Letâshave a look at you.â
Panting and spluttering, Dirk sat down once more, his handscupped round his nose. After a few long seconds he began toprod it tenderly again and then let the girl examine it.
She said, âMy nameâs Sally Mills, by the way. I usually try tointroduce myself properly before physical intimacy takes place,but sometimes,â she sighed, âthere just isnât time.â
Dirk ran his fingers up either side of his nose again.
âI thigg id id trader,â Dirk said at last.
âStraighter,â Sally said. âSay `straighterâ properly. Itâll helpyou feel better. â
âStraighter,â said Dirk. âYed. I thee wad you mead.â
âWhat?â
âI see what you mead.â
âGood,â she said with a sigh of relief, âIâm glad that worked.My horoscope this morning said that
virtually everything Idecided today would be wrong.â
âYes, well you donât want to believe all that rubbish,â saidDirk sharply.
âI donât,â said Satly. Â·
âParticularly not The Great Zaganza.â
âOh, you read it too, did you?â
âNo. That is, well, not for the same reason.â
âMy reason was that a patient asked me to read his horoscopeto him this morning just before he died.
What was yours?â
âEr, a very complicated one.â
âI see,â said Sally, sceptically. âWhatâs this?â
âItâs a calculator,â said Dirk. âWell, look, I mustnât keep you.I am indebted to you, my dear lady, for the
tenderness of yourministrations and the loan of your coffee, but lo! the day wearson, and I am sure you have a heavy schedule of grievous bodilyharm to attend to.â
âNot at all. I came off night duty at nine oâclock thismorning, and all I have to do all day is keep awake so that I cansleep normally tonight. I have nothing better to do than to sitarnund talking to strangers in cafs. You, on the other hand,should get yourself to a casualty department as soon as possible.As soon as youâve paid my bill, in fact.â
She leant over to the table she had originally been sitting atand picked up the running-total lying by her plate. She looked atit, shaking her head disapprovingly.
âFive cups of coffee, Iâm afraid. It was a long night on thewards. All sorts of comings and goings in the middle of it. Onepatient in a coma who had to be moved to a private hospital inthe early hours. God knows why it had to be done at that time ofnight. Just creates unnecessary trouble. I wouldnât pay for thesecond croissant if I were you. I ordered it but it never came.â
She pushed the bill across to Dirk who picked it up with areluctant sigh.
âInordinate,â he said, âlarcenously inordinate. And, in thecircumstances, adding a 15 per cent service charge is tantamountto jeering at you. I bet they wonât even bring me a knife.â
He turned and tried, without any real hope of success, tosummon any of the gaggle of waiters lounging among the sugarbowls at the back.
Sally Mills took her bill and Dirkâs and attempted to addthem up on Dirkâs calculator.
âThe total seems to come to `A Suffusion of YelIowâ,â shesaid.
âThank you, Iâll take that,â said Dirk turning bask crosslyand relieving her of the electronic I Ching set

which he put intohis pocket. He resumed his hapless waving at the tableau ofwaiters.
âWhat do you want a knife for, anyway?â asked Sally.
âTo open this,â said Dirk, waggling the large, heavilySellotaped envelope at her.
âIâll get you one,â she said. A young man sitting on his ownat another nearby table was looking away at
that moment, soSally quickly leaned across and nabbed his knife.
âI am indebted to you,â said Dirk and put out his hand to takethe knife from her.
She held it away from him.
âWhatâs in the envelope?â she said.
âYou are an extremely inquisitive and presumptuous younglady,â exclaimed Dirk.
âAnd you,â said Sally Mills, âare very strange.â
âOnly,â said Dirk, âas strange as I need to be.â
âHumph,â said Sally. âWhatâs in the envelope?â She stillwouldnât give him the knife.
âThe envelope is not yours,â proclaimed Dirk, âand itscontents are not your concern.â
âIt looks very interesting though. Whatâs in it?â
âWell, I wonât know till Iâve opened it!â
She looked at him suspiciously, then snatched the envelopefrom him.
âI insist that you - â expostulated Dirk, incompletely.
âWhatâs your name?â demanded Sally.
âMy name is Gently. Mr Dirk Gently.â
âAnd not Geoffrey Anstey, or any of these other names thathave been crossed out?â She frowned, briefly,
looking at them.
âNo,â said Dirk. âCertainly not.â
âSo you mean the envelope is not yours either?â
âI - that is - â
âAha! So you are also being extremely... what was it?â
âInquisitive and presumptuous. I do not deny it. But I am aprivate detective. I am paid to be inquisitive
and presumptuous.Not as often or copiously as I would wish, but I am neverthelessinquisitive and presumptuous on a professional basis.â
âHow sad. I think itâs much more fun being inquisitive andpresumptuous as a hobby. So you are a professional while I ammerely an amateur of Olympic standard. You donât look like aprivate detective.â
âNo private detective looks like a private detective. Thatâsone of the first rules of private detection.â
âBut if no private detective looks like a private detective,how does a private detective know what it is heâs supposed notto look like? Seems to me thereâs a problem there.â
âYes, but itâs not one that keeps me awake at nights,â saidDirk in exasperation. âAnyway, I am not as other privatedetectives. My methods are holistic and, in a very proper senseof the word, chaotic. I operate by investigating the fundamentalinterconnectedness of all things.â
Sally Mills merely blinked at him.
âEvery particle in the universe,â continued Dirk, warming tohis subject and beginning to stare a bit, âaffects every otherparticle, however faintly or obliquely. Everything interconnectswith everything. The beating of a butterflyâs wings in China canaffect the course of an Atlantic hurricane. If I could interrogatethis table-leg in a way that made sense to me, or to the table-leg,then it could provide me with the answer to any question aboutthe universe. I could ask anybody I liked, chosen entirely bychance, any random question I cared to think of, and theiranswer, or lack of it, would in some way bear upon the problemto which I am seeking a solution. It is only a question ofknowing how to interpret it. Even you, whom I have metentirely by chance, probably know things that are vital to myinvestigation, if only I knew what to ask you, which I donât, andif only I could be bothered to, which I canât.â
He paused, and said, âPlease will you let me have theenvelope and the knife?â
âYou make it sound as if someoneâs life depends on it.â
Dirk dropped his eyes for a moment.
âI rather think somebodyâs life did depend on it,â he said. Hesaid it in such a way that a cloud seemed to
pass briefly overthem.
Sally Mills relented and passed the envelope and the knifeover to Dirk. A spark seemed to go out of her. The knife was too blunt and the Sellotape too thickly applied.Dirk struggled with it for a few seconds but
was unable to slicethrough it. He sat back in his seat feeling tired and irritable.
He said, âIâll go and ask them if theyâve got anythingsharper,â and stood up, clutching the envelope. âYou should go and get your nose fixed,â said Sally Millsquietly.

`âThank you,â said Dirk and bowed very slightly to her.
He picked up the bills and set out to visit the exhibition ofwaiters mounted at the rear of the cafe. He encountered a certaincoolness when he was disinclined to augment the mandatory 15per cent service charge with any voluntary additional token ofhis personal appreciation, and was told that no, that was the onlytype of knife they had and thatâs all there was to it.
Dirk thanked them and walked back through the caf.
Sitting in his seat talking to Sally Mills was the young manwhose knife she had purloined. He nodded to her, but she wasdeeply engrossed in conversation with her new friend and didnot notice.
â...in a coma,â she was saying, âwho had to be moved to aprivate hospital in the early hours. God knows why it had to bedone at that time of night. Just creates unnecessary trouble.Excuse me rabbiting on, but the patient had his own personalCoca-Cola machine and sledge-hammer with him, and that sortof thing is.all very well in a private hospital, but on a short-staffed NHS ward it just makes me tired, and I talk too muchwhen Iâm tired. If I suddenly fall insensible to the floor, wouldyou let me know?â
Dirk walked on, and then noticed that Sally Mills had left thebook she had been reading on her original table, and somethingabout it caught his attention.
It was a large book, called Run Like the Devil. In fact it wasextremely large and a little dog-eared, looking more like a puffpastry cliff than a book. The bottom half of the cover featuredthe normal woman-in-cocktail- dress-framed-in-the-sights-of-a-gun, while the top half was entirely taken up with the authorâsname, Howard Bell, embossed in silver.
Dirk couldnât immediately work out what it was about thebook that had caught his eye, but he knew that some detail of thecover had struck a chord with him somewhere. He gave acircumspect glance at the girl whose coffee he had purloined,and whose five coffees and two croissants, one undelivered anduneaten, he had subsequently paid for. She wasnât looking, so hepurloined her book as well and slipped it into the pocket of hisleather coat.
He stepped out on to the street, where a passing eagleswooped out of the sky at him, nearly forcing him into the pathof a cyclist, who cursed and swore at him from a moral highground that cyclists alone seem able to inhabit.

Dirk Gently 2 - The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul

Chapter 11
Into the well-kempt grounds that lay just on the owtskins of awell-kempt village on the fringes of the well- kempt Cotswoldsturned a less than well-kempt car.
It was a battered yellow Citron 2CV which had had onecareful owner but also three suicidally reckless ones. It made itsway up the driveway with a reluctant air as if all it asked forfrom life was to be tipped into a restful ditch in one of theadjoining meadows and there allowed to settle in gracefulabandonment, instead of which here it was being asked to dragitself all the way up this long gravelled drive which it would nodoubt soon be called upon to drag itself all the way back downagain, to what possible purpose it was beyond its wit to imagine.
It drew to a halt in front of the elegant stone entrance to themain building, and then began to trundle slowly backwardsagain until its occupant yanked on the handbrake, which evokedfrom the car a sort of strangled âeekâ.
A door flopped open, wobbling perilously on its oneremaining hinge, and there emerged from the car a pair of thesort of legs which soundtrack editors are unable to see withoutneeding to slap a smoky saxophone solo all over, for reasonswhich no one besides soundtrack editors has ever been able tounderstand. In this particular case, however, the saxophonewould have been silenced by the proximity of the kazoo whichthe same soundtrack editor would almost certainly have slappedall over the progress of the vehicle.
The owner of the legs followed them in the usual manner,closed the car door tenderly, and then made her way into thebuilding.
The car remained parked in front of it.
After a few minutes a porter came out and examined it,adopted a disapproving manner and then, for lack of anythingmore positive to do, went back in.
A short time later, Kate was shown into the office of MrRalph Standish, the Chief Consultant Psychologist and one ofthe directors of the Woodshead Hospital, who was justcompleting a telephone conversation.
âYes, it is true,â he was saying, âthat sometimes unusuallyintelligent and sensitive children can appear to be stupid. But,Mrs Benson, stupid children can sometimes appear to be stupidas well. I think thatâs something you might have to consider. Iknow itâs very painful, yes. Good day, Mrs Benson.â
He put the phone away into a desk drawer and spent a coupleof seconds collecting his thoughts before looking up.
âThis is very short notice, Miss, er, Schechter,â he said to herat last.
In fact what he had said was, This is ve short notice, Miss,er-â and then he had paused and peered into another of his deskdrawers before saying âSchechterâ.
It seemed to Kate that it was very odd to keep your visitorsânames in a drawer, but then he clearly disliked having thingscluttering up his fine, but severely designed, black ash deskbecause there was nothing on it at all. It was completely blank,as was every other surface in his office. There was nothing onthe small neat steel and glass coffee table which sat squarelybetween two Barcelona chairs. There was nothing on top of thetwo expensive-looking filing cabinets which stood at the back ofthe room.
There were no bookshelves - if there were any books theywere presumably hidden away behind the white doors of thelarge blank built-in cupboards - and although there was oneplain black picture frame hanging on the wall, this waspresumably a temporary aberration because there was no picturein it.
Kate looked around her with a bemused air.
âDo you have no ornaments in here at all, Mr Standish?â sheasked.
He was, for a moment, somewhat taken aback by her trans-atlantic directness, but then answered her. âIndeed I have ornaments,â he said; and pulled open anotherdrawer. He pulled out from this a small china
model of a kittenplaying with a ball of wool and put it firmly on the desk in frontof him.
âAs a psychologist I am aware of the important role thatornamentation plays in nourishing the human
spirit,â hepronounced.
He put the china kitten back in the drawer and slid it closedwith a smooth click. âNow.â
He clasped his hands together on the desk in front of him, andlooked at her enquiringly. âItâs very good of you to see me at short notice, MrStandish - â
âYes, yes, weâve established that.â
â- but Iâm sure you know what newspaper deadlines arelike.â
âI know at least as much as I would ever care to know aboutnewspapers, Miss, er - â

He opened his drawer again.
âMiss Schechter, but - â
âWell thatâs partly what made me approach you,â lied Katecharmingly. âI know that you have suffered
from some, well,unfortunate publicity here, and thought you might welcome theopportunity to talk about some of the more enlightening aspectsof the work at the Woodshead Hospital.â She smiled verysweetly.
âItâs only because you come to me with the highest recom-mendation from my very good friend and colleague Mr, er - â
âFranklin, Alan Franklin,â prompted Kate, to save thepsychologist from having to open his drawer again. AlanFranklin was a therapist whom Kate had seen for a few sessionsafter the loss of her husband Luke. He had warned her thatStandish, though brilliant, was also peculiar, even by the highstandards set by his profession.
âFranklin,â resumed Standish, âthat I agreed to see you. Letme warn you instantly that if I see any resumption of thisâSomething nasty in the Woodsheadâ mendacity appearing in thepapers as a result of this interview I will, I will - â
â`- do such things-
`What they are yet I know not - but they shall be
` The terror of the Earth â,â said Kate, brightly.
Standish narrowed his eyes.
âLear, Act 2, Scene 4,â he said. âAnd I think youâll find itâs`terrorsâ and not `terrorâ.â
âDo you know, I think youâre right?â replied Kate.
Thank you, Alan, she thought. She smiled at Standish, whorelaxed into pleased superiority. It was odd,
Kate reflected, thatpeople who needed to bully you were the easiest to push around.
âSo you would like to know precisely what, Miss Schechter?â
âAssume,â said Kate, âthat I know nothing.â
Standish smiled, as if to signify that no assumption couldpossibly give him greater pleasure.
âVery well,â he said. âThe Woodshead is a research hospital.We specialise in the care and study of
patients with unusual orpreviously unknown conditions, largely in the psychological orpsychiatric fields. Funds are raised in various ways. One of ourchief methods is quite simply to take in private patients atexorbitantly high fees, which they are happy to pay, or at leasthappy to complain about. There is in fact nothing to complainabout because patients who come to us privately are made fullyaware of why our fees are so high. For the money they arepaying, they are, of course, perfectly entitled to complain - theright to complain is one of the privileges they are paying for. Insome cases we come to a special arrangement under which, inreturn for being made the sole beneficiaries of a patientâs estate,we will guarantee to look after that patient for the rest of his orher life.â
âSo in effect you are in the business of giving scholarships topeople with particularly gifted diseases?â
âExactly. A very good way of expressing it. We are in thebusiness of giving scholarships to people with particularly gifteddiseases. I must make a note of that. Miss Mayhew!â
He had opened a drawer, which clearly contained his officeintercom. In response to his summons one of the cupboardsopened, and tumed out to be a door into a side office - a featurewhich must have appealed to some architect who had conceivedan ideological dislike of doors. From this office there emergedobediently a thin and rather blank-faced woman in her mid-forties.
âMiss Mayhew,â said Mr Standish, âwe are in the business ofgiving scholarships to people with particularly gifted diseases.â
âVery good, Mr Standish,â said Miss Mayhew, and retreatedbackwards into her office, pulling the door closed after her. Katewondered if it was perhaps a cupboard after all.
âAnd we do have some patients with some really quiteoutstanding diseases at the moment,â enthused the psychologist.âPerhaps you would care to come and see one or two of ourcurrent stars?â
âIndeed I would. That would be most interesting, MrStandish, youâre very kind,â said Kate.
âYou have to be kind in this job,â Standish replied, andflicked a smile on and off at her.
Kate was trying to keep some of the impatience she wasfeeling out of her manner. She did not take to Mr
Standish, andwas beginning to feel that there was a kind of Martian quality tohim. Furthermore, the only thing she was actually interested inwas discovering whether or not the hospital had accepted a newadmission in the early hours of the morning, and if so, where hewas and whether she could see him.
She had originally tried the direct approach but had beenrebuffed by a mere telephone receptionist on the grounds thatshe didnât have a name to ask for. Simply asking if they had anytall, well-built, blond men in residence had seemed to createentirely the wrong impression. At least, she insisted to herselfthat it was entirely the wrong impression. A quick phone call toAlan Franklin had set her up for this altogether more

subtleapproach.
âGood!â A look of doubt passed momentarily over MrStandishâs face, and he summoned Miss Mayhew
from out ofher cupboard again.
âMiss Mayhew, that last thing I just said to you - â
âYes, Mr Standish?â
âI assume you realised that I wished you to make a note of itfor me?â
âNo, Mr Standish, but I will be happy to do so.â
âThank you,â said Mr Standish with a slightly tense look.âAnd tidy up in here please. The place looks a - â He wanted to say that the place looked a mess, but wasfrustrated by its air of clinical sterility.
âJust tidy up generally,â he concluded.
âYes, Mr Standish.â
The psychologist nodded tersely, brushed a non-existentspeck of dust off the top of his desk, flicked
another brief smileon and off at Kate and then escorted her out of his office into thecorridor which was immaculately laid with the sort of beigecarpet which gave everyone who walked on it electric shocks.
âHere, you see,â said Standish, indicating part of the wallthey were walking past with an idle wave of his hand, but notmaking it in any way clear what it was he wished her to see orwhat she was supposed to understand from it.
âAnd this,â he said, apparently pointing at a door hinge.
âAh,â he added, as the door swung open towards them. Katewas alarmed to find herself giving a little expectant start everytime a door opened anywhere in this place. This was not the sortof behaviour she expected of a worldly-wise New Yorkerjournalist, even if she didnât actually live in New York and onlywrote travel articles for magazines. It still was not right for herto be looking for large blond men every time a door opened.
There was no large blond man. There was instead a small,sandy-haired girl of about ten years old, being pushed along in awheelchair. She seemed very pale, sick and withdrawn, and wasmurmuring something soundlessly to herself. Whatever it wasshe was murmuring seemed to cause her worry and agitation,and she would flop this way then that in her chair as if trying toescape from the words coming out of her mouth. Kate wasinstantly moved by the sight of her, and on an impulse asked thenurse who was pushing her along to stop.
She squatted down to look kindly into the girlâs face, whichseemed to please the nurse a little, but Mr Standish less so.
Kate did not try to demand the girlâs attention, merely gaveher an open and friendly smile to see if she wanted to respond,but the girl seemed unwilling or unable to. Her mouth workedaway endlessly, appearing almost to lead an existence that wasindependent of the rest of her face.
Now that Kate looked at her more closely it seemed that shelooked not so much sick and withdrawn as weary, harassed andunutterably fed up. She needed a little rest, she needed peace,but her mouth kept motoring on.
For a fleeting instant her eyes caught Kateâs, and the messageKate received was along the lines of âIâm sorry but youâll justhave to excuse me while all this is going onâ. The girl took adeep breath, half-closed her eyes in resignation and continuedher relentless silent murmuring.
Kate leant forward a little in an attempt to catch any actualwords, but she couldnât make anything out. She shot an enquir-ing look up at Standish.
He said, simply, âStock market prices.â
A look of amazement crept over Kateâs face.
Standish added with a wry shrug, âYesterdayâs, Iâm afraid.â
Kate flinched at having her reaction so wildly misinterpreted,and hurriedly looked back at the girl in order
to cover herconfusion.
âYou mean,â she said, rather redundantly, âsheâs just sittinghere reciting yesterdayâs stock market prices?â
The girl rolledher eyes past Kateâs.
âYes,â said Standish. âIt took a lip reader to work out whatwas going on. We all got rather excited, of
course, but thencloser examination revealed that they were only yesterdayâswhich was a bit of a disappointment. Not that significant a casereally. Aberrant behaviour. Interesting to know why she does it,but - â
âHold on a moment,â said Kate, trying to sound veryinterested rather than absolutely horrified, âare you saying thatshe is reciting - what? - the closing prices over and over, or - â
âNo. Thatâs an interesting feature of course. She pretty muchkeeps pace with movements in the market over the course of awhole day. Just twenty-four hours out of step.â
âBut thatâs extraordinary, isnât it?â

âOh yes. Quite a feat.â
âA feat?â
âWell, as a scientist, I have to take the view that since theinformation is freely available, she is acquiring it
throughnormal channels. Thereâs no necessity in this case to inventany supernatural or paranonnal dimension. Occamâs razor.Shouldnât needlessly multiply entities.â
âBut has anyone seen her studying the newspapers, orcopying stuff down over the phone?â
She looked up at the nurse, who shook her head, dumbly.
âNo, never actually caught her at it,â said Standish. âAs Isaid, itâs quite a feat. Iâm sure a stage magician
or memory mancould tell you how it was done.â
âHave you asked one?â
âNo. Donât hold with such people.â
âBut do you really think that she could possibly be doing thisdeliberately?â insisted Kate.
âBelieve me, if you understood as much about people as I do,Miss, er - you would believe anything,â said
Standish, in hismost professionally reassuring tone of voice.
Kate stared into the tired, wretched face of the young girl andsaid nothing.
âYou have to understand,â said Standish, âthat we have to berational about this. If it was tomorrowâs stock
market prices, itwould be a different story. That would be a phenomenon of anentirely different character which would merit and demand themost rigorous study. And Iâm sure weâd have no difficulty infunding the research. There would be absolutely no problemabout that.â
âI see,â said Kate, and meant it.
She stood up, a little stiftly, and brushed down her skirt.
âSo,â she said, and felt ashamed of herself, âwho is yournewest patient? Who has arrived most recently,
then?â Sheshuddered at the crassness of the non sequitur, but remindedherself that she was there as a journalist, so it would not seemodd.
Standish waved the nurse and the wheelchair with its sadcharge on their way. Kate glanced back at the girl once, and thenfollowed Standish through the swing-doors and into the nextsection of corridor, which was identical to the previous one.
âHere, you see,â said Standish again, this time apparently inrelation to a window frame.
âAnd this,â he said, pointing at a light.
He had obviously either not heard her question or wasdeliberately ignoring it. Perhaps, thought Kate, he
was simplytreating it with the contempt it deserved.
It suddenly dawned on her what all this Here you see, andAnd thising was about. He was asking her to
admire the qualityof the decor. The windows were sashes, with finely made andbeautifully painted beads; the light fittings were of a heavy dullmetal, probably nickel-plated - and so on.
âVery fine,â she said accommodatingly, and then noticed thatthis had sounded an odd thing to say in her American accent.
âNice place youâve got here,â she added, thinking that thatwould please him.
It did. He allowed himself a subdued beam of pleasure.
âWe like to think of it as a quality caring environment,â hesaid.
âYou must get a lot of people wanting to come here,â Katecontinued, plugging away at her theme. âHow
often do youadmit new patients? When was the last -?â
With her left hand she carefully restrained her right handwhich wanted to strangle her at this moment.
A door they were passing was slightly ajar, and she tried,unobtrusively, to look in.
âVery well, weâll take a look in here,â said Standish imme-diately, pushing the door fully open, on what
transpired to bequite a small room.
âAh yes,â Standish said, recognising the occupant. Heushered Kate in.
The occupant of the room was another non-large, non-blondperson. Kate was beginning to find the whole
visit to besomething of an emotionally wearing experience, and she had afeeling that things were not about to ease up in that respect.
The man sitting in the bedside chair while his bed was beingmade up by a hospital orderly was one of the most deeply anddisturbingly tousled people that Kate had ever seen. In fact itwas only his hair that was tousled, but it was tousled to such anextreme degree that it seemed to draw all of his long face up intoits distressed chaos.
He seemed quite content to sit where he was, but there wassomething tremendously vacant about his contentedness - heseemed literally to be content about nothing. There was acompletely empty space hanging in the air about eighteen inchesin front of his face, and his contentedness, if it sprang fromanything, sprang from

staring at that.
There was also a sense that he was waiting for something.Whether it was something that was about to
happen at anymoment, or something that was going to happen later in theweek, or even something that was going to happen some littlewhile after hell iced over and British Telecom got the phonesfixed was by no means apparent because it seemed to be all thesame to him. If it happened he was ready for it and if it didnât-he was content.
Kate found such contentedness almost unbearably distressing.
âWhatâs the matter with him?â she said quietly, and theninstantly realised that she was talking as if he wasnât there whenhe could probably speak perfectly well for himself. Indeed, atthat moment, he suddenly did speak.
âOh, er, hi,â he said. âOK, yeah, thank you.â
âEr, hello,â she said, in response, though it didnât seem quiteto fit. Or rather, what he had said didnât seem quite to fit.Standish made a gesture to her to discourage her from speaking.
âEr, yeah, a bagel would be fine,â said the contented man. Hesaid it in a flat kind of tone, as if merely repeating something hehad been given to say.
âYeah, and maybe some juice,â he added. âOK, thanks.â Hethen relaxed into his state of empty watchfulness.
âA very unusual condition,â said Standish, âthat is to say, wecan only believe that it is entirely unique. Iâve certainly neverheard of anything remotely like it. It has also proved virtuallyimpossible to verify beyond question that it is what it appears tobe, so Iâm glad to say that we have been spared theembarrassment of attempting to give the condition a name.â
âWould you like me to help Mr Elwes back to bed?â askedthe orderly of Standish. Standish nodded. He didnât bother towaste words on minions.
The orderly bent down to talk to the patient.
âMr Elwes?â he said quietly.
Mr Elwes seemed to swim up out of a reverie.
âMmmm?â he said, and suddenly looked around. He seemedconfused. âOh! Oh? What?â he said faintly.
âWould you like me to help you back to bed?â
âOh. Oh, thank you, yes. Yes, that would be kind.â
Though clearly dazed and bewildered, Mr Elwes was quiteable to get himself back into bed, and all the
orderly needed tosupply was reassurance and encouragement. Once Mr Elweswas well settled, the orderly nodded politely to Standish andKate and made his exit.
Mr Elwes quickly lapsed back into his trancelike state, lyingpropped up against an escarpment of pillows. His head droppedforward slightly and he stared at one of his knees, poking upbonily from under the covers.
âGet me New York,â he said.
Kate shot a puzzled glance at Standish, hoping for some kindof explanation, but got none.
âOh, OK,â said Mr Elwes, âitâs 541 something. Hold on.â Hespoke another four digits of a number in his
dead, flat voice.
âWhat is happening here?â asked Kate at last.
âIt took us rather a long time to work it out. It was only quiteby the remotest chance that someone
discovered it. Thattelevision was on in the room... â
He pointed to the small portable set off to one side of the bed.
â. . .tuned to one of those chat programme things, whichhappened to be going out live. Most extraordinary
thing. MrElwes was sitting here muttering about how much he hated theBBC - donât know if it was the BBC, perhaps it was one ofthose other channels they have now - and was expressing anopinion about the host of the programme, to the effect that heconsidered him to be a rectum of some kind, and sayingfurthermore that he wished the whole thing was over and that,yes, all right he was coming, and then suddenly what he wassaying and what was on the television began in someextraordinary way almost to synchronise.â
âI donât understand what you mean,â said Kate.
âIâd be surprised if you did,â said Standish. âEverything thatElwes said was then said just a moment later on the television bya gentleman by the name of Mr Dustin Hoffman. It seems thatMr Elwes here knows everything that this Mr Hoffman is goingto say just a second or so before he says it. It is not, I have tosay, something that Mr Hoffman would be very pleased about ifhe knew. Attempts have been made to alert the gentleman to theproblem, but he has proved to be somewhat difficult to reach.â
âJust what the shit is going on here?â asked Mr Elwesplacidly.

âMr Hoffman is, we believe, currently making a film onlocation somewhere on the west coast of America.â
He looked at his watch.
âI think he has probably just woken up in his hotel and ismaking his early morning phone calls,â he added. Kate was gazing with astonishment between Standish and theextraordinary Mr Elwes.
âHow long has the poor man been like this?â
âOh, about five years I think. Started absolutely out of theblue. He was sitting having dinner with his
family one day asusual when suddenly he started complaining about his caravan.And then shortly afterwards about how he was being shot. Hethen spent the entire night talking in his sleep, repeating thesame apparently meaningless phrases over and over again andalso saying that he didnât think much of the way they werewritten. It was a very trying time for his family, as you canimagine, living with such a perfectionist actor and not evenrealising it. It now seems very surprising how long it took themto identify what was occurring. Particularly when he once wokethem all up in the early hours of the morning to thank them andthe producer and the director for his Oscar.â
Kate, who didnât realise that the day was still only softeningher up for what was to come, made the mistake of thinking thatit had just reached a climax of shock.
âThe poor man,â she said in a hushed voice. âWhat a patheticstate to be in. Heâs just living as someone elseâs shadow.â
âI donât think heâs in any pain.â
Mr Elwes appeared to be quietly locked in a bitter argumentwhich seemed to touch on the definitions of the words âpointsâ"grossâ, âprofitsâ and âlimoâ.
âBut the implications of this are extraordinary arenât they?âsaid Kate. âHeâs actually saying these things moments beforeDustin Hoffman?â
âWell, itâs all conjecture of course. Weâve only got a fewclear instances of absolute correlation and we just havenât gotthe opportunity to do more thorough research. One has torecognise that those few instances of direct correlation were notrigorously documented and could more simply be explained ascoincidence. The rest could be merely the product of anelaborate fantasy.â
âBut if you put this case next to that of the girl we justsaw... â
âAh, well we canât do that you see. We have to judge eachcase on its own merits.â
âBut theyâre both in the same world...â
âYes, but there are separate issues. Obviously, if Mr Elweshere could demonstrate significant precognition
of, for instance,the head of the Soviet Union or, better still, the President of theUnited States, then clearly there would be important defenceissues involved and one might be prepared to stretch a point onthe question of what is and what is not coincidence and fantasy,but for a mere screen actor - that is, a screen actor with noapparent designs on political office - I think that, no, we have tostick to the principles of rigorous science.
âSo,â he added, turning to leave, and drawing Kate with him,âI think that in the cases of both Mr Elwes and, er, what-was-her-name, the charming girl in the wheelchair, it may be that weare not able to be of much more help to them, and we may needthe space and facilities for more deserving cases.â
Kate could think of nothing to say to this and followed,seething dumbly.
âAh, now here we have an altogether much more interestingand promising case,â said Standish, forging on ahead throughthe next set of double doors.
Kate was trying to keep her reactions under control, butnevertheless even someone as glassy and Martian as MrStandish could not help but detect that his audience was notabsolutely with him. A little extra brusqueness and impatiencecrept into his demeanour, to join forces with the large quantitiesof brusqueness and impatience which were already there.
They paced down the corridor for a few seconds in silence.Kate was looking for other ways of casually introducing thesubject of recent admissions, but was forced to concede toherself that you cannot attempt to introduce the same subjectthree times in a row without beginning to lose that vital qualityof casualness. She glanced as surreptitiously as she could at eachdoor they passed, but most were firmly closed, and the ones thatwere not revealed nothing of interest.
She glanced out of a window as they walked past it andnoticed a van turning into a roar courtyard. It caught herattention in the brief instant that it was within her view becauseit very clearly wasnât a bakerâs van or a laundry van. Bakerâsvans and laundry vans advertise their business and have wordslike âBakeryâ and âLaundryâ painted on them, whereas this vanwas completely blank. It had absolutely nothing to say to anyonennd it said it loudly and distinctly.
It was a large, heavy, serious-looking van that was almost onthe verge of being an actual lorry, and it was

painted in auniform dark metallic grey. It reminded Kate of the huge gun-metal-grey freight lorries which thunder through Bulgaria andYugoslavia on their way from Albania with nothing but theword âAlbaniaâ stencilled on their sides. She rememberedwondering what it was that the Albanians exported in such ananonymous way, but when on one occasion she had looked it up,she found that their only export was electricity - which, if sheremembered her high school physics correctly, was unlikely tobe moved around in lorries.
The large, serious-looking van turned and started to reversetowards a rear entrance to the hospital. Whatever it was that thevan usually carried, Kate thought, it was about either to pick itup or deliver it. She moved on.
A few moments later Standish arrived at a door, knocked at itgently and looked enquiringly into the room within. He thenbeckoned to Kate to follow him in.
This was a room of an altogether different sort. Immediatelywithin the door was an ante-room with a very large windowthrough which the main room could be seen. The two roomswere clearly sound-proofed from each other, because the ante-room was decked out with monitoring equipment andcomputers, not one of which but didnât hum loudly to itself, andthe main room contained a woman lying in bed, asleep.
âMrs Elspeth May,â said Standish, and clearly felt that hewas introducing the top of the bill. Her room was obviously avery good one - spacious and furnished comfortably and expen-sively. Fresh flowers stood on every surface, and the bedsidetable on which Mrs Mayâs knitting lay was of mahogany.
She herself was a comfortably shaped, silver-haired lady oflate middle age, and she was lying asleep half propped up in bedon a pile of pillows, wearing a pink woolly cardigan. Aher amoment it became clear to Kate that though she was asleep shewas by no means inactive. Her head lay back peacefully with hereyes closed, but her right hand was clutching a pen which wasscribbling away furiously on a large pad of paper which laybeside her. The hand, like the wheelchair girlâs mouth, seemedto lead an independent and feverishly busy existence. Somesmall pinkish electrodes were taped to Mrs Mayâs forehead justbelow her hairline, and Kate assumed that these were providingsome of the readings which danced across the computer screensin the ante-room in which she and Standish stood. Two white-coated men and a woman sat monitoring the equipment, and anurse stood watching through the window. Standish exchanged acouple of brief words with them on the current state of thepatient, which was universally agreed to be excellent.
Kate could not escape the impression that she ought to knowwho Mrs May was, but she didnât and was forced to ask.
âShe is a medium,â said Standish a little crossly, âas Iassumed you would know. A medium of prodigious powers. Sheis currently in a trance and engaged in automatic writing. She istaking dictation. Virtually every piece of dictation she receivesis of inestimable value. You have not heard of her?â
Kate admitted that she had not.
âWell, you are no doubt familiar with the lady who claimedthat Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert were dictating music toher?â
âYes, I did hear about that. There was a lot of stuff in coloursupplements about her a few years ago.â
âHer claims were, well, interesting, if thatâs the sort of thingyouâre interested in. The music was certainly more consistentwith what might be produced by each of those gentlemenquickly and before breakfast, than it was with what you wouldexpect from a musically unskilled middle-aged housewife.â
Kate could not let this pomposity pass.
âThatâs a rather sexist viewpoint,â she said, âGeorge Eliotwas a middle-aged housewife.â
âYes, yes,â said Standish testily, âbut she wasnât takingmusical dictation from the deceased Wolfgang
Amadeus. Thatâsthe point Iâm making. Please try and follow the logic of thisargument and do not introduce irrelevancies. If I felt for amoment that the example of George Eliot could shed any lighton our present problem, you could rely on me to introduce itmyself.
âWhere was I?â
âI donât know.â
âMabel. Doris? Was that her name? Let us call her Mabel.The point is that the easiest way of dealing with
the Dorisproblem was simply to ignore it. Nothing very important hingedon it at alI. A few concerts. Second rate material. But here, herewe have something of an altogether diffenent nature.â
He said this last in hushed tones and turned to study a TVmonitor which stood among the bank of computer screens. Itshowed a close-up of Mrs Mayâs hand scuttling across her padof paper. Her hand largely obscured what she had written, but itappeared to be mathematics of some kind.
âMrs May is, or so she claims, taking dictation from some ofthe greatest physicists. From Einstein and from Heisenberg andPlanck. And it is very hard to dispute her claims, because theinformation being produced

here, by automatic writing, bythis...untutored lady, is in fact physics of a very profound order.
âFrom the late Einstein we are getting more and morerefinements to our picture of how time and space work at amacroscopic level, and from the late Heisenberg and Planck weare increasing our understanding of the fundamental structuresof matter at a quantum level. And there is absolutely no doubtthat this information is
edging us closer and closer towards theelusive goal of a Grand Unified Field Theory of Everything.
âNow this produces a very interesting, not to say somewhatembarrassing situation for scientists because the means by whichthe information is reaching us seems to be completely contraryto the meaning of the
information.â
âItâs like Uncle Henry,â said Kate, suddenly.
Standish looked at her blankly.
âUncle Henry thinks heâs a chicken,â Kate explained.
Standish looked at her blankly again.
âYou must have heard it,â said Kate. â`Weâre terribly worriedabout Uncle Henry. He thinks heâs a
chicken.â `Well, why donâtyou send him to the doctor?â `Well, we would only we need theeggs.ââ.
Standish stared at her as if a small but perfectly formedelderberry tree had suddenly sprung unbidden from
the bridge ofher nose.
âSay that again,â he said in a small, shocked voice.
âWhat, all of it?â
âAll of it.â
Kate stuck her fist on her hip and said it again, doing thevoices with a bit more dash and Southern accents
this time.
ââThatâs brilliant,â Standish breathed when she had done.
âYou must have heard it before,â she said, a little surprisedby this response. âItâs an old joke.â
âNo,â he said, âI have not. We need the eggs. We need the eggs. We need the eggs. `We canât send him to
the doctorbecause we need the eggs.â An astounding insight into thecentral paradoxes of the human condition and of ourindefatigable facility for constructing adaptive rationales toaccount for it. Good God.â
Kate shrugged.
âAnd you say this is a joke?â demanded Standishincredulously.
âYes. Itâs very old, really.â
âAnd are they all like that? I never realised.â
âWell - â
âIâm astounded,â said Standish, âutterly astounded. I thoughtthat jokes were things that fat people said on
television and Inever listened to them. I feel that people have been keepingsomething from me. Nurse!â
The nurse who had been keeping watch on Mts May throughthe window jumped at being barked at
unexpectedly like this.
âEr, yes, Mr Standish?â she said. He clearly made hernervous.
âWhy have you never told me any jokes?â
The nurse stared at him, and quivered at the impossibility ofeven knowing how to think about answering
such a question. âEr, well... â
âMake a note of it will you? In future I will require you andall the other staff in this hospital to tell me all the jokes you haveat your disposal, is that understood?â
âEr, yes, Mr Standish - â
Standish looked at her with doubt and suspicion.
âYou do know some jokes do you, nurse?â he challengedher.
âEr, yes, Mr Standish, I think, yes I do.â
âTell me one.â
âWhat, er, now, Mr Standish?â
âThis instant.â
âEr, well, um - thereâs one which is that a patient wakes upafter having, well, that is, heâs been to, er, to
surgery, and hewakes up and, itâs not very good, but anyway, heâs been tosurgery and he says to the doctor when he wakes up, âDoctor,doctor, whatâs wrong with me, I canât feel my legs.â And thedoctor says, `Yes, Iâm afraid weâve had to amputate both yourarms.â And thatâs it really. Er, thatâs why he couldnât feel hislegs, you see.â
Mr Standish looked at her levelly for a moment or two. âYouâre on report, nurse,â he said.

âYes, Mr Standish.â
He turned to Kate.
âIsnât there one about a chicken crossing a road or some suchthing?â
âEr, yes,â said Kate, doubtfully. She felt she was caught in abit of a situation here.
âAnd how does that go?â
âWell,â said Kate, âit goes `Why did the chicken cross theroad?ââ
âYes? And?â
âAnd the answer is `To get to the other sideâ.â
âI see.â Standish considered things for a moment. âAnd whatdoes this chicken do when it arrives at the
other side of theroad?.â
âHistory does not relate,â replied Kate promptly. âI think thatfalls outside the scope of the joke, which
really only concernsitself with the journey of the chicken across the road and thechickenâs reasons for making it. Itâs a little like a Japanese haikuin that respect.â
Kate suddenly found she was enjoying herself. She manageda surreptitious wink at the nurse, who had no idea what to makeof anything at all.
âI see,â said Standish once again, and frowned. âAnd dothese, er, jokes require the preparatory use of any form ofartificial stimulant?â
âDepends on the joke, depends on who itâs being told to.â
âHmm, well I must say, youâve certainly opened up a richfurrow for me, Miss, er. It seems to me that the whole field ofhumour could benefit from close and immediate scrutiny.Clearly we need to sort out the jokes which have any kind ofgenuine psychological value from those which merelyencourage drug abuse and should be stopped. Good.â
He turned to address the white-coated nesearcher who wasstudying the TV monitor on which Mrs Mayâs scribblings werebeing tracked.
âAnything fresh of value from Mr Einstein?â he asked.
The researrher did not move his eyes from the screen. Hereplied, âIt says `How would you like your eggs? Poached orboiled?ââ
Again, Standish paused.
âInteresting,â he said, âvery interesting. Continue to make atcareful note of everything she writes. Come.â This last he said toKate, and made his way out of the room.
âVery strange people, physicists,â he said as soon as theywere outside again. âIn my experience the ones who arenâtactually dead are in some way very ill. Well, the afternoonpresses on and Iâm sure that you are keen to get away and writeyour article, Miss, er. I certainly have things urgently awaitingmy attention and patients awaiting my care. So, if you have nomore questions - â
âThere is just one thing, Mr Standish.â Kate decided, to hellwith it. âWe need to emphasise that itâs up to the minute.Perhaps if you could spare a couple more minutes we could goand see whoever is your most recent admission.â
âI think that would be a little tricky. Our last admission wasabout a month ago and she died of pneumonia two weeks afteradmission.â
âOh, ah. Well, perhaps that isnât so thrilling. So. No newadmissions in the last couple of days. No admissions of anyoneparticularly large or blond or Nordic, with a fur coat or a sledge-hammer perhaps. I mean, just for instance.â An inspirationstruck her. âA re-admission perhaps?â
Standish regarded her with deepening suspicion.
âMiss, er - â
âSchechter.â
âMiss Schechter, I begin to get the impression that yourinterests in the hospital are not - â
He was interrupted at that moment by the swing-doors justbehind them in the corridor being pushed open.
He looked up tosee who it was, and as he did so his manner changed.
He motioned Kate sharply to stand aside while a large trolleybed was wheeled through the doors by an
orderly. A sister andanother nurse followed in attendance, and gave the impressionthat they were the entourage in a procession rather than merelynurses about their normal business.
The occupant of the trolley was a delicately frail old manwith skin like finely veined parchment.
The rear section of the trolley was inclined upwards at a veryslight angle so that the old man could survey the world as itpassed him, and he surveyed it with a kind of quiet, benevolenthorror. His mouth hung gently open and his head lolled veryslightly, so that every slightest bump in the progress of thetrolley caused it to roll a little to one side or the other. Yet inspite of his fragile listlessness, the air he emanated was that ofvery

quietly, very gently, owning everything.
It was the one eye which conveyed this. Each thing it restedon, whether it was the view through a window,
or the nurse whowas holding back the door so that the trolley could movethrough it without impediment, or whether it was on MrStandish, who suddenly was all obsequious charm andobeisance, all seemed instantly gathered up into the domainruled by that eye.
Kate wondered for a moment how it was that eyes conveyedsuch an immense amount of information about their owners.They were, after all, merely spheres of white gristle. Theyhardly changed as they got older, apart from getting a bit redderand a bit runnier. The iris opened and closed a bit, but that wasall. Where did all this flood of information come from?Particularly in the case of a man with only one of them and onlya sealed up flap of skin in place of the other.
She was interrupted in this line of thought by the fact that atthat instant the eye in question moved on from Standish andsettled on her. The grip it exerted was so startling that shealmost yelped.
With the frailest of faint motions the old man signalled to theorderly who was pushing the trolley to pause. The trolley drewto a halt and when the noise of its rolling wheels was stilledthere was, for a moment, no other noise to be heard other thanthe distant hum of an elevator.
Then the elevator stopped.
Kate returned his look with a little smiling frown as if to say,âSorry, do I know you?â and then wondered to herself if in factshe did. There was some fleeting familiarity about his face, butshe couldnât quite catch it. She was impressed to notice thatthough this was only a trolley bed he was in, the bed linen thathis hands lay on was real linen, freshly laundered and ironed.
Mr Standish coughed slightly and said, âMiss, er, this is oneof our most valued and, er, cherished patients, Mr-â
âAre you quite comfortable, Mr Odwin?â interrupted theSister helpfully. But there was no need. This was one patientwhose name Standish most certainly knew.
Odin quieted her with the slightest of gestures.
âMr Odwin,â said Standish, âthis is Miss, er - â
Kate was about to introduce herself once more when she wassuddenly taken completely by surprise.
âI know exactly who she is,â said Odin in a quiet but distinctvoice, and there was in his eye for a moment
the sense of anaerosol looking meaningfully at a wasp.
She tried to be very formal and English.
âIâm afraid,â she said stiffly, âthat you have the advantage ofme.â
âYes,â said Odin.
He gestured to the orderly, and together they resumed theirleisurely passage down the corridor. Glances
were exchangedbetween Standish and the Sister, and then Kate was startled tonotice that there was someone else standing in the corridor therewith them.
He had not, presumably, appeared there by magic. He hadmerely stood still when the trolley moved on, and his height, orrather his lack of it, was such that he had simply hitherto beenhidden behind it.
Things had been much better when he had been hidden.
There are some people you like immediately, some whomyou think you might learn to like in the fullness of time, andsome that you simply want to push away from you with a sharpstick. It was instantly apparent into which category, for Kate, theperson of Toe Rag fell. He grinned and stared at her, or rather,appeared to stare at some invisible fly darting round her head.
He ran up, and before she could prevent him, grabbed hold ofher right hand in his and shook it wildly up and down.
âI, too, have the advantage of you, Miss Schechter,â he said,and gleefully skipped away up the corridor.

Dirk Gently 2 - The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul

Chapter 12
The large, serious-looking grey van moved smoothly down thedriveway, emerged through the stone gates and dipped sedatelyas it turned off the gravel and on to the asphalt of the publicroad. The road was a windy country lane lined with the wintrysilhouettes of leafless oaks and dead elms. Grey clouds werepiled high as pillows in the sky. The van made its statelyprogress away down the lane and soon was lost among itsfurther twists and turns.
A few minutes later the yellow Citron made its less statelyappearance between the gates. It turned its splayed wheels up onto the camber of the lane and set off at a slow but difficult rate inthe same direction.
Kate was rattled.
The last few minutes had been rather unpleasant. Standishwas clearly an oddly behaved man at the best of times, but aftertheir encounter with the patient named Odwin, he had turnedunequivocally hostile. It was the frightening hosulity of one whowas himself frightened - of what, Kate did not know.
Who was she? he had demanded to know. How had shewheedled a refenence out of Alan Franklin, a respected man inthe profession? What was she after? What - and this seemed tobe the big one - had she done to arouse the disapprobation of MrOdwin?
She held the car grimly to the road as it negotiated the bendswith considerable difficulty and the straight sections with onlyslightly less. The car had landed her in court on one occasionwhen one of its front wheels had sailed off on a little expeditionof its own and nearly caused an accident. The police witness incourt had referred to her beloved Citron as âthe alleged carâand the name had subsequently stuck. She was particularly fondof the alleged car for many reasons. If one of its doors, forinstance, fell off she could put it back on herself, which is morethan you could say for a BMW.
She wondered if she looked as pale and wan as she felt, butthe rear-view mirror was rattling around under the seat so shewas spared the knowledge.
Standish himself had become quite white and shaky at thevery idea of anybody crossing Mr Odwin and had dismissed outof hand Kateâs attempts to deny that she knew anything of himat all. If that were the case, he had demanded of her, why thenhad Mr Odwin made it perfectly clear that he knew her? Wasshe accusing Mr Odwin of being a liar? If she was then sheshould have a care for herself.
Kate did not know. The encounter with Mr Odwin wascompletely inexplicable to her. But she could not deny to herselfthat the man packed some kind of punch. When he looked at youyou stayed looked at. But beneath the disturbing quality of hissteady gaze had lain some even more disturbing undercurrents.They were more disturbing because they were undercurrents ofweakness and fear.
And as for the other creature. . .
Clearly he was the cause of the stories that had arisen recentlyin the more extremely abhorrent sectors of the tabloid pressabout there being âSomething Nasty in the Woodsheadâ. Thestories had, of course, been offensive and callously insensitiveand had largely been ignored by everybody in the country exceptfor those very few millions who were keen on offensive andcallously insensitive things.
The stories had claimed that people in the nrea had beenâterrorisedâ by some repulsively deformed âgoblin-likeâcreature who regularly broke out of the Woodshead andcommitted an impressively wide range of unspeakable acts.
Like most people, Kate had assumed, insofar as she hadthought about it at all, that what had actually happened was thatsome poor bewildered mental patient had wandered out of thegrounds and given a couple of passing old ladies a bit of a turn,and that the slavering hacks of Wapping had done the rest. Nowshe was a little more shaky and a little less sure.
He - it - had known her name.
What could she make of that?
What she made of it was a wrong turning. In herpreoccupation she missed the turning that would take her
on tothe main road back to London, and then had to work out what todo about it. She could simply do a three- point turn and go back,but it was a long time since she had last put the car into reversegear, and she was frankly a bit nervous about how it would taketo it.
She tried taking the next two right turns to see if that wouldset her straight, but she had no great hopes of this actuallyworking, and was right not to have. She drove on for two orthree miles, knowing that she was on the wrong rmad but at least,judging from the position of the lighter grey smear in the greyclouds, going in the right direction.
After a while she settled down to this new route. A couple ofsignposts she passed made it clear to her that

she was merelytaking the B route back to London now, which she was perfectlyhappy to do. If she had thought about it in advance, she wouldprobably have chosen to do so anyway in preference to the busytrunk road.
The trip had been a total failure, and she would have done farbetter simply to have stayed soaking in the bath all afternoon.The whole experience had been thoroughly disturbing, vergingon the frightening, and she had drawn a complete blank as far asher actual objective was concemed. It was bad enough having anobjective that she could hardly bring herself to admit to, withouthaving it completely fall apart on her as well. A sense of stalefutility gradually closed in on her along with the generalgreyness of the sky.
She wondered if she was going very slightly mad. Her lifeseemed to have drifted completely out of her control in the lastfew days, and it was distressing to realise just how fragile hergrip was when it could so easily be shattered by a relativelyminor thunderbolt or meteorite or whatever it was.
The word âthunderboltâ seemed to have arrived in the middleof that thought without warning and she didnât know what tomake of it, so she just let it lie there at the bottom of her mind,like the towel lying on her bathroom floor that she hadnât beenbothered to pick up.
She longed for some sun to break through. The miles groundalong under her wheels, the clouds ground her down, and shefound herself increasingly thinking of penguins. At last she feltshe could stand it no more and decided that a few minutesâ walkwas what she needed to shake her out of her mood.
She stopped the car at the side of the road, and the elderlyJaguar which had been following her for the last seventeen milesran straight into the back of her, which worked just as well.

Dirk Gently 2 - The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul

Chapter 13
With a delicious shock of rage Kate leapt, invigorated, out of hercar and ran to harangue the driver of the other car who was, inturn, leaping out of his in order to harangue her.
âWhy donât you look where youâre going?â she yelled at him.He was a rather overweight man who had been driving wearinga long leather coat and a rather ugly red hat, despite the discom-fort this obviously involved. Kate warmed to him for it.
âWhy donât I look where Iârn going?â he replied heatedly.âDonât you look in your near-view mirror?â âNo,â said Kate, putting her fists on her hips.
âOh,â said her adversary. âWhy not?â
âBecause itâs under the seat.â
âI see,â he replied grimly. âThank you for being so frank withme. Do you have a lawyer?â
âYes I do, as a matter of fact,â said Kate. She said it with vimand hauteur.
âIs he any good?â said the man in the hat. âIâm going to needone. Mineâs popped into prison for a while.â âWell, you certainly canât have mine.â
âWhy not?â
âDonât be absurd. It would be a clear conflict of interest.â
Her adversary folded his arms and leant back against the bon-net of his car. He took his time to survey the
surroundings. Thelane was growing dim as the early winter evening began to settleon the land. He then leant into his car to turn on his hazardwarning indicators. The rear amber lights winked prettily on thescrubby grass of the roadside. The front lights were buried in therear of Kateâs Citron and were in no fit state to wink.
He resumed his leaning posture and looked Kate up and downappraisingly.
âYou are a driver,â he said, âand I use the word in the loosestpossible sense, i.e. meaning merely somebody who occupies thedriving seat of what I will for the moment call - but I use theterm strictly without prejudice - a car while it is proceedingalong the road, of stupendous, I would even say verging on thesuperhuman, lack of skill. Do you catch my drift?â
âNo.â
âI mean you do not drive well. Do you know youâve been allover the road for the last seventeen miles?â âSeventeen miles!â exclaimed Kate. âHave you been follow-ing me?â
âOnly up to a point,â said Dirk. âIâve tried to stay on this sideof the road.â
âI see. Well, thank you in turn for being so frank with me.This, I need hardly tell you, is an outrage. Youâd
better get your-self a damn good lawyer, because mineâs going to stick red-hotskewers in him.â
âPerhaps I should get myself a kebab instead.â
âYou look as if youâve had quite enough kebabs. May I askyou why you were following me?â
âYou looked as if you knew where you were going. To beginwith at least. For the first hundred yards or
so.â.
âWhat the hellâs it got to do with you where I was going?â
âNavigational technique of mine.â
Kate narrowed her eyes.
She was about to demand a full and instant explanation of thispreposterous remark when a passing white
Ford Sierra sloweddown beside them.
The driver wound down the window and leant out. âHad acrash then?â he shouted at them.
âYes.â
âHa!â he said and drove on.
A second or two later a Peugeot stopped by them.
âWho was that just now?â the driver asked them, in referenceto the previous driver who had just stopped. âI donât know,â said Dirk.
âOh,â said the driver. âYou look as if youâve bad a crash ofsome sort.â
âYes,â said Dirk.
âThought so,â said the driver and drove on.
âYou donât get the same quality of passers-by these days, doyou?â said Dirk to Kate.
âYou get hit by some real dogs, too,â said Kate. âI still wantto know why you were following me. You
realise that itâs hardfor me not to see you in the role of an extremely sinister sort of aperson.â
âThatâs easily explained,â said Dirk. âUsually I am. On thisoccasion, however, I simply got lost. I was forced to takeevasive action by a large grey oncoming van which took a pro-prietorial view of the road. I only

avoided it by nipping down aside lane in which I was then unable to reverse. A few turningslater nnd I was thoroughly lost. There is a school of thoughtwhich says that you should consult a map on these occasions,but to such people I merely say, `Ha! What if you have no mapto consult? What if you have a map but itâs of the Dordogne?âMy own strategy is to find a car, or the nearest equivalent, whichlooks as if it knows where itâs going and follow it. I rarely endup where I was intending to go, but often I end up somewherethat I needed to be. So what do you say to that?â
âPiffle.â
âA robust response. I salute you.â
âl was going to say that I do the same thing myself some-times, but Iâve decided not to admit that yet.â âVery wise,â said Dirk. âYou donât want to give away toomuch at this point. Play it enigmatic is my
advice.â
âI donât want your advice. Where were you trying to getbefore suddenly deciding that driving seventeen
miles in theopposite direction would help you get there?â âA place called the Woodshead.â
âAh, the mental hospital.â
âYou know it?â
âIâve been driving away from it for the last seventeen milesand I wish it was further. Which ward will you be in? I need toknow where to send the repair bill.â
âThey donât have wards,â said Dirk. âAnd I think they wouldbe distressed to hear you call it a mental hospital.â
âAnything that distresses âem is fine by me.â Dirk looked about him.
âA fine evening,â he said.
âNo it isnât.â
âI see,â said Dirk. âYou have, if I may say so, the air of oneto whom her day has not been a source of joy or spiritual enrich-ment.â
âToo damn right, it hasnât,â said Kate. âIâve had the sort ofday that would make St Francis of Assisi kick babies.Particularly if you include Tuesday in with today, which is thelast time I was actually conscious. And now look. My beautifulcar. The only thing I can say in favour of the whole shebang isthat at least Iâm not in Oslo.â
âI can see how that might cheer you.â
âI didnât say it cheered me. It just about stops me killing my-self. I might as well save myself the bother anyway, with peoplelike you so keen to do it for me.â
âYou were my able assistant, Miss Schechter.â
âStop doing that!â
âStop doing what?â
âMy name! Suddenly every stranger I meet knows my name.Would you guys please just quit knowing my
name for onesecond? How can a girl be enigmatic under these conditions?The only person I met who didnât seem to know my name wasthe only one I actually introduced myself to. All right,â she said,pointing an accusing finger at Dirk, âyouâre not supernatural, sojust tell me how you knew my name. Iâm not letting go of yourtie till you tell me.â
âYou havenât got hold of - â
âI have now, buster.â
âUnhand me!â
âWhy were you following me?â insisted Kate. âHow do youknow my name?â
âI was following you for exactly the reasons stated. As foryour name, my dear lady, you practically told
me yourself.â
âI did not.â
âI assure you, you did.â
âIâm still holding your tie.â
âIf you are meant to be in Oslo but have been unconscioussince Tuesday, then presumably you were at the
incredible ex-ploding check-in counter at Heathrow Terminal Two. It waswidely reported in the press. I expect you missed it throughbeing unconscious. I myself missed it through rampant apathy,but the events of today have rather forced it on my attention.â
Kate grudgingly let go of his tie, but continued to eye himwith suspicion. âOh yeah?â she said. âWhat events?â

âDisturbing ones,â said Dirk, brushing himself down. âEvenif what you had told me yourself had not been eoough to identifyyou, then the fact of your having also been today to visit theWoodshead clinched it for me. I gather from your mood ofbelligerent despondency that the man you were seeking was notthene.â
âWhat?â
âPlease, have it,â said Dirk, rapidly pulling off his tie andhanding it to her. âBy chance I ran into a nurse from your hospi-tal earlier today. My first encounter with her was one which, forvarious reasons, I was anxious to terminate abruptly. It was onlywhile I was standing on the pavement a minute or two later,fending off the local wildlife, that one of the words I had heardher say struck me, I may say, somewhat like a thunderbolt. Theidea was fantastically, wildly improbable. But like most fantas-tically, wildly improbable ideas it was at least as worthy ofconsideration as a more mundane one to which the facts hadbeen strenuously bent to fit.
âI returned to question her further, and she confirmed that asomewhat unusual patient had, in the early hours of the morning,been transferred from the hospital, apparently to the Woodshead.
âShe also confided to me that another patient had been almostindecently curious to find out what had become of him. Thatpatient was a Miss Kate Schechter, and I think you will agree,Miss Schechter, that my methods of navigation have their ad-vantages. I may not have gone where I intended to go, but Ithink I have ended up where I needed to be.â

Dirk Gently 2 - The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul

Chapter 14
After about half an hour a hefty man from the local garagearrived with a pick-up truck, a tow-rope and a son. Havinglooked at the situation he sent his son and the pick-up truckaway to deal with another job, attached the tow-rope to Kateâsnow defunct car and pulled it away to the garage himself.
Kate was a little quiet about this for a minute or two, and thensaid, âHe wouldnât have done that if I hadnât been anAmerican.â
He had recommended to them a small local pub where hewould come and look for them when he had made his diagnosison the Citron. Since Dirkâs Jaguar had only lost its front rightindicator light, and Dirk insisted that he hardly ever turned rightanyway, they drove the short distance there. As Kate, with somereluctance, climbed into Dirkâs car she found the Howard Bellbook which Dirk had purloined from Sally Mills in the caf, andpounced on it. A few minutes later, walking into the pub, shewas still trying to work out if it was one she had nead or not.
The pub combined all the traditional English quatities ofhorse brasses, Formica and surliness. The sound of MichaelJackson in the other bar mingled with the mournfulintermittence of the glass-cleaning machine in this one to createan aural ambience which perfectly matched the elderlypaintwork in its dinginess.
Dirk bought himself and Kate a drink each, and then joinedher at the small comer table she had found away from the fat, T-shirted hostility of the bar.
âI have read it,â she announced, having thumbed her way bynow through most of Run Like the Devil. âAt least, I started itand read the first couple of chapters. A couple of months ago, infact. I donât know why I still read his books. Itâs pcrfectly clearthat his editor doesnât.â She looked up at Dirk. âI wouldnât havethought it was your sort of thing. From what little I know ofyou.â
âIt isnât,â said Dirk. âI, er, picked it up by mistake.â
ââThatâs what everyone says,â replied Kate. âHe used to bequite good,â she added âif you liked that sort of thin. Mybrotherâs in publishing in New York, and he says Howard Bellâsgone very strange nowadays. I get the feeling that theyâre all alittle afraid of him and he quite likes that. Certainly no oneseems to have the guts to tell him he should cut chapters ten totwenty-seven inclusive. And all the stuff about the goat. Thetheory is that the reason he sells so many millions of copies isthat nobody ever does read them. If everyone who bought themactually read them theyâd never bother to buy the next one andhis career would be over.â
She pushed it away from her.
âAnyway,â she said, âyouâve very cleverly told me why Iwent to the Woodshead; you havenât told me why you weregoing there yourself.â
Dirk shrugged. âTo see what it was like,â he said, non-commitally.
âOh yes? Well, Iâll save you the bother. The place is quitehorrible.â
âDescribe it. In fact start with the airport.â
Kate took a hefty swig at her Bloody Mary and broodedsilently for a moment while the vodka marched
around insideher.
âYou want to hear about the airport as well?â she said at last.
âYes.â
Kate drained the rest of her drink.
âIâll need another one, then,â she said and pushed the emptyglass across at him.
Dirk braved the bug-eyedness of the batman and returned aminute or two later with a refill for Kate. âOK,â said Kate. âIâll start with the cat.â
âWhat cat?â
âThe cat I needed to ask the next-door neighbour to look afterfor me.â
âWhich next-door neighbour?â
âThe one that died.â
âI see,â said Dirk. âTell you what, why donât I just shut upand let you tell me?â
âYes,â said Kate, âthat would be good.â
Kate recounted the events of the last few days, or at least,those she was conscious for, and then moved on
to herimpressions of the Woodshead.
Despite the distaste with which she described it, it sounded toDirt like exactly the sort of place he would
love to retire to, ifpossible tomorrow. It combined a dedication to the inexplicable,which was his own persistent vice (he could only think of it assuch, and sometimes would rail against it with the fury of anaddict), with a pampered self-indulgence which was a vice towhich he would love to be able to aspire if he could ever

butafford it.
At last Kate related her disturbing encounter with Mr Odwinand his repellent minion, and it was as a result
of this that Dirkremained sunk in a frowning silence for a minute afterwards. Alarge part of this minute was in fact taken up with an internalstruggle about whether or not he was going to cave in and have acigarette. He had recendy foresworn them and the struggle was aregular one and he lost it regularly, often without noticing.
He decided, with triumph, that he would not have one, andthen took one out anyway. Fishing out his lighter from thecapacious pocket of his coat involved first taking out theenvelope he had removed from Geoffrey Aristeyâs bathroom. Heput it on the table next to the book and lit his cigarette.
âThe check-in girl at the airport...â he said at last.
âShe drove me mad,â said Kate, instantly. âShe just wentthrough the motions of doing her job like some kind of blankmachine. Wouldnât listen, wouldnât think. I donât know wherethey find people like that.â
âShe used to be my secretary, in fact,â said Dirk. âThey donâtseem to know where to find her now, either.â âOh. Iâm sorry,â said Kate immediately, and then reflectedfor a moment.
âI expect youâre going to say that she wasnât like that really âshe continued. âWell, thatâs possible. I
expect she was justshielding herself from the frustrations of her job. It must driveyou insensible working at an airport. I think I would havesympathised if I hadnât been so goddamn frustated myself. Iâmsorry, I didnât know. So thatâs what youâre trying to find outabout.â
Dirk gave a non-committal type of nod. âAmongst otherthings,â he said. Then he added, âIâm a private detective.â
âOh?â said Kate in surprise, and then looked puzzled. âDoes that bother you?â
âItâs just that I have a friend who plays the double bass.â âI see,â said Dirk.
âWhenever people meet him and heâs struggling arnund withit, they all say the same thing, and it drives him crazy. They allsay, `I bet you wished you played the piccolo.â Nobody everworks out that thatâs what everybody else says. I was just tryingto work out if there was something that everybody would alwayssay to a private detective, so that I could avoid saying it.â
âNo. What happens is that everybody looks very shifty for amoment, and you got that very well.â
âI see.â Kate looked disappointed. âWell, do you have anyclues - that is to say, any idea about whatâs happened to yoursecretary?â
âNo,â said Dirk, âno idea. Just a vague image that I donâtknow what to make of.â He toyed thoughtfully with hiscigarette, and then let his gaze wander over the table again andon to the book.
He picked it up and looked it over, wondering what impulsehad made him pick it up in the first place.
âI donât really know anything about Howard Bell,â he said.
Kate was surprised at the way he suddenly changed thesubject, but also a little relieved.
âI only know,â said Dirk, âthat he sells a lot of books and thatthey all look pretty much like this. What
should I know?â
âWell, there are some very strange stories about him.â
âLike what?â
âLike what he gets up to in hotel suites all across America.No one knows the details, of course, they just
get the bills andpay them because they donât like to ask. They feel theyâre onsafer ground if they donât know. Particularly about thechickens.â
âChickens?â said Dirk. âWhat chickens?â
âWell apparently,â said Kate, lowering her voice and leaningforward a little, âheâs always having live chickens delivered tohis hotel room.â
Dirk frowned.
âWhat on earth for?â he said.
âNobody knows. Nobody ever knows what happens to them.Nobody ever sees them again. Not,â she said,
leaning evenfurther forward, and dropping her voice still further, âa singlefeather.â
Dirk wondered if he was being hopelessly innocent and nave.
âSo what do people think heâs doing with them?â he asked.
âNobody,â Kate said, âhas the faintest idea. They donât evenwant to have the faintest idea. They just donât
know.â
She shrugged and picked the book up again herself.
âThe other thing David - thatâs my brother - says about himis that he has the absolute perfect bestsellerâs
name.â

âReally?â said Dirk. âIn what way?â
âDavid says itâs the first thing any publisher looks for in anew author. Not, `Is his stuff any good?â or, `Is his stuff anygood once you get rid of all the adjectives?â but, `Is his lastname nice and short and his first name just a bit longer?â Yousee? The `Bellâ is done in huge silver letters, and the `Howardâfits neatly across the top in slightly narrower ones. Instant trademark. Itâs publishing magic. Once youâve got a name like thatthen whether you can actually write or not is a minor matter.Which in Howard Bellâs case is now a significant bonus. But itâsa very ordinary name if you write it down in the normal way,like it is here you see.â
âWhat?â said Dirk.
âHere on this envelope of yours.â
âWhere? Let me see.â
âThatâs his name there, isnât it? Crossed out.â
âGood heavens, youâre right,â said Dirk, peering at theenvelope. âI suppose I didnât recognise it without
its trade markshape.â
âIs this something to do with him, then?â asked Kate, pickingit up and looking it over.
âI donât know what it is, exactly,â said Dirk. âItâs somethingto do with a contract, and it may be something
to do with arecord.â
âI can see it might be to do with a record.â
âHow can you see that?â asked Dirk, sharply.
âWell, this name here is Dennis Hutch, isnât it? See?â
âOh yes. Yes, I do,â said Dirk, examining it for himself. âEr,should I know that name?â
âWell,â said Kate slowly, âit depends if youâre alive or not, Isuppose. Heâs the head of the Aries Rising
Record Group. Lessfamous than the Pope, I grant you, but - you know of the Pope Itake it?â
âYes, yes,â said Dirk impatiently, âwhite-haired chap.â
âThatâs him. He seems to be about the only person of notethis envelope hasnât been addressed to at some
time. Hereâs StanDubcek, the head of Dubcek, Danton, Heidegger, Draycott. Iknow they handle the ARRGH! account.â
âThe...?â
âARRGH! Aries Rising Record Group Holdings. Getting thataccount made the agencyâs fortunes.â
She looked at Dirk.
âYou have the air,â she stated, âof one who knows little ofthe record business or the advertising business.â âI have that honour,â said Dirk, graciously inclining his head.
âSo what are you doing with this?â
âWhen I manage to get it open, Iâll know,â said Dirk. âDoyou have a knife on you?â
Kate shook her head.
âWhoâs Geoffrey Anstey, then?â she asked. âHeâs the onlyname not crossed out. Friend of yours?â
Dirk paled a little and didnât immediately answer. Then hesaid, âThis strange person you mentioned, this
`SomethingNasty in the Woodsheadâ creature. Tell me again what he said toyou.â
âHe said, `I, too, have the advantage of you, MissSchechter.ââ Kate tried to shrug.
Dirk weighed his thoughts uncertainly for a moment.
âI think it is just possible,â he said at last, âthat you may be insome kind of danger.â
âYou mean itâs possible that passing lunatics may crash intome in the road? That kind of danger?â âMaybe even worse.â
âOh yeah?â
âYes.â
âAnd what makes you think that?â
âItâs not entirely clear to me yet,â replied Dirk with a frown.âMost of the ideas I have at the moment have
to do with thingsthat are completely impossible, so I am wary about sharingthem. They are, however, the only thoughts I have.â
âIâd get some different ones, then,â said Kate. âWhat was theSherlock Holmes principle? `Once you have discounted theimpossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, mustbe the truth.ââ
âI reject that entirely,â said Dirk, sharply. âThe impossibleoften has a kind of integrity to it which the merely improbablelacks. How often have you been presented with an apparentlyrational explanation of something which works in all respectsother than one, which is just that it is hopelessly improbable?Your instinct is to say, `Yes, but he or she simply wouldnât dothat.ââ
âWell, it happened to me today, in fact,â replied Kate.
âAh yes,â said Dirk, slapping the table and making theglasses jump, âyour girl in the wheelchair - a

perfect example.The idea that she is somehow receiving yesterdayâs stock marketprices apparently out of thin air is merely impossible, andtherefore must be the case, because the idea that she ismaintaining an immensely complex and laborious hoax of nobenefit to herself is hopelessly improbable. The first idea merelysupposes that there is something we donât know about, and Godknows there are enough of those. The second, however, runscontrary to something fundamental and human which we doknow about. We should therefore be very suspicious of it and allits specious rationality.â
âBut you wonât tell me what you think.â
âNo.â
âWhy not?â
âBecause it sounds ridiculous. But I think you are in danger. Ithink you might be in horrible danger.â âGreat. So what do you suggest I do about it?â said Katetaking a sip of her second drink, which otherwise
had stayedalmost untouched.
âI suggest,â said Dirk seriously, âthat you come back toLondon and spend the night in my house.â
Kate hooted with laughter and then had to fish out a Kleenexto wipe tomato juice off herself.
âIâm sorry, what is so extraordinary about that?â demandedDirk, rather taken aback.
âItâs just the most wonderfully perfunctory pick-up line Iâveever heard.â She smiled at him. âIâm afraid
the answer is aresounding `noâ.â
He was, she thought, interesting, entertaining in an eccentrickind of way, but also hideously unattractive to
her.
Dirk felt very awkward. âI think there has been someappalling misunderstanding,â he said. âAllow me to
explainthat - â
He was interrupted by the sudden arrival in their midst of themechanic from the garage with news of
Kateâs car.
âFixed it,â he said. âIn fact there were nothing to fix otherthan the bumper. Nothing new that is. The funny
noise youmentioned were just the engine. But itâll go all right. You justhave to rev her up, let in the ctutch, and then wait for a little bitlonger than you might normally expect.â
Kate thanked him a little stiffly for this advice and theninsisted on atlowing Dirk to pay the ?25 he was charging for it.
Outside, in the car park, Dirk repeated his urgent request thatKate should go with him, but she was adamant that all sheneeded was a good nightâs sleep and that everything would lookbright and clear and easily capable of being coped with in themorning.
Dirk insisted that they should at least exchange phonenumbers. Kate agreed to this on condition that Dirk foundanother route back to London and didnât sit on her tail.
âBe very careful,â Dirk called to her as her car grumbled outon to the road.
âI will,â shouted Kate, âand if anything impossible happens, Ipromise youâll be the first to know.â
For a brief moment, the yellow undulations of the cargleamed dully in the light leaking from the pub
windows andstood out against the heavily hunched greyness of the night skywhich soon swallowed it up. Dirk tried to follow her, but his car wouldnât start.

Dirk Gently 2 - The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul

Chapter 15
The clouds sank more heavily over the land, clenching into hugesullen towers, as Dirk, in a sudden excess of alarm, had to callout the man from the garage once again. He was slower to arrivewith his truck this time and bad-tempered with drink when atlast he did.
He emitted a few intemperate barks of laughter at Dirkâspredicament, then fumbled the bonnet of his car open andsubjected him to all kinds of muttered talk about manifolds,pumps, alternators and starlings and resolutely would not bedrawn on whether or not he was going to be able to get the thingto go again that night.
Dirk was unable to get a meaningful answer, or at least ananswer that meant anything to him, as to what was causing therumpus in the alternator, what ailed the fuel pump, in what waythe operation of the starter motor was being disrupted and whythe timing was off.
He did at last understand that the mechanic was also claimingthat a family of starlings had at some time in the past made theirnest in a sensitive part of the engineâs workings and hadsubsequently perished horribly, taking sensitive parts of theengine with them, and at this point Dirk began to cast abouthimself desperatety for what to do.
He noticed that the mechanicâs pick-up truck was standingnearby with its engine still running, and elected to make off withthis instead. Being a slightly less slow and cumbersome runnerthan the mechanic he was able to put this plan into operationwith a minimum of difficulty.
He swung out into the lane, drove off into the night andparked three miles down the road. He left the vanâs lights on, letdown its tyres and hid himself behind a tree. After about tenminutes his Jaguar came hurtling round the corner, passed thevan, hauled itself to an abrupt halt and reversed wildly backtowards it. The mechanic threw open the door, leapt out andhurried over to reclaim his property, leaving Dirk with theopportunity he needed to leap from behind the tree and reclaimhis own.
He spun his wheels pointedly and drove off in a kind of grimtriumph, still haunted, nevertheless, by anxieties to which hewas unable:to give a name or shape.
Kate, in the meantime, had joined the dimly glowing yellowstream that led on eventually through the westem suburbs ofActon and Ealing and into the heart of London. She crawled upover the Westway flyover and soon afterwards turned north uptowards Primrose Hill and home.
She always enjoyed driving up alongside the park, and thedark night shapes of the trees soothed her and made her long forthe quietness of her bed.
She found the nearest parking space she could to her frontdoor, which was about thirty yards distant. She climbed out ofthe car and carefully omitted to lock it. She never left anythingof value in it, and she found that it was to her advantage ifpeople didnât have to break anything in order to find that out.The car had been stolen twice, but on each occasion it had beenfound abandoned twenty yards away.
She didnât go straight home but set off instead in the oppositedirection to get some milk and bin liners frmm the small cornershop in the next street. She agreed with the gentle-facedPakistani who ran it that she did indeed look tired, and shouldhave an early night, but on the way back she made another smalldiversion to go and lean against the railings of the park, gazeinto its darkness for a few minutes, and breathe in some of itscold, heavy night air. At last she started to head back towardsher flat. She turned into her own road and as she passed the firststreet lamp it flickered and went out, leaving her in a small poolof darkness.
That sort of thing always gives one a nasty turn.
It is said that there is nothing surprising about the notion of,for instance, a person suddenly thinking about someone theyhavenât thought about for years, and then discovering the nextday that the person has in fact just died. There are always lots ofpeople suddenly remembering people they havenât thoughtabout for ages, and always lots of people dying. In a populationthe size of, say, America the law of averages means that thisparticular coincidence must happen at least ten times a day, butit is none the less spooky to anyone who experiences it.
By the same token, there are light bulbs burning out in streetlamps all the time, and a fair few of them must go pop just assomeone is passing beneath them. Even so, it still gives theperson concerned a nasty tum, especially when the very nextstreet lamp they pass under does exactly the same thing.
Kate stood rooted to the spot.
If one coincidence can occur, she told herself, then anothercoincidence can occur. And if one coincidence happens to occurjust after another coincidence, then that is just a coincidence.There was absolutely nothing to feel alarmed about in having acouple of street lamps go pop. She was in a perfectly normalfriendly street with houses all around her with their lights on.She looked up at the house next to her, unfortunately just as thelights

in its front window chanced to go out. This waspresumably because the occupants happened to choose thatmoment to leave the room, but though it just went to show whata truly extraordinary thing coincidence can be it did tittle toimprove her state of mind.
The rest of the street was still bathed in a dim yellow glow. Itwas only the few feet immediatety around her that weresuddenly dark. The next pool of light was just a few footstepsaway in front of her. She took a deep breath, pulled herselftogether, and walked towards it, reaching its very centre at theexact instant that it, too, extinguished itself.
The occupants of the two houses she had passed on the wayalso happened to choose that moment to leave their front rooms,as did their neighbours on the opposite side of the street.
Perhaps a poputar television show had just finished. Thatâswhat it was. Evervone was getting up and turning off their TVsets and lights simultaneously, and the resulting power surgewas blowing some of the street lamps. Something like that. Theresulting power surge was also making her blood pound a little.She moved on, trying to be calm. As soon as she got home sheâdhave a look in the paper to see what the programme had beenthat had caused three street lamps to blow.
Four.
She stopped and stood absolutely stitl under the dark lamp.More houses were darkening. What she found particulartyalarming was that they darkened at the very moment that shelooked at them.
Glance - pop.
She tried it again.
Glance - pop.
Each one she looked at darkened instantly.
Glance - pop.
She realised with a sudden start of fear that she must stopherself looking at the ones that were still lit. The
rationalisationsshe had been trying to construct were now running around insideher head screaming to be let out and she let them go. She tried tolock her eyes to the ground for fear of extinguishing the wholestreet, but couldnât help tiny glances to see if it was working.
Glance - pop.
She froze her gaze, down on to the narrow path forward. Mostof the road was dark now.
There were three remaining street lamps between her and thefront door which led to her own flat. Though
she kept her eyesaverted, she thought she could detect on the periphery of hervision that the lights of the flat downstairs from hers were lit.
Neil lived there. She couldnât remember his last name, but hewas a part-time bass-player and antiques dealer who used to giveher decorating advice she didnât want and also stole her milk -so her relationship with him had always remained at a slightlyfrosty level. Just at the moment, though, she was praying that hewas there to tell her what was wrong with her sofa, and that hislight would not go out as her eyes wavered from the pavement infront of her, with its three remaining pools of light spacedevenly along the way she had to tread.
For a moment she tried turning, and looked back the way shehad come. All was darkness, shading off into the blackness ofthe park which no longer calmed but menaced her, withhideously imagined thick, knotted roots and treacherous, dark,rotting litter.
Again she turned, sweeping her eyes low.
Three pools of light.
The street lights did not extinguish as she looked at them,only as she passed.
She squeezed her eyes closed and visualised exactly wherethe lamp of the next street light was, above and
in front of her.She raised her head, and carefully opened her eyes again, staringdirectly into the orange glow radiating through the thick glass.
It shone steadily.
With her eyes locked fast on it so that it burnt squiggles onher retina, she moved cautiously forward, step by step, exertingher will on it to stay burning as she approached. It continued toglow.
She stepped forward again. It continued to glow. Again shestepped, still it glowed. Now she was almost beneath it, craningher neck to keep it in focus.
She moved forward once more, and saw the filament withinthe glass flicker and quickly die away, leaving an after-imageprancing madly in her eyes.
She dropped her eyes now and tried looking steadily forward,but wild shapes were leaping everywhere and she felt she waslosing control. The next lamp she took a lunging run towards,and again, sudden darkness enveloped her arrival. She stoppedthere panting, and blinking, trying to calm herself again and gether vision sorted out. Looking towards the last street lamp, shethought she saw a figure standing beneath it. It was a large

form,silhouetted with jumping orange shadows. Huge horns stoodupon the figureâs head.
She stated with mad intensity into the billowing darkness,and suddenly screamed at it, âWho are you?â There was a pause, and then a deep answering voice said,âDo you have anything that can get these bits of
floorboard offmy back?â

Dirk Gently 2 - The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul

Chapter 16
There was another pause, of a different and slightly disorderedquality.
It was a long one. lt hung there nervously, wondering whichdirection it was going to get broken from. The darkened streettook on a withdrawn, defensive aspect.
âWhat?â Kate screamed back at the figure, at last. âI said...what?â
The great figure stirred. Kate still could not see him properlybecause her eyes were still dancing with blue shadows, searedthere by the orange light.
â1 was,â said the figure, âglued to the floor. My father - â
âDid you...are you...â Kate quivered with incoherent rageâare you responsible. . .for all this?â She turned and swept anangry hand around the street to indicate the nightmare she hadjust traversed.
âIt is important that you know who I am.â
âOh yeah?â said Kate. âWell letâs get the name down rightnow so I can take it straight to the police and get you done forbreach of something wilful or other. Intimidation. Interferingwith - â
âI am Thor. I am the God of Thunder. The God of Rain. TheGod of the High Towering Clouds. The God of Lightning. TheGod of the Flowing Currents. The God of the Particles. The Godof the Shaping and the Binding Forces. The God of the Wind.The God of the Growing Crops. The God of the HammerMjollnir.â
âAre you?â simmered Kate. âWell, Iâve no doubt that ifyouâd picked a slack moment to mention all that, I might havetaken an interest, but right now it just makes me very angry.Turn the damn lights on!â
âI am - â
âI said turn the lights on!â
With something of a sheepish glow, the streetlights all cameback on, and the windows of the houses all
quietly illuminatedthemselves once more. The lamp above Kate popped againalmost immediately. She shot him a warning look.
âIt was an old light, and infirm,â he said.
She simply continued to glare at him.
âSee,â he said, âI have your address.â He held out the pieceof paper she had given him at the airport, as if
that somehowexplained everything and put the world to rights. âI - â
âBack!â he shouted, throwing up his arms in front of his face.
âWhat?â
With a huge rush of wind a swooping eagle dropped from outof the night sky, with its talons outspread to
catch at him. Thorbeat and thrashed at it until the great bird flailed backwards,turned, nearly crashed to the ground, recovered itself, and withgreat slow beats of its wings, heaved itself back up through theair and perched on top of the street lamp. It grasped the lamphard with its talons and steadied itself, making the wholelamppost quiver very slightly in its grip.
âGo!â shouted Thor at it.
The eagle sat there and peered down at him. A monstrouscreature made more monstrous by the effect of the orange lighton which it perched, casting huge, flapping shadows on thenearby houses, it had strange circular markings on its wings.These were markings that Kate wondered if she had seen before,only in a nightmare, but then again, she was by no means certainthat she was not in a nightmare now.
There was no doubt that she had found the man she waslooking for. The same huge form, the same glacial eyes, thesame look of arrogant exasperation and slight muddle, only thistime his feet were plunged into huge hide boots, great furs,straps and thongs hung from his shoulders, a huge steel hornedhelmet stood on his head, and his exasperation was directed thistime not at an airline check-in girl but at a huge eagle perchedon a lamppost in the middle of Primrose Hill.
âGo,â he shouted at it again. âThe matter is beyond mypower! All that I can do I have done! Your family is providedfor. You I can do nothing more for! I myself am powerless andsick.â
Kate was suddenly shocked to see that there were greatgouges on the big manâs left forearm where the eagle had got itstalons into him and ripped them through his skin. Blood waswelling up out of them like bread out of a baking tin.
âGo!â he shouted again. With the edge of one hand hescraped the blood off his other arm and flung the heavy drops atthe eagle, which reared back, flapping, but retained its hold.Suddenly the man leapt high into the air and grappled himself tothe top of the lamppost, which now began to shake dangerouslyunder their combined weight. With loud cries the eagle peckedviciously at him while he tried with great swings of his free armto

sweep it from its perch.
A door opened. It was the front door of Kateâs house and aman with grey-rimmed spectacles and a neat
moustache lookedout. It was Neil, Kateâs downstairs neighbour, in a mood.
âLook, I really think - â he started. However, it quicklybecame clear that he simply didnât know what to
think andretreated back indoors, taking his mood, unsatisfied, with him.
The big man braced himself, and with a huge leap hurledhimself through the air and landed with a slight,
controlledwobble on top of the next lamppost, which bent slightly underhis weight. He crouched, glaring at the eagle, which glared back.
âGo!â he shouted again, brandishing his arm at it.
âGaarh!â it screeched back at him.
With another swing of his arm he pulled from under his furs agreat short-handled sledge-hammer and
hefted its great weightmeaningfully from one hand to another. The head of the hammerwas a roughly cast piece of iron about the size and shape of apint of beer in a big glass mug, and its shaft was a stocky, wrist-thick piece of ancient oak with leather strapping bound about itshandle.
âGaaaarrrh!â screeched the eagle again, but regarded thesledgehammer with keen-eyed suspicion. As Thor began slowlyto swing the hammer, the eagle shifted its weight tensely fromone leg to the other, in time to the rhythm of the swings.
âGo!â said Thor again, more, quietly, but with greatermenace. He rose to his full height on top of the lamppost, andswung the hammer faster and faster in a great circle. Suddenlyhe hurled it directly towards the eagle. In the same instant a boltof high voltage electricity erupted from the lamp on which theeagle was sitting, causing it to leap with loud cries wildly intothe air. The hammer sailed harmlessly under the lamp, swung upinto the air and out over the darkness of the park, while Thor,released of its weight, wobbled and tottered on top of hislamppost, spun round and regained his balance. Flailing madlyat the air with its huge wings, the eagle, too, regained control ofitself, flew upwards, made one last diving attack on Thor, whichthe god leapt backwards off the lamppost to avoid, and thenclimbed up and away into the night sky in which it quicklybecame a small, dark speck, and then at last was gone.
The hammer came bounding back from out of the sky,scraped flying sparks from the paving-stones with its head,turned over twice in the air and then dropped its head back to theground next to Kate and nested its shaft gently against her leg.
An elderly lady who had been waiting patiently with her dogin the shadows beneath the street lamp, which was now defunct,sensed, correctly, that all of the excitement was now over andproceeded quietly past them. Thor waited politely till they hadpassed and then approached Kate, who stood with her armsfolded watching him. After all the business of the last two orthree minutes he seemed suddenly not to have the faintest ideawhat to say and for the moment merely gazed thoughtfully intothe middle distance.
Kate formed the distinct impression that thinking was, forhim, a separate activity from everything else, a task that neededits own space. It could not easily be combined with otheractivities such as walking or talking or buying airline tickets.
âWeâd better take a look at your arm,â she said, and led theway up the steps to her house. He followed, docile.
As she opened the front door she found Neil in the hallleaning his back against the wall and looking with grimpointedness at a Coca-Cola vending machine standing againstthe opposite wall and taking up an inordinate amount of space inthe hallway.
âI donât know what weâre going to do about this, I reallydonât,â he said.
âWhatâs it doing there?â asked Kate.
âWell, thatâs what Iâm asking you, Iâm afraid,â said Neil. âIdonât know how youâre going to get it up the
stairs. Donât seehow it can be done to be perfectly frank with you. And letâs faceit, I donât think youâre going to like it once youâve got it upthere. I know itâs very modern and American, but think about it,youâve got that nice French cherrywood table, that sofa whichwill be very nice once youâve taken off that dreadful CollierCampbell covering like I keep on saying you should, only youwonât listen, and I just donât see that itâs going to fit in, not ineither sense. And Iâm not even sure that I should allow it, I meanitâs a very heavy object and you know what Iâve said to youabout the floors in this house. Iâd think again, I really would,you know.â
âYes, Neil, how did it get here?â
âWell, your friend here delivered it just an hour or so ago. Idonât know where heâs been working out, but I must say Iwouldnât mind paying his gym a visit. I said I thought the wholething was very doubtful but he would insist and in the end I evenhad to give him a hand. But I must say that I think we need tohave a very serious think about the whole topic. I asked yourfriend if he liked Wagner but he didnât respond very well. So,

Idonât know, what do you want to do about it?â
Kate took a deep breath. She suggested to her huge guest thathe carry on upstairs and she would see him in
just a moment.Thor lumbered past, and was an absurd figure mounting thestairs.
Neil watched Kateâs eyes very closely for a clue as to what,exactly, was going on, but Kate was as blank
as she knew how.
âIâm sorry, Neil,â she said, matter-of-factly. âThe Cokemachine will go. Itâs all a misunderstanding. Iâll
get this sortedout by tomorrow.â
âYes, thatâs all very well,â said Neil, âbut where does all thisleave me? I mean, you see my problem.â âNo, Neil, I donât.â
âWell, Iâve got this...thing out here, youâve got that...personupstairs, and the whole thing is just a total
disruption.â
âIs there anything I can do to make anything any better?â
âWell itâs not as easy as that, is it? I mean, I think you shouldjust think about it a bit, thatâs all. I mean, all
this. You told meyou were going away. I heard the bath running this afternoon.What was I to think? And after you had gone on about the cat,and you know I wonât work with cats.â
âI know; Neil. Thatâs why I asked Mrs Grey next door to lookafter her.â
âYes, and look what happened to her. Died of a heart attack.Mr Greyâs very upset, you know.â
âI donât think it had anything to do with me asking her if shewould look after my cat.â
âWell, all I can say is that heâs very upset.â
âYes, Neil. His wifeâs died.â
âWell, Iâm not saying anything. Iâm just saying I think youshould think about it. And what on earth are we
going to doabout all this?â he added, re-addressing his attention to theCoca-Cola machine.
âIâve said that I will make sure itâs gone in the morningNeil,â said Kate. âIâm quite happy to stand here
and scream veryloudly if you think it will help in any way, but - â
âListen, love, Iâm only making the point. And I hope youârenot going to be making a lot of noise up there
because Iâve gotto practise my music tonight, and you know that I need quiet toconcentrate.â He gave Kate a meaningful look over the top ofhis glasses and disappeared into his flat.
Kate stood and silently counted as much of one to ten as shecould currently remember and then headed staunchly up thestairs in the wake of the God of Thunder, feeling that she wasnot in a mood for either weather or theology. The house beganto throb and shake to the sound of the main theme of The Ride ofthe Valkyries being played on a Fender Precision bass.

Dirk Gently 2 - The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul

Chapter 17
As Dirk edged his way along the Euston Road, caught in themiddle of a rush hour traffic jam that had started in the latenineteen seventies and which, at a quarter to ten on thisThursday evening, still showed no signs of abating, he thoughthe caught sight of something he recognised.
It was his subconscious which told him this - that infuriatingpart of a personâs brain which never responds to interrogationmerely gives little meaningful nudges and then sits hummingquietly to itself, saying nothing.
âWell of course Iâve just seen something I recognise,â Dirkmuttered mentally to his subconscious. âI drive along thisbenighted thoroughfare twenty times a month. I expect Irecognise every single matchstick lying in the gutter. Canât yoube a little more specific?â His subconscious would not behectored though, and was dumb. It had nothing further to add.The city was probably full of grey vans anyway. Veryunremarkable.
âWhere?â muttered Dirk to himself fiercely, twisting round inhis seat this way and that. âWhere did I see a grey van?â
Nothing.
He was thoroughly hemmed in by the traffic and could notmanoeuvre in any direction, least of all forward. He eruptedfrom his car and started to jostle his way back through thejammed cars bobbing up and down to try and see where, ifanywhere, he might have caught a glimpse of a grey van. If hehad seen one, it eluded him now. His subconscious sat and saidnothing.
The traffic was still not moving, so he tried to thread his wayfurther back, but was obstructed by a large motorcycle courieredging his way forward on a huge grimy Kawasaki. Dirkengaged in a brief altercation with the courier, but lost it becausethe courier was unable to hear Dirkâs side of the altercation;eventually Dirk retreated through the tide of traffic which nowwas beginning slowly to move in all lanes other than the one inwhich his car sat, driverless, immobile and hooted at.
He felt suddenly elated by the braying of the motor horns,and as he swayed and bobbed his way back through the snarledup columns of cars, he suddenly found that he reminded himselfof the crazies he had seen on the streets of New York, whowould career out into the road to explain to the oncoming trafficabout the Day of Judgement, imminent alien invasions and in-competence and corruption in the Pentagon. He put his handsabove his head and started to shout out, âThe Gods are walkingthe Earth! The Gods are walking the Earth!â
This further inflamed the feelings of those who were beepingtheir horns at his stationary car, and quickly the whole rosethrough a crescendo of majestic cacophony, with Dirkâs voiceringing out above it.
ââThe Gods are walking the Earth! The Gods are walking theEarth!â he hollered. âThe Gods are walking the Earth ! Thankyou!â he added, and ducked down into his car, put it into Driveand pulled away, allowing the whole jammed mass at last toseethe easily forward.
He wondered why he was so sure. An âAct of Godâ. Merety achance, careless phrase by which people were able to disposeconveniently of awkward phenomena that would admit of nomore rational explanation. But it was the chance carelessness ofit which particularly appealed to Dirk because words used care-lessly, as if they did not matter in any serious way, often allowedotherwise well-guarded truths to seep through.
Ao inexplicable disappearance. Oslo and a hammer: a tiny,tiny coincidence which struck a tiny, tiny note. However, it wasa note which sang in the midst of the daily hubbub of whitenoise, and other tiny notes were singing at the same pitch. AnAct of God, Oslo, and a hammer. A man with a hammer, tryingto go to Norway, is prevented, loses his temper, and as a resultthere is an âAct of Godâ.
If, thought Dirk, if a being were immortal he would still bealive today. That, quite simply, was what âimmortalâ meant.
How would an immortal being have a passport?
Quite simpty, how? Dirk tried to imagine what might happenif - to pick a name quite at random - the God Thor, he of theNorwegian ancestry and the great hammer, were to arrive at thepassport office and try to explain who he was and how come hehad no birth certificate. There would be no shock, no horror, noloud exclamations of astonishment, just blank, bureaucraticimpossibility. It wouldnât be a matter of whether anybodybelieved him or not, it would simply be a question of producinga valid birth certificate. He coutd stand there wreaking miraclesall day if he liked but at close of business, if he didnât have avalid birth certificate, he would simply be asked to leave.
And credit cards.
If, to sustain for a moment the same arbitrary hypothesis, theGod Thor were alive and for some reason at large in England,then he would probably be the only person in the country whodid not receive the constant

barrage of invitations to apply for anAmerican Express card, crude threats by the same post to taketheir American Express cards away, and gift catalogues full ofsumptuously unpleasant things, lavishly tooled in naff brownplastic.
Dirk found the idea quite breathtaking.
That is, if he were the only god at large - which, once youwere to accept the first extravagant hypothesis, was hardly likelyto be the case.
But imagine for a moment such a person attempting to leavethe country, armed with no passport, no credit cards, merely thepower to throw thunderbolts and who knew what else. Youwould probably have to imagine a scene very similar to the onethat did in fact occur at Terminal Two, Heathrow.
But why, if you were a Norse god, would you be needing toleave the country by means of a scheduled airline? Surely therewere other means? Dirk rather thought that one of the perks ofbeing an immortal divine might be the ability to fly under yourown power. From what he remembered of his reading of theNorse legends many years ago, the gods were continually flyingall over the place and there was never any mention of themhanging around in departure lounges eating crummy buns.Admittedly, the world was not, in those days, bristling with air-traffic controllers, radar, missile warning systems and such like.Still, a quick hop across the North Sea shouldnât be that much ofa problem for a god, particularly if the weather was in yourfavour, which, if you were the God of Thunder, you wouldpretty much expect it to be, or want to know the reason why.Should it?
Another tiny note sang in the back of Dirkâs mind and thenwas lost in the hubbub.
He wondered for a moment what it was like to be a whale.Physically, he thought, he was probably well placed to get somegood insights, though whales were better adapted for their livesof gliding about in the vast pelagic blueness than he was for hisof struggling up through the Pentonville Road traffic in a wearyold Jaguar - but what he was thinking of, in fact, was thewhalesâ songs. In the past the whales had been able to sing toeach other across whole oceans, even from one ocean to anotherbecause sound travels such huge distances underwater. But now,again because of the way in which sound travels, there is no partof the ocean that is not constantly jangling with the hubbub ofshipsâ motors, through which it is now virtually impossible forthe whales to hear each otherâs songs or messages.
So fucking what, is pretty much the way that people tend toview this problem, and understandably so, thought Dirk. Afterall, who wants to hear a bunch of fat fish, oh all right, mammals,burping at each other?
But for a moment Dirk had a sense of infinite loss andsadness that somewhere amongst the frenzy of information noisethat daily rattled the lives of men he thought he might haveheard a few notes that denoted the movements of gods.
As he turned north into Islington and began the long haul uppast the pizza restaurants and estate agents, he felt almost franticat the idea of what their lives must now be like.

Dirk Gently 2 - The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul

Chapter 18
Thin fingers of lightning spread out across the heavy undersideof the great clouds which hung from the sky like a saggingstomach. A small crack of fretful thunder nagged at it anddragged from it a few mean drops of greasy drizzle.
Beneath the sky ranged a vast assortment of wild turrets,gnarled spires and pinnacles which prodded at it, goaded andinflamed it till it seemed it would burst and drown them in aflood of festering horrors.
High in the flickering darkness, silent figures stood guardbehind long shields, dragons crouched gaping at the foul sky asOdin, father of the Gods of Asgard, approached the great ironportals through which led to his domain and on into the vaultedhalls of Valhalla: The air was full of the noiseless howls of greatwinged dogs, welcoming their master to the seat of his rule.Lightning searched among the towers and turrets.
The great, ancient and immortal God of Asgard was returningto the current site of his domain in a manner that would havesurprised even him centuries ago in the years of the prime of hislife - for even the immortal gods have their primes, when theirpowers are rampant and they both nourish and hold sway overthe world of men, the world whose needs give them birth - hewas returning in a large, unmarked grey Mercedes van.
The van drew to a halt in a secluded area.
The cab door opened and there climbed down from it a dull,slow-faced man in an unmarked grey uniform. He was a manwho was charged with the work he did in life because he wasnot one to ask questions - not so much on account of any naturalquality of discretion as because he simply could never think ofany questions to ask. Moving with a slow, rolling gait, like apaddle being pulled through porridge, he made his way to therear of the van and opened the rear doors - an elaborateprocedune involving the co-ordinated manipulation of manysliders and levers.
At length the doors swung open, and if Kate had been presentshe might for a moment have been jolted by the thought thatperhaps the van was carrying Albanian electricity after all. Ahaze of light greeted Hillow - the manâs. name was Hillow - butnothing about this struck him as odd. A haze of light was simplywhat he expected to see whenever he opened this door. The firsttime ever he had opened it he had simply thought to himself,âOh. A haze of light. Oh well,â and more or less Ieft it at that, onthe strength of which he had guaranteed himself regularemployment for as long as he cared to live.
The haze of light subsided and coalesced into the shape of anold, old man in a trolley bed attended by a short little figurewhom HiIlow would probably have thought was the most evil-looking person he had ever seen if he had had a mind to recallthe other people he had seen in his life and run through them allone by one, making the comparison. That, however, was harderthan Hillow wished to work. His only concern at present was toassist the small figure with the decanting of the old manâs bed onto ground leveI.
This was fluently achieved. The legs and wheels of the bedwere a miracle of smoothly operating stainless steel technology.They unlocked, rolled, swivelled, in elaborately interlockedmovements which made the negotiating of steps or bumps allpart of the same fluid, gliding motion.
To the right of this area lay a large ante-chamber panelled infinely carved wood with great marble torch holders standingproudly from the walls. This in turn led into the great vaultedhall itself. To the left, however, lay the entrance to the majesticinner chambers where Odin would go to prepare himself for theencounters of the night.
He hated all this. Hounded from his bed, he muttered tohimself, though in truth he was bringing his bed with him. Madeto listen once again to all kinds of self indulgent clap-trap fromhis bone-headed thunderous son who would not accept, couldnot accept, simply did not have the intelligence to accept thenew realities of life. If he would not accept them then he must beextinguished, and tonight Asgard would see the extinction of animmortal god. It was all, thought Odin fractiously, too much forsomeone at his time of life, which was extremely advanced, butnot in any particular direction.
He wanted merely to stay in his hospital, which he loved. Thearrangement which had brought him to that place was of thesweetest kind and though it was not without its cost, it was acost that simply had to be borne and that was all there was to it.There were new realities, and he had learned to embrace them.Those who did not would simply have to suffer theconsequences. Nothing came of nothing, even for a god.
Aher tonight he could return to his life in the Woodsheadindefinitely, and that would be good. He said as much to Hillow.
âClean white sheets,â he said to Hillow, who merely nodded,blankly. âLinen sheets. Every day, clean sheets.â
Hillow manoeuvred the bed arnund and up a step.

âBeing a god, Hillow,â continued Odin, âbeing a god, well, itwas unclean, you hear what Iâm saying? There was no one whotook care of the sheets. I mean really took care of them. Wouldyou think that? In a situation like mine? Father of the Gods?There was no one, absolutely no one, who came in and said, `MrOdwin,ââ - he chuckled to himself - âthey call me Mr Odwinthere, you know. They donât quite know who theyâre dealingwith. I donât think they could handle it, do you, Hillow? Butthere was no one in all that time who came in and said, `MrOdwin, I have changed your bed and you have clean sheets.â Noone. There was constant talk about hewing things and ravagingthings and splitting things asunder. Lots of big talk of thingsbeing mighty, and of things being riven, and of things being inthrall to other things, but very little attention given, as I nowrealise, to the laundry. Let me give you an example...â
His reminiscences were for a moment interrupted, however,by the arrival of his vehicle at a great doorway which wasguarded by a great sweaty splodge of a being who stoodswaying, arms akimbo, in their path. Toe Rag, who had beenpreserving an intense silence as he stalked along just ahead ofthe bed, hurried forward and had a quick word with the sweatingcreature, who had to bend, red-faced, to hear him. Then instantlythe sweaty creature shrank back with glistening obsequiousnessinto its yellow lair, and the sacred trolley rolled forward into thegreat halls, chambers and corridors from which great gustyechoes roared and fetid odours blew.
âLet me give you an example, Hillow,â continued Odin.âTake this place for example. Take Valhalla. . .â

Dirk Gently 2 - The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul

Chapter 19
Turning north was a manoeuvre which normally had the effectof restoring a sense of reason and sanity to things, but Dirkcould not escape a sense of foreboding.
Furthermore it came on to rain a little, which should havehelped, but it was such mean and wretched rain to come fromsuch a heavy sky that it only increased the sense ofclaustrophobia and frustration which gripped the night. Dirkturned on the car wipers which grumbled because they didnâthave quite enough rain to wipe away, so he turned them offagain. Rain quickly speckled the windscreen.
He turned on the wipers again, but they still refused to feelthat the exercise was worthwhile, and scraped and squeaked inprotest. The streets turned treacherously slippery.
Dirk shook his head. He was being quite absurd, he toldhimself, in the worst possible way. He had allowed himself tobecome fanciful in a manner that he quite despised. Heastounded himself at the wild fantasies he had built on theflimsiest amount of, well he would hardly call it evidence, mereconjecture.
An accident at an airport. Probably a simple explanation.
A man with a hammer. So what?
A grey van which Kate Schechter had seen at the hospital.Nothing unusual about that. Dirk had nearly
collided with it, butagain, that was a perfectly commonplace occurrence.
A Coca-Cola machine: he hadnât taken that into account.
Where did a Coca-Cola machine fit into these wild notionsabout ancient gods? The only idea he had about
that was simplytoo ridiculous for words and he refused even to acknowledge itto himself.
At that point Dirk found himself driving past the housewhere, that very moming, he had encountered a client of hiswho had had his severed head placed on a revolving recordturntable by a green-eyed devil-figure
waving a scythe and ablood-signed contract who had then vanished into thin air.
He peered at it as he passed, and when a large dark-blueBMW pulled out from the kerb just ahead of him
he ran straightinto the back of it, and for the second time that day he had toleap out of his car, already shouting. âFor Godâs sake canât you look where youâre going?â heexclaimed, in the hope of bagging his adversaryâs best linesfrom the outset. âStupid people!â he continued, without pausingfor breath. âCareering all over the place. Driving without duecare and attention! Reckless assault!â Confuse your enemy, hethought. lt was a little like phoning somebody up, and sayingâYes? Hello?â in a testy voice when they answered, which wasone of Dirkâs favourite methods of whiling away long, hotsummer afternoons. He bent down and examined the palpabledent in the rear of the BMW, which was quite obviously, damnit, a brand new one. Blast and bugger it,
thought Dirk.
âLook what youâve done to my bumper!â he cried. âI hopeyou have a good lawyer!â
âI am a good lawyer,â said a quiet voice which was followedby a quiet click. Dirk looked up in
momentary apprehension.The quiet click was only the sound of the car door closing.
The man was wearing an Italian suit, which was also quiet.He had quiet glasses, quietly cut hair, and
though a bow-tie isnot, by its very nature, a quiet object, the particular bow-tie hewore was, nevertheless, a very quietly spotted example of thegenre. He drew a slim wallet from his pocket and also a slimsilver pencil. He walked without fuss to the rear of Dirkâs Jaguarand made a note of the registration number.
âDo you have a card?â he enquired as he did so, withoutlooking up. âHereâs mine,â he added, taking one from his wallet.He made a note on the back of it. âMy registration number,â hesaid, âand the name of my insurance company. Perhaps youwould be good enough to let me have the name of yours. If youdonât have it with you, Iâll got my girl to call you.â
Dirk sighed, and decided there was no point in putting up afight on this one. He fished out his wallet and leafed through thevarious business cards that seemed to accumulate in it as if fromnowhere. He toyed for a second with the idea of being WesleyArlott, an ocean-going yacht navigation consultant from,apparently, Arkansas, but then thought better of it. The man had,after all, taken his registration number, and although Dirk had noparticular recollection of paying an insurance premium of late,he also had no particular recollection of not paying one either,which was a reasonably promising sign. He handed over a bona-fide card with a wince. The man looked at it.
âMr Gently,â he said. âPrivate investigator. Iâm sony, privateholistic investigator. OK.â
He put the card away, taking no further interest.
Dirk had never felt so patronised in his life. At that momentthere was another quiet click from the other
side of the car. Dirklooked across to see a woman with red spectacles standing theregiving him a frozen half smile. She was the woman he hadspoken with over Geoffrey Ansteyâs garden wall this morning,and the man,

Dirk therefore supposed, was probably herhusband. He wondered for a second whether he should wrestlethem to the ground and question them rigorously and violently,but he was suddenly feeling immensely tired and run down.
He acknowledged the woman in red spectacles with a minuteinclination of his head.
âAll done, Cynthia,â said the man and flicked a smile on andoff at her. âItâs all taken care of.â
She nodded faintly, and the two of them climbed back intotheir BMW and after a moment or two pulled
away without fussand disappeared away down the road. Dirk looked at the card inhis hand. Clive Draycott. He was with a good firm of Citysolicitors. Dirk stuck the card away in his wallet, climbeddespondently back into his car, and drove on back to his house,where he found a large golden eagle sitting patiently on hisdoorstep.

Chapter 20
Kate rounded on her guest as soon as they were both inside herflat with the door closed and Kate could be reasonably certainthat Neil wasnât going to sneak back out of his flat and lurk dis-approvingly half way up the stairs. The continuing thumping ofhis bass was at least her guarantee of privacy.
âAll right,â she said fiercely, âso what is the deal with theeagle then? What is the deal with all the street lights? Huh?â
The Norse God of Thunder looked at her awkwardly. He hadto remove his great horned helmet because it was bangingagainst the ceiling and leaving scratch marks in the plaster. Hetucked it under his arm.
âWhat is the deal,â continued Kate, âwith the Coca-Colamachine? What is the deal with the hammer? What, in short, isthe big deal? Huh?â
Thor said nothing. He frowned for a second in arrogantirritation, then frowned in something that looked somewhat likeembarrassment, and then simply stood there and bled at her.
For a few seconds she resisted the impending internalcollapse of her attitude, and then realised it was just going to goto hell anyway so she might as well go with it.
âOK,â she muttered, âletâs get all that cleaned up. Iâll findsome antiseptic.â
She went to rummage in the kitchen cupboard and returnedwith a bottle to find Thor saying âNoâ at her. âNo what?â she said crossly, putting the bottle down on thetable with a bit of a bang.
âThat,â said Thor, and pushed the bottle back at her. âNo.â
âWhatâs the matter with it?â
Thor just shrugged and stared moodily at a corner of theroom. There was nothing that could be considered
remotelyinteresting in that comer of the room, so he was clearly lookingat it out of sheer bloody-mindedness. âLook, buster,â said Kate, âif I can call you buster, what - â
âThor,â said Thor, âGod of - â
âYes,â said Kate, âyouâve told me all the things youâre Godof. Iâm trying to clean up your arm.â âSedra,â said Thor, holding his bleeding arm out, but awayfrom her. He peered at it anxiously.
âWhat?â
âCrushed leaves of sedra. Oil of the kernel of the apricot.Infusion of bitter orange blossom. Oil of almonds. Sage andcomfrey. Not this.â
He pushed the bottle of antiseptic off the table and sank into amood.
âRight!â said Kate, picked up the bottle and hurled it at him.It rebounded off his cheekbone leaving an instant red mark.Thor lunged forward in a rage, but Kate simply stood her groundwith a finger pointed at him.
âYou stay right there, buster!â she said, and he stopped.âAnything special you need for that?â Thor looked puzzled for a moment.
âThat!â said Kate, pointing at the blossoming bruise on hischeek.
âVengeance,â said Thor.
âIâll have to see what I can do,â said Kate. She turned on herheel and stalked out of the room.
Aher about two minutes of unseen activity Kate returned tothe room, trailed by wisps of steam.
âAll right,â she said, âcome with me.â
She led him into her bathroom. He followed her with a greatshow of reluctance, but he followed her. Kate
had been trailedby wisps of steam because the bathroom was full of it. The bathitself was overflowing with bubbles and gunk.
There were some bottles and pots, mostly empty, lined upalong a small shelf above the bath. Kate picked them up one byone and displayed them at him.
âApricot kernel oil,â she said, and turned it upside down toemphasise its emptiness. âAll in there,â she added, pointing atthe foaming bath.
âNeroli oil,â she said, picking up the next one, âdistilled fromthe blossom of bitter oranges. All in there.â She picked up the next one. âOrange cream bath oil. Containsalmond oil. All in there.â
She picked up the pots.
âSage and comfrey,â she said of one, âand sedra oil. One ofthemâs a hand cream and the otherâs hair
conditioner, but theyâreall in there, along with a tube of Aloe Lip Preserver, someCucumber Cleansing Milk, Honeyed Beeswax and Jojoba OilCleanser, Rhassoul Mud, Seaweed and Birch Shampoo, RichNight Cream with Vitamin E, and a very great deal of cod liveroil. Iâm afraid I havenât got anything called `Vengeanceâ, buthereâs some Calvin Klein `Obsessionâ.â
She took the stopper from a bottle of perfume and threw thebottle in the bath:

âIâll be in the next room when youâre done.âÂ·
With that she marched out, and slammed the door on him.She waited in the other room, firmly reading a book.

Dirk Gently 2 - The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul

Chapter 21
For about a minute Dirk remained sitting motionless in his car afew yards away from his front door. He wondered what his nextmove should be. A small, cautious one, he rather thought. Thelast thing he wanted to have to contend with at the moment wasa startled eagle.
He watched it intently. It stood there with a pert magnificenceabout its bearing, its talons gripped tightly round the edge of thestone step. From time to time it preened itself, and then peeredsharply up the street and down the street, dragging one of itsgreat talons across the stone in a deeply worrying manner. Dirkadmired the creature greatly for its size and its plumage and itsgeneral sense of extreme air-worthiness, but, asking himself ifhe liked the way that the light from the street lamp glinted in itsgreat glassy eye or on the huge hook of its beak, he had to admitthat he did not.
The beak was a major piece of armoury.
It was a beak that would frighten any animal on earth, evenone that was already dead and in a tin. Its talons looked as ifthey could rip up a small Volvo. And it was sitting waiting onDirkâs doorstep, looking up and down the street with a gaze thatwas at once meaningful and mean.
Dirk wondered if he should simply drive off and leave thecountry. Did he have his passport? No. It was at home. It wasbehind the door which was behind the eagle, in a drawersomewhere or, more likely, lost.
He could sell up. The ratio of estate agents to actual houses inthe area was rapidly approaching parity. One of their lot couldcome and deal with the house. Heâd had enough of it, with itsfridges and its wildlife and its ineradicable position on themailing lists of the American Express company.
Or he could, he supposed with a slight shiver, just go and seewhat it was the eagle wanted. There was a thought. Rats,probably, or a small whippet. All Dirk had, to his knowledge,was some Rice Krispies and an old muffin, and he didnât seethose appealing to this magisterial creature of the air. He ratherfancied that he could make out fresh blood congealing on thebirdâs talons, but he told himself firmly not to be so ridiculous.
He was just going to have to go and face up to the thing,explain that he was fresh out of rats and take the consequences.
Quietly, infinitely quietly, he pushed open the door of his car,and stole out of it, keeping his head down. He peered at it fromover the bonnet of the car. It hadnât moved. That is to say, ithadnât left the district. It was still looking this way and thataround itself with, possibly, a heightened sense of alertness.Dirk didnât know in what remote mountain eyrie the creaturehad learnt to listen out for the sound of Jaguar car door hingesrevolving in their sockets, but the sound had clearly not escapedits attention.
Cautiously, Dirk bobbed along behind the line of cars thathad prevented him from being able to park directly outside hisown house. In a couple of seconds all that separated him fromthe extraordinary creature was a small, blue Renault.
What next?
He could simply stand up and, as it were, declare himself. Hewould be saying, in effect, âHere I am, do what you will.â What-ever then transpired, the Renault could probably bear the brunt.
There was always the possibility, of course, that the eaglewould be pleased to see him, that all this swooping it had beendirecting at him had been just its way of being matey.Assuming, of course, that it was the same eagle. That was notsuch an enormous assumption. The number of golden eagles atlarge in North London at any one time was, Dirk guessed, fairlysmall.
Or maybe it was just nesting on his doorstep completely bychance, enjoying a quick breather prior to having another hurtlethrough the sky in pursuit of whatever it is that eagles hurtlethrough the sky after.
Whatever the explanation, now, Dirk realised, was the timethat he had simply to take his chances. He steeled himself, tooka deep breath and arose from behind the Renault, like a spiritrising from the deep.
The eagle was looking in another direction at the time, and itwas a second or so before it looked back to the front and sawhim, at which point it reacted with a loud screech and steppedback an inch or two, a reaction which Dirk felt a little put out by.It then blinked rapidly a few times and adopted a sort of perkyexpression of which Dirk did not have the faintest idea what tomake.
He waited for a second or two, until he felt the situation hadsettled down again after all the foregoing excitement, and thenstopped forward tentatively, round the front of the Renault. Anumber of quiet, interrogative cawing noises seemed to floatuncertainly through the air, and then after a moment Dirkrealised that he was making them himself and made himselfstop. This was an eagle he was dealing with, not a budgie.
It was at this point that he made his mistake.
With his mind entirely taken up with eagles, the possibleintentions of eagles, and the many ways in which

eagles mightbe considercd to differ from small kittens, he did not concentrateenough on what he was doing as he stepped up out of the roadand on to a pavement that was slick with the recent drizzle. Ashe brought his rear foot forward it caught on the bumper of thecar he wobbled, slipped, and then did that thing which oneshould never do to a large eagle of uncertain temper, which wasto fling himself headlong at it with his arms outstretched.
The eagle reacted instantly.
Without a secondâs hesitation it hopped neatly aside andallowed Dirk the space he needed to collapse heavily on to hisown doorstep. It then peered down at him with a scorn thatwould have withered a lesser man, or at least a man that hadbeen looking up at that moment.
Dirk groaned.
He had sustained a blow to the temple from the edge of thestep, and it was a blow, he felt, that he could just as easily havedone without this evening. He lay there gasping for a second ortwo, then at last rolled over heavily, clasping one hand to hisforehead, the other to his nose, and looked up at the great bird inapprehension, reflecting bitterly on the conditions under whichhe was expected to work.
When it became clear to him that he appeared for the momentto have nothing to fear from the eagle, who was merelyregarding him with a kind of quizzical, blinking doubt, he sat up,and then slowly dragged himself back to his feet and wiped andsmaacked some of the dirt off his coat. Then he hunted throughhis pockets for his keys and unlocked the front door, whichseemed a little loose. He waited to see what the eagle would donext.
With a slight rustle of its wings it hopped over the lintel andinto his hall. It looked around itself, and seemed to regard whatit saw with a little distaste. Dirk didnât know what it was thateagles expected of peopleâs hallways, but had to admit tohimself that it wasnât only the eagle which reacted like that. Thedisorder was not that great, but there was a grimness to it whichtended to cast a pall over visitors, and the eagle was clearly notimmune to this effect.
Dirk picked up a large flat envelope lying on his doormat,looked inside it to check that it was what he had been expecting,then noticed that a picture was missing from the wall. It wasnât aparticularly wonderful picture, merely a small Japanese printthat he had found in Camden Passage and quite liked, but thepoint was that it was missing. The hook on the wall was empty.There was a chair missing as well, he realised.
The possible significance of this suddenly struck him, and hehurried through to the kitchen. Many of his assorted kitchenimplements had clearly gone. The rack of largely unusedSabatier knives, the food processor and his radio cassette playerhad all vanished, but he did, however, have a new fridge. It hadobviously been delivered by Nobby Paxtonâs felonious thugsand he would just have to make the usual little list.
Still, he had a new fridge and that was a considerable load offhis mind. Already the whole atmosphere in the kitchen seemedeasier. The tension had lifted. There was a new sense oflightness and springiness in the air which had evencommunicated itself to the pile of old pizza boxes which seemednow to recline at a jaunty rather than an oppressive angle.
Dirk cheerfully threw open the door to the new fridge andwas delighted to find it completely and utterly empty. Its innerlight shone on perfectly clean blue and white walls and ongleaming chrome shelves. He liked it so much that he instantlydetermined to keep it like that. He would put nothing in it at all.His food would just have to go off in plain view.
Good. He closed it again.
A screech and a flap behind him reminded him that he wasentertaining a visiting eagle. He turned to find it glaring at himfrom on top of the kitchen table.
Now that he was getting a little more accustomed to it, andhad not actually been viciously attacked as he had suspected hemight be, it seemed a little less fearsome than it had at first. Itwas still a serious amount of eagle, but perhaps an eagle was aslightly more manageable proposition than he had originallysupposed. He relaxed a little and took off his hat, pulled off hiscoat, and threw them on to a chair.
The eagle seemed at this juncture to sense that Dirk might begetting the wrong idea about it and flexed one of its claws athim. With sudden alarm Dirk saw that it did indeed havesomething that closely resembled congealed blood on the talons.He backed away from it hurriedly. The eagle then rose up to itsfull height on its talons and began to spread its great wings out,wider and wider, beating them very slowly and leaning forwardso as to keep its balance. Dirk did the only thing he could thinkto do under the cincumstances and bolted from the room,slamming the door behind him and jamming the hall table upagainst it.
A terrible cacophony of screeching and scratching andbuffeting arose instantly from behind it. Dirk sat leaning backagainst the table, panting and trying to catch his breath, and thenafter a while began to get a worrying feeling about what the birdwas up to now.
It seemed to him that the eagle was actually dive-bombingitself against the door. Every few seconds the

pattern wouldrepeat itself - first a great beating of wings, then a rush, then aterrible cracking thud. Dirk didnât think it would get through thedoor, but was alarmed that it might beat itself to death trying.The creature seemed to be quite frantic about something, butwhat, Dirk could not even begin to imagine. He tried to calmhimself down and think clearly, to work out what he should donext.
He should phone Kate and make certain she was all right.
Whoosh, thud!
He should finally open up the envelope he had been carryingwith him all day and examine its contents. Whoosh, thud!
For that he would need a sharp knife.
Whoosh, thud!
Three rather awkward thoughts then struck him in fairlyquick succession.
Whoosh, thud!
First, the only sharp knives in the place, assuming Nobbyâsremoval people had left him with any at all,
were in the kitchen. Whoosh, thud!
That didnât matter so much in itself, because he couldprobably find something in the house that would do. Whoosh, thud!
The second thought was that the actual envelope itself was inthe pocket of his coat which he had left lying
over the back of achair in the kitchen. Whoosh, thud!
The third thought was very similar to the second and had todo with the location of the piece of paper with Kateâs telephonenumber on it.
Whoosh, thud!
Oh God.
Whoosh, thud!
Dirk began to feel very, very tired at the way the day wasworking out. He was deeply worried by the sense
of impendingcalamity, but was still by no means able to divine what lay at theroot of it. Whoosh, thud!
Well, he knew what he had to do now...
Whoosh, thud!
... so there was no point in not getting on with it. He quietlypulled the table away from the door.
Whoosh -
He ducked and yanked the door open, passing smoothlyunder the eagle as it hurtled out into the hallway
and hit theopposite wall. He slammed the door closed behind him frominside the kitchen, pulled his coat off the chair and jammed thechair back up under the handle.
Whoosh, thud!
The damage done to the door on this side was bothconsiderable and impressive, and Dirk began seriously to worryabout what this behaviour said about the birdâs state of mind, orwhat the birdâs state of mind might become if it maintained thisbehaviour for very much longer.
Whoosh... scratch...
The same thought seemed to have occurred to the bird at thatmoment, and after a brief flurry of screeching and of scratchingat the door with its talons it lapsed into a grumpy and defeatedsilence, which after it had been going on for about a minutebecame almost as disturbing as the previous batterings.
Dirk wondered what it was up to.
He approached the door cautiously and very, very quietlymoved the chair back a little so that he could see through thekeyhole. He squatted down and peered through it. At first itseemed to him that he could see nothing through it, that it mustbe blocked by something. Then, a slight flicker and glint closeup on the other side suddenly revealed the startling truth, whichwas that the eagle also had an eye up at the keyhole and wasbusy looking back at him. Dirk almost toppled backwards withthe shock of the realisation, and backed away from the door witha sense of slight horror and revulsion.
This was extremely intelligent behaviour for an eagle wasnâtit? Was it? How could he find out? He couldnât think of any or-nithological experts to phone. All his reference books were piledup in other rooms of the house, and he didnât think heâd be ableto keep on pulling off the same stunt with impunity, certainlynot when he was dealing with an eagle which had managed tofigure out what keyholes were for.
He retrealed to the kitchen sink and found some kitchentowel. He folded it into a wad, soaked it, and dabbed it first onhis bleeding temple, which was swelling up nicely, and then onhis nose which was still very

tender, and had been aconsiderable size for most of the day now. Maybe the eagle wasan eagle of delicate sensibilities and had reacted badly to thesight of Dirkâs face in its current, much abused, state and hadsimply lost its mind. Dirk sighed and sat down.
Kateâs telephone, which was the next thing he turned hisattention to, was answered by a machine when he tried to ring it.Her voice told him, very sweetly, that he was welcome to leavea message after the beep, but warned that she hardly everlistened to them and that it was much better to talk to herdirectly, only he couldnât because she wasnât in, so heâd best tryagain.
Thank you very much, he thought, and put the phone down.
He realised that the truth of the matter was this: he had spentthe day putting off opening the envelope because of what he wasworried about finding in it. It wasnât that the idea wasfrightening, though indeed it was frightening that a man shouldsell his soul to a green-eyed man with a scythe, which is whatcircumstances were trying very hard to suggest had happened. Itwas just that it was extremely depressing that he should sell it toa green-eyed man with a scythe in exchange for a share in theroyalties of a hit record.
That was what it looked like on the face of it. Wasnât it?
Dirk picked up the other envelope, the one which had beenwaiting for him on his doormat, delivered there by courier froma large London bookshop where Dirk had an account. He pulledout the contents, which were a copy of the sheet music of HotPototo, written by Colin Paignton, Phil Mulville and GeoffAnstey.
The lyrics were, well, straightforward. They provided a basicrepetitive bit of funk rhythm and a simple sense of menace andcheerful callousness which had caught the mood of last summer.They went:
Hot Potato,
Donât pick it up, pick it up, pick it up.
Quick, pass it on, poss it on, poss it on.
You donât want to get caught, get caught, get caught.
Drop it on someone. Who ? Who ? Anybody.
You better not have it when the big one comes.
I said you better not have it when the big one comes.
Itâs a Hot Potato.
And so on. The repeated phrases got tossed back and forwardbetween the two members of the band, the
drum machine gotheavier and heavier, and there had been a dance video.
Was that all it was going to be? Big deal. A nice house inLupton Street with polyurethaned floors and a
broken marriage?
Things had certainly come down a long way since the greatdays of Faust and Mephistopheles, when a man
could gain allthe knowledge of the universe, achieve all the ambitions of hismind and all the pleasures of the flesh for the price of his soul.Now it was a few record royalties, a few pieces of trendyfurniture, a trinket to stick on your bathroom wall and, whap,your head comes off.
So what exactly was the deal? What was the Potato contract?Who was getting what and why?
Dirk rummaged through a drawer for the breadknife, satdown once more, took the envelope from his coat pocket andripped through the congealed strata of Sellotape which held theend of it together.
Out fell a thick bundle of papers.

Dirk Gently 2 - The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul

Chapter 22
At exactly the moment that the telephone rang, the door toKateâs sitting-room opened. The Thunder God attempted tostomp in through it, but in fact he wafted. He had clearly soakedhimself very thoroughly in the stuff Kate had thrown into thebath, then redressed, and torn op a nightgown of Kateâs to bindhis forearm with. He casually tossed a handful of softened oakshards away into the comer of the room. Kate decided for themoment to ignore both the deliberate provocations and thetelephone. The former she could deal with and the latter she hada machine for dealing with.
âIâve been reading about you,â she challenged the ThunderGod. âWhereâs your beard?â
He took the book, a one volume encyclopaedia, from herhands and glanced at it before tossing it aside contemptuously.
âHa,â he said, âI shaved it off. When I was in Wales.â Hescowled at the memory.
âWhat were you doing in Wales for heavenâs sake?â
âCounting the stones,â he said with a shrug, and went to stareout of the window.
There was a huge, moping anxiety in his bearing. It suddenlyoccurred to Kate with a spasm of something
not entinely unlikefear, that sometimes when people got like that, it was becausethey had picked up their mood from the weather. With aThunder God it presumably worked the other way round. Thesky ootside certainly had a restless and disgruntled look.
Her reactions suddenly started to become very confused.
âExcuse me if this sounds like a stupid question,â said Kate,âbut Iâm a little at sea here. Iâm not used to spending the eveningwith someone whoâs got a whole day named after them. Whatstones were you counting in Wales?â
âAll of them,â said Thor in a low growl. âAll of thembetween this size... â he held the tip of his forefinger and thumbabout a quarter of an inch apart, â...and this size.â He held histwo hands about a yard apart, and then put them down again.
Kate stared at him blankly.
âWell... how many were thene?â she asked. It seemed onlypolite to ask.
He rounded on her angrily.
âCount them yourself if you want to know!â he shouted.âWhatâs the point in my spending years and years
and yearscounting them, so that Iâm the only person who knows, and whowill ever know, if I just go and tell somebody else? Well?â
He turned back to the window.
âAnyway,â he said, âIâve been worried about it. I think I mayhave lost count somewhere in Mid- Glamorgan. But Iâm not,â heshouted, âgoing to do it again!â
âWell, why on earth would you do such an extraordinarything in the first place?â
âIt was a burden placed on me by my father. A punishment.A penance.â He glowered.
âYour father?â said Kate. âDo you mean Odin?â
âThe All-Father,â said Thor. âFather of the Gods of Asgard.â
âAnd youâre saying heâs alive?â
Thor turned to look at her as if she was stupid.
âWe are immortals,â he said, simply.
Downstairs, Neil chose that moment to conclude histhunderous performance on the bass, and the house
seemed tosing in its aftermath with an eerie silence.
âImmortals are what you wanted,â said Thor in a low, quietvoice. âImmortals are what you got. It is a little
hard on us. Youwanted us to be for ever, so we are for ever. Then you forgetabout us. But still we are for ever. Now at last, many are dead,many dying,â he then added in a quiet voice, âbut it takes aspecial effort.â
âI canât even begin to understand what youâre talking about,âsaid Kate, âyou say that I, we - â
âYou can begin to understand,â said Thor, angrily, âwhich iswhy I have come to you. Do you know that most people hardlysee me? Hardly notice me at all? It is not that we are hidden. Weare here. We move among you. My people. Your gods. Yougave birth to us. You made us be whatâyou would not dare to beyourselves. Yet you will not acknowledge us. If I walk alongone of your streets in this... world you have made for yourselveswithout us, then barely an eye will once flicker in my direction.â
âIs this when youâre wearing the helmet?â âEspecially when Iâm wearing the helmet!â âWell- â

âYou make fun of me!â roared Thor.
âYou make it very easy for a girl,â said Kate. âI donât knowwhat - â
Suddenly the room seemed to quake and then to catch itsbreath. All of Kateâs insides wobbled violently
and then heldvery still. In the sudden horrible silence, a blue china table lampslowly toppled off the table, hit the floor, and crawled off to adark corner of the room where it sat in a worried little defensivehuddle.
Kate stared at it and tried to be calm about it. She felt as ifcold, soft jelly was trickling down her skin. âDid you do that?â she said shakily.
Thor was looking livid and confused. He muttered, âDo notmake me angry with you. You were very
lucky.â He lookedaway.
âWhat are you saying?â
âIâm saying that I wish you to come with me.â
âWhat? What about that?â She pointed at the smallbefuddled kitten under the table which had so recently
and soconfusingly been a blue china table lamp.
âThereâs nothing I can do for it.â
Kate was suddenly so tired and confused and frightened thatshe found she was nearly in tears. She stood
biting her lip andtrying to be as angry as she could.
âOh yeah?â she said. âI thought you were meant to be a god. Ihope you havenât got into my home under
false pretences, I...âShe stumbled to a halt, and then resumed in a different tone ofvoice.
âDo you mean,â she said, in a small voice, âthat you havebeen here, in the world, all this time?â
âHere, and in Asgard,â said Thor.
âAsgard,â said Kate. âThe home of the gods?â
Thor was silent. It was a grim silence that seemed to be fullof something that bothered him deeply. âWhere is Asgard?â demanded Kate.
Again Thor did not speak. He was a man of very few wordsand enormously long pauses. When at last he
did answer, itwasnât at all clear whether he had been thinking all that time orjust standing there.
âAsgard is also here,â he said. âAll worlds are here.â
He drew out from under his furs his great hammer andstudied its head deeply and with an odd curiosity, as
ifsomething about it was very puzzling. Kate wondered where shefound such a gesture familiar from. She found that itinstinctively made her want to duck. She stepped back veryslightly and was watchful.
When he looked up again, there was an altogether new focusand energy in his eyes, as if he was gathering himself up to hurlhimself at something. â
âTonight I must be in Asgard,â he said. âI must confront myfather Odin in the great hall of Valhalla and bring him toaccount for what he has done.â
âYou mean, for making you count Welsh pebbles?â
âNo!â said Thor. âFor making the Welsh pebbles not worthcounting!â
Kate shook her head in exasperation. âI simply donât knowwhat to make of you at all,â she said. âI think
Iâm just too tired.Come back tomorrow. Explain it all in the morning.â
âNo,â said Thor. âYou must see Asgard yourself, and thenyou will understand. You must see it tonight.â
He gripped her bythe arm.
âI donât want to go to Asgard,â she insisted. âI donât go tomythical places with strange men. You go. Call
me up and tellme how it went in the morning. Give him hell about thepebbles.â
She wrested her arm from his grip. It was very, very clear toher that she only did this with his permission. âNow please, go, and let me sleep!â She glared at him.
At that moment the house seemed to erupt as Neil launchedinto a thumping bass rendition of Siegfriedâs
Rheinfahrt fromAct 1 of Gâtterdâmmerung, just to prove it could be done. Thewalls shook, the windows rattled. From under the table thesound of the table lamp mewing pathetically could just be heard.
Kate tried to maintain her furious glare, but it simply couldnâtbe kept up for very long in the circumstances.
âOK,â she said at last, âhow do we get to this place?â
âThere are as many ways as there are tiny pieces.â
âI beg your pardon?â
âTiny things.â He held up his thumb and forefinger again toindicate something very small. âMolecules,â
he added, seemingto be uncomfortable with the word. âBut first let us leave here.â âWill I need a coat in Asgard?â
âAs you wish.â
âWell, Iâll take one anyway. Wait a minute.â

She decided that the best way to deal with the astonishingrigmarole which currently constituted her life was to bebusinesslike about it. She found her coat, brushed her hair, left anew message on her telephone answering machine and put asaucer of milk firmly under the table.
âRight,â she said, and led the way out of the flat, locking itcarefully after them, and making shushing noises as they passedNeilâs door. For all the uproar he was currently making he wasalmost certainly listening out for the slightest sound, and wouldbe out in a moment if he heard them going by to complain aboutthe Coca- Cola machine, the lateness of the hour, manâsinhumanity to man, the weather, the noise, and the colour ofKateâs coat, which was a shade of blue that Neil for some reasondisapproved of most particularly. They stole past successfullyand closed the front door behind them with the merest click.

Dirk Gently 2 - The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul

Chapter 23
The sheets which tumbled out on to Dirkâs kitchen table weremade of thick heavy paper, folded together, and had obviouslybeen much handled.
He sorted them out, one by one, separating them from eachother, smoothing them out with the flat of his hand and layingthem out neatly in rows on the kitchen table, clearing a space, asit became necessary, among the old newspapers, ashtrays anddirty cereal bowls which Elena the cleaner always left exactlywhere they were, claiming, when challenged on this, that shethought he had put them there specially.
He pored over the papers for several minutes, moving fromone to another, comparing them with each other, studying themcarefully, page by page, paragraph by paragraph, line by line.
He couldnât understand a word of them.
It should have occurred to him, he realised, that the green-eyed, hairy, scythe-waving giant might differ from him not onlyin general appearance and personal habits, but also in suchmatters as the alphabet he favoured.
He sat back in his seat, disgruntled and thwarted, and reachedfor a cigarette, but the packet in his coat was now empty. Hepicked up a pencil and tapped it in a cigarette-like way, but itwasnât able to produce the same effect.
After a minute or two he became acutely conscious of the factthat he was probably still being watched through the keyhole bythe eagle and he found that this made it impossibly hard toconcentrate on the problem before him, particularly without acigarette. He scowled to himself. He knew there was still apacket upstairs by his bed, but he didnât think he could handlethe sheer ornithology involved in going to get it.
He tried to stare at the papers for a little longer. The writing,apart from being written in some kind of small, crabby andindecipherable runic script, was mostly hunched up towards theleft-hand side of the paper as if swept there by a tide. The right-hand side was largely clear except for an occasionai group ofcharacters which were lined up underneath each other. All of it,except for a slight sense of undefinable familiarity about thelayout, was completely meaningless to Dirk.
He turned his attention back to the envelope instead and triedonce more to examine some of the names which had been soheavily crossed out.
Howard Bell, the incredibly wealthy bestselling novelist whowrote bad books which sold by the warehouse-load despite - orperhaps because of - the fact that nobody read them.
Dennis Hutch, record company magnate. Now that he had acontext for the name, Dirk knew it perfeetly well. The AriesRising Record Group which had been founded on Sixties ideals,or at least on what passed for ideals in the Sixties, grown in theSeventies and then embraced the materialism of the Eightieswithout missing a beat, was now a massive entertainmentconglomerate on both sides of the Atlantic. Dennis Hutch hadstepped up into the top seat when its founder had died of a lethaloverdose of brick wall, taken while under the influence of aFerrari and a bottle of tequila. ARRGH! was also the recordlabel on which Hot Potato had been released.
Stan Dubcek, senior partner in the advertising company withthe silly name which now owned most of the British andAmerican advertising companies which had not had nameswhich were quite as silly, and had therefore been swallowedwhole.
And here, suddenly, was another name that was instantlyrecognisable, now that Dirk was attuned to the sort of names heshould be looking for. Roderick Mercer, the worldâs greatestpublisher of the worldâs sleaziest newspapers. Dirk hadnât atfirst spotted the name with the unfamiliar â...erickâ in placeafter the âRodâ. Well, well, well. . .
Now here were people, thought Dirk suddenly, who hadreally got something. Certainly they had got rather more than anice little house in Lupton Road with some dried flowers lyingaround the place. They also had the great advantage of havingheads on their shoulders as well, unless Dirk had missedsomething new and dramatic on the news. What did that allmean? What was this contract? How come everybody whosehands it had been through had been so astoundingly successfulexcept for one, Geoffrey Anstey? Everybody whose hands it hadpassed through had benefited from it except for the one who hadit last. Who had still got it.
It was a hot potato. .
You better not have it when the big one comes.
The notion suddenly formed in Dirkâs mind that it might havebeen Geoffrey Anstey himself who had
overheard aconversation about a hot potato, about getting rid of it, passing iton. If he remembered correctly the interview he had read withPain, he didnât say that he himself had overheard theconversation.
You better not have it when the big one comes.

The notion was a horrible one and ran on like this: GeoffreyAnstey had been pathetically nave. He had overheard thisconversation, between - who? Dirk picked up the envelope andran over the list of names - and had thought that it had a gooddance rhythm. He had not for a moment realised that what hewas listening to was a conversation that would result in his ownhideous death. He had got a hit record out of it, and when thereal hot potato was actually handed to him he had picked it up.
Donât pick it up, pick it up, pick it up.
And instead of taking the advice he had recorded in thc wordsof the song...
Quick, pass it on, pass it on, pass it on.
... he had stuck it behind the gold record award on hisbathroom wall.
You better not have it when the big one comes.
Dirk frowned and took a long, slow thoughtful drag on hispencil.
This was ridiculous.
He had to got some cigarettes if he was going to think thisthrough with any intellectual rigour. He pulled
on his coat,stuffed his hat on his head and made for the window.
The window hadnât been opened for - well, certainly notduring his ownership of the house, and it
struggled andscreamed at the sudden unaccustomed invasion of its space andindependence. Once he had forced it wide enough, Dirkstruggled out on to the windowsill, pulling swathes of leathercoat out with him. From here it was a bit of a jump to thepavement since there was a lower ground floor to the house witha narrow flight of steps leading down to it in the front. A line ofiron railings separated these from the pavement, and Dirk had toget clear over these.
Without hesitating for a moment he made the jump, and itwas in mid-bound that he realised he had not pickcd up his carkeys from the kitchen table where heâd left them.
He considered as he sailed gracelessly through the airwhether or not to execute a wild mid-air twist, make a desperategrab backwards for the window and hope that he might justmanage to hold on to the sill, but decided on mature reflectionthat an error at this point might just conceivably kill himwhereas the walk would probably do him good.
He landed heavily on the far side of the railings, but the tailsof his coat became entangled with them and he had to pull themoff, tearing part of the lining in the process. Once the ringingshock in his knees had subsided and he had recovered what littlecomposure the events of the day had left him with, he realisedthat it was now well after eleven oâclock and the pubs would beshut, and he might have a longer walk than he had bargained forto find some cigarettes.
He considered what to do.
The current outlook and state of mind of tbe eagle was amajor factor to be taken into account here. The only way to gethis car keys now was back through the front door into his eagle-infested hallway.
Moving with great caution he tip-toed back up the steps to hisfront door, squatted down and, hoping that the damn thingwasnât going to squeak, gently pushed up the flap of the letter-box and peered through.
In an instant a talon was hooked into the back of his hand anda great screeching beak slashed at his eye, narrowly missing itbut scratching a great gouge across his much abused nose.
Dirk howled with pain and lurched backwards, not gettingvery far because he still had a talon hooked in his hand. Helashed out desperately and hit at the talon, which hurt himconsiderably, dug the sharp point even further into his flesh andcaused a great, barging flurry on the far side of the door, eachtiniest movement of which tugged heavily in his hand.
He grabbed at the great claw with his free hand and and tried totug it back out of himself. It was immensely strong, and wasshaking with the fury of the eagle, which was as trapped as hewas. At last, quivering with pain, he managed to release himself,and pulled his injured hand back, nursing and cuddling it withthe other.
The eagle pulled its claw back sharply, and Dirk heard itflapping away back down his hallway, emitting terriblescreeches and cries, its great wings colliding with and scrapingthc walls.
Dirk toyed with the idea of burning the house down, but oncethe throbbing in his hand had begun to subside a little he calmeddown and tried, if he could, to see things from the eagleâs pointof view.
He couldnât.
He had not the faintest idea how things appeared to eagles ingeneral, much less to this particular eagle, which seemed to be aseriously deranged example of the species.
After a minute or so more of nursing his hand, curiosity-allied to a strong sense that the eagle had definitely retreated tothe far end of the hall and stayed there - overcame him, and hebent down once more to the letter-box. This time he used hispencil to push the flap back upwards and scanned the hallwayfrom a safe

position a good few inches back.
The eagle was clearly in view, perched on the end of thebannister rail, regarding him with resentment and
opprobrium,which Dirk felt was a little rich coming from a creature whichhad only a moment or two ago been busily engaged in trying torip his hand off.
Then, once the eagle was certain that it had got Dirkâsattention, it slowly raised itself up on its feet and slowly shookits great wings out, beating them gently for balance. It was thisgesture that had previously caused Dirk to bolt prudently fromthe room. This time, however, he was safely behind a couple ofgood solid inches of wood and he stood, or rather, squatted hisground. The eagle stretched its neck upwards as well, jabbing itstongue out at the air and cawing plaintively, which surprisedDirk.
Then he noticed something else rather surprising about theeagle, which was that its wings had strange, un- eaglelikemarkings on them. They were large concentric circles.
The differences of coloration which delineated thc circleswere very slight, and it was only the absolute geometricregularity of them which made them stand out as clearly as theydid. Dirk had the very clear sense that the eagle was showinghim these circles, and that that was what it had wanted to attracthis attention to all along. Each time the bird had dived at him, herealised as he thought back, it had then started on a strange kindof flapping routine which had involved opening its wings rightout. However, each time it had happened Dirk had been toobusily engaged with the business of turning round and runningaway to pay this exhibition the appropriate attention.
âHave you got the money for a cup of tea, mate?â
âEr, yes thank you,â said Dirk, âIâm fine.â His attention wasfully occupied with the eagle, and he didnât immediately lookround.
âNo, I meant can you spare me a bob or two, just for a cup oftea?â âWhat?â This time Dirk looked round, irritably.
âOr just a fag, mate. Got a fag you can spare?â
âNo, I was just going to go and get some myself,â said Dirk.
The man on the pavement behind him was a tramp ofindeterminate age. He was standing there, slightly wobbly, witha look of wild and continuous disappointment bobbing in hiseyes.
Not getting an immediate response from Dirk, the mandropped his eyes to the ground about a yard in front of him, andswayed back and forth a little. He was holding his arms out,slightly open, slightly away from his body, and just swaying.Then he frowned suddenly at the ground. Then he frowned atanother part of the ground. Then, holding himself steady whilehe made quite a major realignment of his head, he frowned awaydown the street.
âHave you lost something?â said Dirk.
The manâs head swayed back towards him.
âHave I lost something?â he said in querulous astonishment.âHave I lost something?â
It seemed to be the most astounding question he had everheard. He looked away again for a while, and
seemed to betrying to balance the question in the general scale of things. Thisinvolved a fair bit more swaying and a fair few more frowns. Atlast he seemed to come up with something that might do serviceas some kind of answer.
âThe sky?â he said, challenging Dirk to find this a goodenough answer. He looked up towards it, carefully, so as not tolose his balance. He seemed not to like what he saw in the dim,orange, street-lit pallor of the clouds, and slowly looked backdown again till he was staring at a point just in front of his feet.
âThe ground?â he said, with evident great dissatisfaction, andthen was struck with a sudden thought.
âFrogs?â he said, wobbling his gaze up to meet Dirkâs ratherbewildered one. âI used to like...frogs,â he said, and left hisgaze sitting on Dirk as if that was all he had to say, and the restwas entirely up to Dirk now.
Dirk was completely flummoxed. He longed for the timeswhen life had been easy, life had been carefree, the great timesheâd had with a mere homicidal eagle, which seemed now to besuch an easygoing and amiable companion. Aerial attack hecould cope with, but not this nameless roaring guilt that camehowling at him out of nowhere.
âWhat do you want?â he said in a strangled voice.
âJust a fag, mate,â said the tramp, âor something for a cup oftea.â
Dirk pressed a pound coin into the manâs hand and lunged offdown the street in a panic, passing, twenty
yards further on, abuilderâs skip from which the shape of his old fridge loomed athim menacingly.

Dirk Gently 2 - The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul

Chapter 24
As Kate came down the steps from her house she noticed thatthe temperature had dropped considerably. The clouds satheavily on the land and loured at it. Thor set off briskly in thedirection of the park, and Kate trotted along in his wake.
As he strode along, an extraordinary figure on the streets ofPrimrose Hill, Kate could not help but notice that he had beenright. They passed three different people on the way, and shesaw distinctly how their eyes avoided looking at him, even asthey had to make allowance for his great bulk as he passed them.He was not invisible, far from it. He simply didnât fit.
The park was closed for the night, but Thor leapt quickly overthe spiked railings and then lifted her over in turn as lightly as ifshe had been a bunch of flowers.
The grass was damp and mushy, but still worked its magic oncity feet. Kate did what she always did when entering the park,which was to bob down and put the flats of her hands down onthe ground for a moment. She had never quite worked out whyshe did this, and often she would adjust a shoe or pick up a pieceof litter as a pretext for the movement, but all she really wantedwas to feel the grass and the wet earth on her palms.
The park from this viewpoint was simply a dark shoulder thatrose up before them, obscuring itself. They mounted the hill andstood on the top of it, looking over the darkness of the rest of thepark to where it shaded off into the hazy light of the heart ofLondon which lay to the south. Ugly towers and blocks stuckyobbishly up out of the skyline, dominating the park, the sky,and the city.
A cold, damp wind moved across the park, flicking at it fromtime to time like the tail of a dark and broody horse. There wasan unsettled, edgy quality to it. In fact the night sky seemed toKate to be like a train of restless, irritable horses, their tracesflapping and slapping in the wind. It also seemed to her as if thetraces all radiated loosely from a single centre, and that thecentre was very close by her. She reprimanded herself for absurdsuggestibility, but nevertheless, it still seemed that all theweather was gathered and circling around them, waiting onthem.
Thor once more drew out his hammer, and held it before himin the thoughtful and abstracted manner she had seen a fewminutes before in her flat. He frowned, and seemed to bepicking tiny invisible pieces of dust off it. It was a little like achimpanzee grooming its mate, or - that was it! - thecomparison was extraordinary, but it explained why she hadtensed herself so watchfully when last he had done it. It was likeJimmy Connors minutely adjusting the strings of his racquetbefore preparing to serve.
He looked up sharply once again, drew his arm back, turnedfully once, twice, three times, twisting his heels heavily in themud, and then hurled his hammer with astonishing force up tothe heavens.
It vanished almost instantly into the murky haze of the sky.Damp flashes sparked deep within the clouds, tracking its pathin a long parabola through the night. At the furthest extent of theparabola it swung down out of the clouds, a distant tiny pinpointmoving slowly now, gathering and redirecting its momentum forthe return flight. Kate watched, breathless, as the speck creptbehind the dome of St Paulâs. It then seemed almost as if it hadhalted altogether, hanging silently and improbably in the air,before gradually beginning to increase microscopically in size asit accelerated back towards them.
Then, as it returned, it swung aside in its path, no longerdescribing a simple parabola, but following instead a new pathwhich seemed to lie along the perimeter of a gigantic Mobiusstrip which took it round the other side of the Telecom Tower.Then suddenly it was swinging back in a path directly towardsthem, hurtling out of the night with impossible weight and speedlike a piston in a shaft of light. Kate swayed and nearly droppedin a dead faint out of its path, when Thor stepped forward andcaught it with a grunt.
The jolt of it sent a single heavy shudder down into the earth,and then the thing was resting quietly in Thorâs grip. His armquivered slightly and was still.
Kate felt quite dizzy. She didnât know exactly what it wasthat had just happened, but she felt pretty damn certain that itwas the sort of experience that her mother would not haveapproved of on a first date.
âIs this all part of what we have to do to go to Asgard?â shesaid. âOr are you just fooling around?â
âWe will go to Asgard...now,â he said.
At that moment he raised his hand as if to pluck an apple, butinstead of plucking he made a tiny, sharp
turning movement.The effect was as if he had twisted the entire world through abillionth part of a billionth part of a degree. Everything shifted,was for a moment minutely out of focus, and then snapped backagain as a suddenly different world.
This world was a much darker one and colder still.
A bitter, putrid wind blew sharply, and made every breathgag in the throat. The ground beneath their feet

was no longerthe soft muddy grass of the hill, but a foul-smelling, oozingslush. Darkness lay over all the horizon with a few smallexceptional fires dotted here and there in the distance, and onegreat blaze of light about a mile and a half away to the south-east.
Here, great fantastical towers stabbed at the night; hugepinnacles and turrets flickered in the firelight that surged from athousand windows. It was an edifice that mocked reason,ridiculed reality and jeered wildly at the night.
âMy fatherâs palace,â said Thor, âthe Great Hall of Valhallawhere we must go.â
It was just on the tip of Kateâs tongue to say that somethingabout the place was oddly familiar when the sound of horsesâhooves pounding through the mud came to them on the wind. Ata distance, between where they stood and the Great Hall ofValhalla, a small number of flickering torches could be seenjolting towards them.
Thor once more studied the head of his hammer with interest,brushed it with his forefinger and rubbed it with his thumb. Thenslowly he looked up, again he twisted round once, then twiceand a third time and then hurled the missile into the sky. Thistime, however, he continued to hold on to its shaft with his righthand, while with his left he held Kateâs waist in his grasp.

Dirk Gently 2 - The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul

Chapter 25
Cigarettes clearly intended to make themselves a major problemfor Dirk tonight.
For most of the day, except for when heâd woken up, andexcept for again shortly after heâd woken up, and except forwhen he had just encountered the revolving head of GeoffreyAnstey, which was understandable, and also except for whenheâd been in the pub with Kate, he had had absolutely nocigarettes at all.
Not one. They were out of his life, foresworn utterly. Hedidnât need them. He could do without them. They merelynagged at him like mad and made his life a living hell, but hedecided he could handle that.
Now, however, just when he had suddenly decided, coolly,rationally, as a clear, straightforward decision rather than merelya feeble surrender to craving, that he would, after all, have acigarette, could he find one? He could not.
The pubs by this stage of the night were well closed. The latenight corner shop obviously meant something different by âlatenightâ than Dirk did, and though Dirk was certain that he couldconvince the proprietor of the rightness of his case through sheerlinguistic and syllogistic bravado, the wretched man wasnâtthere to undergo it.
A mile away there was a 24-hour filling station, but it turnedout just to have sustained an armed robbery. The plate glass wasshattered and crazed round a tiny hole, police were swarmingover the place. The attendant was apparently not badly injured,but he was still losing blood from a wound in his arm, havinghysterics and being treated for shock, and no one would sellDirk any cigarettes. They simply werenât in the mood.
âYou could buy cigarettes in the blitz,â protested Dirk.âPeople took a pride in it. Even with the bombs falling and thewhole city ablaze you could still get served. Some poor fellow,just lost two daughters and a leg, would still say `Plain or filtertipped?â if you asked him.â
âI expect you would, too,â muttered a white-faced youngpoliceman.
âIt was the spirit of the age,â said Dirk.
âBug off,â said the policeman.
And that, thought Dirk to himself, was the spirit of this. Heretreated, miffed, and decided to prowl the
streets with his handsin his pockets for a while.
Camden Passage. Antique clocks. Antique clothes. Nocigarettes.
Upper Street. Antique buildings being ripped apart. No signof cigarette shops being put up in their place. Chapel Market, desolate at night. Wet litter wildly flapping.Cardboard boxes, egg boxes, paper bags and
cigarette packets-empty ones.
Pentonville Road. Grim concrete monoliths, eyeing the newspaces in Upper Street where they hoped to
spawn their horridprogeny.
Kingâs Cross station. They must have cigarettes, for heavenâssake. Dirk hurried on down towards it.
The old frontage to the station reared up above the area, agreat yellow brick wall with a clock tower and
two huge archesfronting the two great train sheds behind. In front of this lay theone-storey modern concourse which was already far shabbierthan the building, a hundred years its senior, which it obscuredand generally messed up. Dirk imagined that when the designsfor the modern concourse had been drawn up the architects hadexplained that it entered into an exciting and challengingdialogue with the older building.
Kingâs Cross is an area where terrible things happen topeople, to buildings, to cars, to trains, usually while you wait,and if you werenât careful you could easily end up involved in apiece of exciting and challenging dialogue yourself. You couldhave a cheap car radio fitted while you waited, and if you turnedyour back for a couple of minutes, it would be removed whileyou waited as well. Other things you could have removed whileyou waited were your wallet, your stomach lining, your mindand your will to live. The muggers and pushers and pimps andhamburger salesmen, in no particular order, could arrange allthese things for you.
But could they arrange a packet of cigarettes, thought Dirk,with a mounting sense of tension. He crossed York Way,declined a couple of surprising offers on the grounds that theydid not involve cigarettes in any immediately obvious way,hurried past the closed bookshop and in through the mainconcourse doors, away from the life of the street and into thesafer domain of British Rail.
He looked around him.
Here things seemed rather strange and he wondered why, buthe only wondered this very briefly because he was alsowondering if there was anywhere open selling cigarettes andthere wasnât.
He sagged forlornly. It seemed to him that he had beenplaying catch-up with the world all day. The morning hadstarted in about as disastrous a way as it was possible for amorning to start, and he had never managed to get a proper gripon it since. He felt like somebody trying to ride a bolting horse,with one foot in a

stirrup and the other one still bounding alonghopefully on the ground behind. And now even as simple a thingas a cigarette was proving to be beyond his ability to get hold of.
He sighed and found himself a seat, or at least, room on abench.
This was not an immediately easy thing to do. The stationwas more crowded than he had expected to find it at - what wasit? he looked up at the clock - one oâclock in the morning. Whatin the name of God was he doing on Kingâs Cross station at oneoâclock in the morning, with no cigarette and no home that hecould reasonably expect to get into without being hacked todeath by a homicidal bird?
He decided to feel sorry for himself. That would pass thetime. He looked around himself, and after a while the impulse tofeel sorry for himself gradually subsided as he began to take inhis surroundings.
What was strange about it was seeing such an immediatelyfamiliar place looking so unfamiliar. There was the ticket office,still open for ticket sales, but looking sombre and beleagueredand wishing it was closed.
There was the W.H.Smith, closed for the night. No one wouldbe needing any further newspapers or magazines tonight, exceptfor purposes of accommodation, and old ones would do just aswell for sleeping under.
The pimps and hookers, drug-pushers and hamburgersalesmen were all outside in the streets and in the hamburgerbars. If you wanted quick sex or a dirty fix or, God help you, ahamburger, that was where you went to get it.
Here were the people that nobody wanted anything from atall. This was where they gathered for shelter until they wereperiodically shooed out. There was something people wantedfrom them, in fact - their absence. That was in hot demand, butnot easily supplied. Everybody has to be somewhere.
Dirk looked from one to another of the men and womenshuffling round or sitting hunched in seats or struggling to tryand sleep across benches that were specifically designed toprevent them from doing exactly that.
âGot a fag, mate?â
âWhat? No, Iâm sorry. No, I havenât got one,â replied Dirk,awkwardly patting his coat pockets in embarrassment, as if tosuggest the making of a search which he knew would befruitless. He was startled to be summoned out of his reverie likethis.
âHere you are, then.â The old man offered him a beat-up onefrom a beat-up packet.
âWhat? Oh. Oh - thanks. Thank you â Momentarily takenaback by the offer, Dirk nevertheless accepted the cigarettegratefully, and took a light from the tip of the cigarette the oldman was smoking himself.
âWhat you come hene for then?â asked the old man - notchallenging, just curious.
Dirk tried to look at him without making it seem as if he waslooking him up and down. The man was wildly bereft of teeth,had startled and matted hair, and his old clothes were wellmulched down around him, but the eyes which sagged out of hisface were fairly calm. He wasnât expecting anything worse thanhe could deal with to happen to him.
âWell, just this in fact,â said Dirt, twiddling the cigarette.âThanks. Couldnât find one anywhere.â âOh ah,â said the old man.
âGot this mad bird at home,â said Dirk. âKept attacking me.â
âOh ah,â said the man, nodding resignedly.
âI mean an actual bird,â said Dirk, âan eagle.â âOh ah.â
âWith great wings.â
âOh ah.â
âGot hold of me with one of its talons through the letter-box.â
âOh ah.â
Dirk wondered if it was worth pursuing the conversationmuch further. He lapsed into silence and looked
around.
âYouâre lucky it didnât slash at you with its beak as well,âsaid the old man after a while. âAn eagle will do
that whenroused.â
âIt did!â said Dirk. âIt did! Look, right here on my nose. Thatwas through the letter-box as well. Youâd
scarcely believe it!Talk about grip! Talk about reach! Look at what it did to myhand!â He held it out for sympathy. The old man gave it anappraising look.
âOh ah,â he said at last, and retreated into his own thoughts.
Dirk drew his injured hand back.
âKnow a lot about eagles, then, do you?â
The man didnât answer, but seemed instead to retreat stillfurther.

âLot of people here tonight,â Dirk ventured again, after awhile.
The man shrugged. He took a long drag on his cigarette, halfclosing his eyes against the smoke.
âIs it always like this? I mean, are there always so manypeople here at night?â
The man merely looked down, slowly releasing the smokefrom his mouth and nostrils.
Yet again, Dirk looked around. A man a few feet away, not soold-looking as Dirkâs companion but wildly
deranged in hisdemeanour, had sat nodding hectically over a bottle of cookingbrandy all this time. He slowly stopped his nodding, screwedwith difficulty a cap on to the bottle, and slipped it into thepocket of his ragged old coat. An old fat woman who had beenfitfully browsing through the bulging black bin liner of herpossessions began to twist the top of it together and fold it.
âYouâd almost think that something was about to happen,âsaid Dirk.
âOh ah,â said his companion. He put his hands on his knees,bent forward and raised himself painfully to his feet. Though hewas bent and slow, and though his clothes were dirt-ridden andtattered, there was some little power and authority there in hisbearing.
The air which he unsettted as he stood, which flowed outfrom the folds of his skin and ctothes, was richly pungent evento Dirkâs numbed nostrils. It was a smell that never stoppedcoming at you - just as Dirk thought it must have peaked, so itstruck on upwards with renewed frenzy till Dirk thought that hisvery brain would vaporise.
He tried not to choke, indeed he tried to smile courteouslywithout allowing his eyes to run as the man turned to him andsaid, âInfuse some blossom of the bitter orange. Add somesprinklings of sage while it is still warm. This is very good foreagle wounds. There are those who will add apricot and almondoil and even, the heavens defend us, sedra. But then there arealways those that will overdo things. And sometimes we haveneed of them. Oh ah.â
With that he turned away once more and joined the growingstream of pathetic, hunched and abused bodies that were headingfor the front exit from the station. In all about two, maybe threedozen were leaving. Each seemed to be leaving separatety, eachfor his or her entirely independent reasons, and not followingtoo fast the one upon the other, and yet it was not hard to tell, foranyone who cared to watch these people that no one cared towatch or see, that they were leaving together and in a stream.
Dirk carefulty nursed his cigarette for a minute or so andwatched them intently as one by one they left. Once he wascertain that there were no more to go, and that the last two orthree of them were at the door, he dropped the cigarette andground it out with his heel. Then he noticed that the old man hadleft behind his crumpled cigarette packet. Dirk looked inside andsaw that there were still two bedraggled cigarettes left. He poc-keted it, stood up, and quietly followed at a distance that hethought was properly respectful.
Outside on the Euston Road the night air was grumbling andunsettled. He loitered idly by the doorway, watching which waythey went - to the west. He took one of the cigarettes out and litit and then idled off westwards himself, around the taxi rank andtowards St Pancras Street.
On the west side of St Pancras Street, just a few yards northof the Euston Road, a flight of steps leads up to the forecourt ofthe old Midland Grand Hotel, the huge, dark gothic fantasy of abuilding which stands, empty and desolate, across the front of StPancras railway station.
Over the top of the steps, picked out in gold letters onwrought-iron-work, stands the name of the station. Taking histime, Dirk followed the last of the band of old tramps andderelicts up these steps, which emerged just to the side of asmall, squat, brick building which was used as a car-park. To theright, the great dark hulk of the old hotel spread off into thenight, its roofline a vast assortment of wild turrets, gnarledspires and pinnacles which seemed to prod at and goad the nightsky.
High in the dim darkness, silent stone figures stood guardbehind long shields, grouped around pilasters behind wrought-iron railings. Carved dragons crouched gaping at the sky as DirkGently, in his flapping leather coat, approached the great ironportals which led to the hotel, and to the great vaulted train shedof St Pancras station. Stone figures of winged dogs croucheddown from the top of pillars.
Here, in the bridged area between the hotel entrance and thestation booking hall, was parked a large unmarked greyMercedes van. A quick glance at the front of it was enough totell Dirk that it was the same one which had nearly forced himoff the road several hours earlier in the Cotswolds.
Dirk walked into the booking hall, a large space with greatpanelled walls along which were spaced fat marble columns inthe form of tonch holders.
At this time of night the ticket office was closed - trains donot run all night from St Pancras - and beyond it the vastchamber of the station itself, the great Victorian train shed, wasshrouded in darkness and shadow.
Dirk stood quietly secluded in the entrance to the bookinghall and watched as the old tramps and bag tadies, who hadentered the station by the main entrance from the forecourt,mingled together in the dimness.

There were now many morethan two dozen of them, perhaps as many as a hundred, andthere seemed to be about them an air of repressed excitementand tension.
As they moved about it seemed to Dirk after a while that,though he had been surprised at how many of them there hadbeen when he first arrived, there seemed now to be fewer andfewer of them. He peered into the gloom trying to make outwhat was happening. He detached himself from his seclusion inthe entrance to the booking hall and entered the main vault, butkept himself nevertheless as close to the side wall as possible ashe ventured in towards them.
There were definitely fewer still of them now, a mere handfulleft. He had a distinct sense of people slipping away into theshadows and not re-emerging from them.
He frowned at them.
The shadows were deep but they werenât that deep. He beganto hurry forward, and quickly threw all caution aside to reach thesmall remaining group. But by the time he reached the centre ofthe concourse where they had been gathered there were noneremaining at all and he was left whirling round in confusion inthe middle of the great, dark, empty railway station.

Dirk Gently 2 - The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul

Chapter 26
The only thing which prevented Kate screaming was the sheerpressure of air rushing into her lungs as she hurtled into the sky.
When, a few seconds later, the blinding acceleration eased alittle, she found she was gulping and choking, her eyes werestinging and streaming to the extent that she could hardly see,and there was hardly a muscle in her body which wasnâtgibbering with shock as waves of air pummelled past her, tear-ing at her hair and clothes and making her knees, knuckles andteeth batter at each other.
She had to struggle with herself to suppress her urge tostruggle. On the one hand she absolutely certainly did not wantto be let go of. Insofar as she had any understanding at all ofwhat was happening to her she knew that she did not want to belet go of. On the other hand the physical shock of it was facingsome stiff competition from her sheer affronted rage at beingsuddenly hauled into the sky without warning. The result of thiswas that she struggled rather feebly and was angry at herself fordoing so. She ended up clinging to Thorâs arm in the most abjectand undignified way.
The night was dark, and the blessing of this, she supposed,was that she could not see the ground. The lights she had seendotted here and there in the distance now swung sickeninglyaway beneath her, but her instincts would not identify them asrepresenting ground. Already the flickering beacons whichshone from the insanely turreted building she had glimpsedseconds before this outrage occurred were swaying away behindher now at an increasing distance.
They were still ascending.
She could not struggle, she could not speak. She couldprobably, if she tried, bite the stupid bruteâs arm, but shecontented herself with the idea of this rather than the actualdeed.
The air was bad and rasped in her lungs. Her nose and eyeswere streaming, and this made it impossible for her to lookforward. When she did try it, just once, she caught a momentaryblurred glimpse of the head of the hammer streaking out throughthe dark air of them, of Thorâs arm grasping its stuntedhandle and being pulled forward by it. His other arm wasgripped around her waist. The strength of him defied herimagination but did not make her any the less angry.
She got the feeling that they were now skimming along justbeneath the clouds. Every now and then they would be buffetedby damp clamminess, and breathing would become yet harderand more noxious. The wet air tasted bitter, and deadly cold, andher streaming wet hair lashed and slammed about her face.
She decided that the cold was definitely going to kill her, andafter a while was convinced that she was beginning to loseconsciousness. In fact she realised she was actually trying tolose consciousness but she couldnât. Time slipped into agreyness though, and she was less aware of how much of it waspassing.
At last she began to sense that they were slowing and thatthey were beginning to curve back downwards. This precipitatedfresh waves of nausea and disorientation in her, and she felt thather stomach was being slowly turned through a mangle.
The air was, if anything, getting worse. It smelled worse,tasted more acrid and seemed to be getting a great deal moreturbulent. They were definitely slowing now, and the going wasbecoming more and more difficult. The hammer was clearlypointing downwards now, and finding its way along rather thansurging ahead.
Down still further they went, battling through the thickeningclouds that swirled round them till it seemed that they must nowreach all the way down to the ground.
Their speed had dropped to the point where Kate felt able tolook ahead now, though the acridity of the air was such that shewas only able to manage a very brief glance. In the moment thatshe glanced, Thor released the hammer. She couldnât believe it.He released it only for a fraction of a second, just to change hisgrip on the thing, so that they were now hanging from the shaftas it flew slowly forward, rather than being pulled along by it.As he redistributed his weight into this new posture he hoistedKate firmly upwards as if pulling up a sock. Down they went,and down further and further.
There was now a roaring crashing sound borne in on them bythe wind from up ahead, and suddenly Thor was running,leaping over rocky, sandy scrubland, dancing through theknotted tussocks, and finally pounding and drumming his feet toa halt.
They stood still at last, swaying, but the ground on whichthey stood was solid.
Kate breathed for a few seconds, bending over to catch herbreath. She then pulled herself up to her full height and wasabout to deliver a full account of her feelings concerning theseevents at the top of her voice, when she suddenly got analarming sense of where she was standing.
Though the night was dark, the wind whipping at her and thepungent smell of it told her that some kind of

sea was very closeby. The sound of wild crashing breakers told her that in fact itwas more or less beneath her, that they were standing very nearto the edge of a cliff. She gripped the arm of the insufferable godwho had brought her here and hoped, vainly, that it hurt him.
As her reeling senses began gradually to calm down shenoticed that there was a dim light spreading away before her,and after a while she realised that this was coming off the sea.
The whole sea was glowing like an infection. It was rearingitself up in the night, lunging and thrashing in a turmoil of itselfand then smashing itself to pieces in a frenzy of pain against therocks of the coast. Sea and sky seethed at each other in apoisonous fury.
Kate watched it speechlessly, and then became aware of Thorstanding at her shoulder.
âI met you at an airport,â he said, his voice breaking up in thewind. âI was trying to get home to Norway by plane.â Hepointed out to sea. âI wanted you to see why I couldnât comethis way.â
âWhere are we? What is this?â asked Kate fearfully.
âIn your world, this is the North Sea,â said Thor and turnedaway inland again, walking heavily and dragging his hammerbehind him.
Kate pulled her wet coat close around her and hurried afterhim.
âWell, why didnât you just fly home the way we just did butin, well, in our world?â
The rage in her had subsided into vague worries aboutvocabulary.
âI tried,â responded Thor, still walking away.
âWell, what happened?â
âI donât want to talk about it.â
âWhat on earthâs the point of that?â
âIâm not going to discuss it.â
Kate shuddered in exasperation. âIs this godlike behaviour?âshe shouted. âIt bothers you so you wonât talk
about it?â
âThor! Thor! Is it you?â
This last was a thin voice trailing over the wind. Kate peeredinto the wind. Through the darkness a lantern
was bobbingtowards them from behind a low rise.
âIs that you, Thor?â A little old lady came into view, holdinga lantern above her head, hobbling
enthusiastically. âI thoughtthat must be your hammer I saw. Welcome!â she chirruped.âOh, but you come in dismal times. I was just putting the pot onand thinking of having a cup of something and then perhapskilling myself, but then I said to myself, just wait a couple ofdays longer, Tsuliwa..., Tsuwila..., Swuli..., Tsuliwansis - Ican never pronounce my own name properly when Iâm talkingto myself, and it drives me hopping mad, as Iâm sure you canimagine, such a bright boy as Iâve always maintained, nevermind what those others say, so I said to myself, Tsuliwansis,see if anyone comes along, and if they donât, well, then might bea good time to think about killing myself. And look! Now hereyou are! Oh, but you are welcome, welcome! And I see youâvebrought a little friend. Are you going to introduce me? Hello,my dear, hello! My nameâs Tsuliwansis and I wonât be at alloffended if you stutter.â
âI... Iâm, er, Kate,â said Kate, totally flummoxed.
âYes, well Iâm sure that will be all right,â said the old womansharply. âAnyway, come along if youâre coming. If youâre goingto hang around out here all night I may as well just get straighton with killing myself now and let you get your own tea whenyouâre quite ready. Come along!â
She hurried on ahead, and in a very few yards they reached aterrible kind of ramshackle structure of wood and mud whichlooked as if it had become unaccountably stuck while half waythrough collapsing. Kate glanced at Thor, hoping to read somekind of reaction from him to give her a bearing on the situation,but he was occupied with his own thoughts and was clearly notabout to share them. Thene seemed to her to be a difference inthe way he moved, though. In the brief experience she had ofhim he seemed constantly to be struggling with some internaland constrained anger, and this, she felt, had lifted. Not goneaway, just lifted. He stood aside to allow her to enterTsuliwansisâs shack, and brusquely gestured her to go in. Hefollowed, ducking absurdly, a few seconds later, having pausedfor a moment outside to survey what little could be seen of thesurrounding landscape.
Inside was tiny. A few boards with straw for a bed, asimmering pot hung over a fire, and a box tucked away in thecorner for sitting on.
âAnd this is the knife I was thinking of using, you see,â saidTsuliwansis, fussing around. âJust been sharpening it up nicely,you see. It comes up very nice if you get a nice sweeping actionwith the stone, and I was thinking here would be a good place,you see? Here on the wall, I can stick the handle in this crack soitâs held nice and firm, and then just go fling! And fling myselfat it. Fling! You see? I wonder, should it be a little

lower, whatdo you think, my dear? Know about these things, do you?â
Kate explained that she did not, and managed to soundreasonably calm about it.
âTsuliwansis,â said Thor, âwe have come not to stay butto...Tsuli - please put the knife down.â Tsuliwansis was standing looking up at them quite chirpily,but she was also holding the knife, with its
great heavy sweepingblade, poised over her own left wrist.
âDonât mind me, dears,â she said, âIâm quite comfortable. Ican just pop off any time Iâm ready. Happy to.
These times arenot to live in. Oh, no. You go off and be happy. I wonât disturbyour happiness with the sound of me screaming. Iâll hardlymake a sound with the knife as you go.â She stood quiveringand challenging.
Carefully, almost gently, Thor reached out and drew the knifeaway and out of her shaking hand. The old woman seemed tocrumple as it went, and all the performance faded out of her. Shesat back in a heap on her box. Thor squatted down in front ofher, slowly drew her to him and hugged her. She graduallyseemed to come back to life, and eventually pushed him awaytelling him not to be so stupid, and then made a bit of a fuss ofsmoothing out her hopelessly ragged and dirty black dress.
When once she had composed herself properly she turned herattention to Kate and looked her up and down.
âYouâre a mortal, dear, arenât you?â she said at last.
âWell... yes,â said Kate.
âI can tell it from your fancy dress. Oh, yes. Well, now yousee what the world looks like from the other
side, donât you,dear? What do you think then?â
Kate explained that she did not yet know what to think. Thorsat himself down on the floor and leant his
big head back againstthe wall, half-closing his eyes. Kate had the sense that he waspreparing himself for something.
âIt used to be things were not so different,â continued the oldwoman. âUsed to be lovely here, you know, all lovely. Bit ofgive and take between us. Terrible rows, of course, terriblefights, but really it was all lovely. Now?â She let out a long andtired sigh, and brushed a bit of nothing much off the wall.
âOh, things are bad,â she said, âthings are very bad. You seethings get affected by things. Our world affects your world, yourworld affects our world. Sometimes it is hard to know exactlywhat that effect is. Very often it is hard to like it, either. Most ofthem, these days, are difficult and bad. But our worlds are sonearly the same in so many ways. Where in your world you havea building there will be a structure here as well. Maybe it will bea small muddy hillock, or a beehive, or an abode like this one.Maybe it will be something a little grander, but it will besomething. You all right, Thor, dear?â
The Thunder God closed his eyes and nodded. His elbows layeasily across his knees. The ragged strips of Kateâs nightgownbound about his left forearm were limp and wet. He idly pushedthem off.
âAnd where there is something which is not dealt withproperly in your world,â the old lady pranled on, âas like as notit will emerge in ours. Nothing disappears. No guilty secret. Nounspoken thought. It may be a new and mighty god in our world,or it may be just a gnat, but it will be here. I might add that thesedays it is more often a gnat than a new and mighty god. Oh,there are so many more gnats and fewer immortal gods thanonce there were.â
âHow can there be fewer immortals?â asked Kate. âI donâtwant to be pedantic about it, but - â
âWell, thereâs being immortal, dear, and then again thereâsbeing immortal. I mean, if I could just get this knife properlysecured and then work up a really good fling, weâd soon seewho was immortal and who wasnât.â
âTsuli...â admonished Thor, but didnât open his eyes to do it.
âOne by one weâre going, though. We are, Thor. Youâre oneof the few that care. Thereâs few enough now that havenâtsuccumbed to alcoholism or the onx.â
âWhat is that? Some kind of disease?â asked Kate. She wasbeginning to feel cross again. Having been dragged unwillinglyfrom her flat and hurled across the whole of East Anglia on theend of a hammer, she was irritated at being then just abandonedto a conversation with an insanely suicidal old woman whileThor just sat and looked content with himself, leaving her tomake an effort she was not in a mood to make.
âItâs an affliction, dear, which only gods get. It really meansthat you canât take being a god any more, which is why onlygods get it you see.â
âI see.â
âIn the final stages of it you simply lie on the ground andafter a while a tree grows out of your head and then itâs all over.You rejoin the earth, seep into its bowels, flow through its vitalarteries, and eventually emerge as a great pure torrent of water,and as like as not get a load of chemical waste dumped into you.Itâs a grim business being a god nowadays, even a dead god.
âWell,â she said, patting her knees. Her eyes hovered onThor, who had opened his eyes but was only

using them to stareat his own knuckles and fingertips. âWell, I hear you have anappointment tonight, Thor.â âHmm,â grunted Thor, without moving.
âI hear youâve called together the Great Hall for theChallenging Hour, is that right?â
âHmm,â said Thor.
âThe Challenging Hour, hmm? Well, I know that things havenot been too good between you and your father for a long time.Hmm?â
Thor wasnât going to be drawn. He said nothing.
âI thought it was quite dreadful about Wales,â continuedTsuliwansis. âDonât know why you stood for it. Of course Irealise that heâs your father and the All-Father which makes itdifficult. But, Odin, Odin - Iâve known him for so long. Youknow that he made a deal once to sacrifice one of his own eyesin exchange for wisdom? Of course you do, dear, youâre his son,arenât you? Well, what Iâve always said is he should stand upand make a fuss about that particular deal, demand his eye back.Do you know what I mean by that, Thor? And that horrible ToeRag. Thereâs someone to be careful of, Thor, very carefulindeed. Well, I expect I shall hear all about it in the morning,wonât I?â
Thor slid his back up the wall and stood up. He clasped theold woman warmly by the hands and smiled a tight smile, butsaid nothing. With a slight nod he gestured to Kate that theywere leaving. Since leaving was what she most wanted in all theworld to do she resisted the temptation to say âOh yeah?â andkick up a fuss about being treated like this. Meekly she bade apolite farewell to the old woman and made her way out into themurky night. Thor followed her.
She folded her arms and said, âWell? Where now? Whatother great social events have you got in store for me thisevening?â
Thor prowled around a linle, examining the ground. Hepulled out his hammer, and weighed it appreciatively in hishands. He peered out into the night, and swung the hammer acouple of times, idly. He swung himself round a couple of times,again not hard. He loosed the hammer, which bounded off intothe night and split open a casually situated rock a couple ofdozen yards away and then bounded back. He caught it easily,tossed it up into the air and caught it easily again.
Then he turned to her and looked her in the eye for the firsttime. âWould you like to see something?â he asked.

Dirk Gently 2 - The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul

Chapter 27
A gust of wind blew through the huge vaults of the emptystation and nearly provoked in Dirk a great howl of frustration atthe trail that had so suddenly gone cold on him. The coldmoonlight draped itself through the long ranges of glass panelsthat extended the length of the St Pancras station roof.
It fell on empty rails, and illuminated them. It fell on the traindepartures board, it fell on the sign which explained that todaywas a Blue Saver Day and illuminated them both.
Framed in the archway formed by the far end of the vaultedroof were the fantastical forms of five great gasometers, thesupporting superstructures of which seemed in theiradumbrations to be tangled impossibly with each other, like thehoops of an illusionistâs conjuring trick. The moonlightilluminated these as well, but Dirk it did not illuminate.
He had watched upwards of a hundred people or so simplyvanish into thin air in a way that was completely impossible.That in itself did not give him a problem. The impossible did notbother him unduly. If it could not possibly be done, thenobviously it had been done impossibly. The question was how?
He paced the area of the station which they had all vanishedfrom, and scanned everything that could be seen from everyvantage point within it, looking for any clue, any anomaly,anything that might let him pass into whatever it was he had justseen a hundred people pass into as if it was nothing. He had thesense of a major party taking place in the near vicinity, to whichhe had not been invited. In desperation he started to spin aroundwith his arms outstretched, then decided this was completelyfutile and lit a cigarette instead.
He noticed that as he had pulled out the packet, a piece ofpaper had fluttered from his pocket, which, once the cigarettewas burning well, he stooped to retrieve.
It was nothing exciting, just the bill he had picked up fromthe stroppy nurse in the caf. âOutrageous,â he thought abouteach of the items in turn as he scanned down them, and wasabout to screw it up and throw it away when a thought struckhim about the general layout of the document.
The items charged were listed down the left hand side, andthe actual charges down the right.
On his own bills when he issued them, when he had a client,which was rare at the moment, and the ones he did have seemedunable to stay alive long enough to receive his bills and beoutraged by them, he usually went to a little trouble about theitems charged. He constructed essays, little paragraphs todescribe them. He liked the client to feel that he or she wasgetting his or her moneyâs worth in this respect at least.
In short, the bills he issued corresponded in layout almostexactly to the wad of papers with indecipherable runic scriptswhich he had been unable to make head or tail of a couple ofhours previously. Was that helpful? He didnât know. If the wadwas not a contract but a bill, what might it be the bill for? Whatservices had been performed? They must certainly have beenintricate services. Or at least, intricately described services.Which professions might that apply to? It was at least somethingto think about. He screwed up the caf bill and moved off tothrow it into a bin.
As it happened, this was a fortuitous move.
It meant that he was away from the central open space of thestation, and near a wall against which he could press himselfinconspicuously when he suddenly heard the sound of two pairsof feet crossing the forecourt outside.
In a few seconds, they entered the main part of the station, bywhich time Dirk was well out of sight round the angle of a wall.
Being well out of sight worked less well for him in anotherrespect, which was that for a while he was unable to see theowners of the feet. By the time he caught a glimpse of them,they had reached exactly the same area where a few minutespreviously a small horde of people had, quietly and without fuss,vanished.
He was surprised by the red spectacles of the woman and thequietly tailred Italian suit of the man, and also the speed withwhich they themselves then immediately vanished.
Dirk stood speechless. The same two damn people who hadbeen the bane of his life for the entire day (he allowed himselfthis slight exaggeration on the grounds of extreme provocation)had now flagrantly and deliberately disappeared in front of hiseyes.
Once he was quite certain that they had absolutely definitelyvanished and were not merely hiding behind each other, heventured out once more into the mysterious space.
It was bafflingly ordinary. Ordinary tarmacadam, ordinaryair, ordinary everything. And yet a quantity of people that wouldhave kept the Bermuda triangle industry happy for an entiredecade had just vanished in it within the space of five minutes.
He was deeply aggravated.

He was so deeply aggravated that he thought he would sharethe sense of aggravation by phoning someone up andaggravating them - as it would be almost certain to do at twentypast one in the morning.
This wasnât an entirely arbitrary thought - he was stillanxious concerning the safety of the American girl, KateSchechter, and had not been at all reassuned to have beenanswered by her machine when last he had called. By now sheshould surely be at home and in bed asleep, and would bereassuringly livid to be woken by a meddling phone call at thistime.
He found a couple of coins and a working telephone anddialled her number. He got her answering machine again.
It said that she had just out for the night to Asgard.She wasnât certain which parts of Asgard they were going to butthey would probably swing by Valhalla later, if the evening wasup to it. If he cared to leave a message she would deal with it inthe morning if she was still alive and in the mood. There weresome beeps, which rang on in Dirkâs ear for seconds after heheard them.
âOh,â he said, realising that the machine was currently busytaping him, âgood heavens. Well, I thought the arrangement wasthat you were going to call me befone doing anythingimpossible.â
He put the phone down, his head spinning angrily. Valhalla,eh? Was that where everybody was going to tonight except him?He had a good mind to go home, go to bed and wake up in thegrocery business.
Valhalla.
He looked about him once again, with the name Valhallaringing in his ears. There was no doubt, he felt, that a space thissize would make a good feasting hall for gods and dead heroes,and that the empty Midland Grand Hotel would be almost worthmoving the shebang from Norway for.
He wondered if it made any difference knowing what it wasyou were walking into.
Nervously, tentatively, he walked across and through thespace in question. Nothing. Oh well. He turned, andstood surveying it for a moment or two while he took a coupleof slow drags on the cigarette he had got from the tramp. Thespace didnât look any different.
He walked back through it again, this time a little lesstentatively, but with slow positive steps. Once again, nothinghappened, but then just as he was moving out of it at the end hehalf fancied that he half heard a half moment of some kind ofraucous sound, like a burst of white noise on a twisted radio dial.He turned once more, and headed back into the space, movinghis head carefully round trying to pick up the slightest sound.For a while he didnât catch it, then suddenly there was a snatchof it that burst around him and was gone. A movement andanother snatch. He moved very, very slowly and carefully. Withthe most slight and gentle movements, trying to catch at thesound he moved his head round what seemed like a billionthpart of a billionth part of a degree, slipped behind a moleculeand was gone.
He had instantly to duck to avoid a great eagle swooping outof the vast space at him.

Dirk Gently 2 - The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul

Chapter 28
It was another eagle, a different eagle. The next one was adifferent eagle too, and the next. The air seemed to be thick witheagles, and it was obviously impossible to enter Valhallawithout getting swooped on by at least half a dozen of them.Even eagles were being swooped on by eagles.
Dirk threw up his arms over his head to fend off the wild,beating flurries, turned, tripped and fell down behind a hugetable on to a floor of heavy, damp, earthy straw. His hat rolledunder the table. He scrambled after it, stuffed it back firmly onhis head, and slowly peered up over the table.
The hall was dark, but alive with great bonfires.
Noise and woodsmoke filled the air, and the smells ofroasting pigs, roasting sheep, roasting boar, and sweat andreeking wine and singed eagle wings.
The table he was crouched behind was one of countless slabsof oak on trestles that stretched in every direction, laden withsteaming hunks of dead animals, huge breads, great iron beakersslopping with wine and candles like wax anthills. Massivesweaty figures seethed around them, on them, eating, drinking,fighting over the food, fighting in the food, fighting with thefood.
A yard or so from Dirk, a warrior was standing on top of atable fighting a pig which had been roasting for six hours, and hewas clearly losing, but losing with vim and spirit and beingcheered on by other warriors who were dousing him down withwine from a trough.
The roof - as much of it as could be made out at this distance,and by the dark and flickering light of the bonfires - was madeof lashed-together shields.
Dirk clutched his hat, kept his head down and ran, trying tomake his way towards the side of the hall. As he ran, feelinghimself to be virtually invisible by reason of being completelysober and, by his own lights, normally dressed, he seemed topass examples of every form of bodily function imaginable,other than actual teeth-cleaning.
The smell, like that of the tramp in Kingâs Cross station, whomust surely be here participating, was one that never stoppedcoming at you. It grew and grew until it seemed that your headhad to become bigger and bigger to accommodate it. The din ofsword on sword, sword on shield, sword on flesh, flesh on fleshwas one that made the eardrums reel and quiver and want to cry.He was pummelled, tripped, elbowed, shoved and drenched withwine as he scumed and pushed through the wild throng, butarrived at last at a side wall - massive slabs of wood and stonefaced with sheets of stinking cow hide.
Panting, he stopped for a moment, looked back and surveyedthe scene with amazement.
It was Valhalla.
Of that there would be absolutely no question. This was notsomething that could be mocked up by a
catering company. Andthe whole seething, wild mass of carousing gods and warriorsand their caroused-at ladies, with their shields and fires andboars did seem to fill a space that must be somethingapproaching the size of St Pancras station. The sheer heat thatrose off it all seemed as if it should suffocate the flocks ofderanged eagles which thrashed through the air above them.
And maybe it was. He was by no means certain that a flock ofenraged eagles which thought that they might be suffocatingwould behave significantly differently from many of the eagleshe was currently watching.
There was something he had been putting off wonderingwhile he had fought his way through the mass, but the time hadcome to wonder it now.
What, he wondered, about the Draycotts?
What could the Draycotts possibly be doing here? Andwhene, in such a mle, could the Draycotts possibly be?
He narrowed his eyes and peered into the heaving throng, try-ing to see if he could locate anywhere a pair of red designerspectacles or a quiet Italian suit mingling out there with theclanging breastplates and the sweaty leathers, knowing that theattempt was futile but feeling that it should be made.
No, he decided, he couldnât see them. Not, he felt, their kindof party. Further reflections along these lines were cut short by aheavy short-handled axe which hurtled through the air andburied itself with an astounding thud in the wall about threeinches from his left ear and for a moment blotted out all thought.
When he recovered from the shock of it, and let his breathout, he thought that it was probably not somethiog that had beenthrown at him with malicious intent, but was merely warriorlyhigh spirits. Nevertheless, he was not in a partying mood anddecided to move on. He edged his way along the wall in thedirection which, had this actually been St Pancras station ratherthan the hall of Valhalla, would have led to the ticket office. Hedidnât know what he would find there, but he reckoned that itmust be different to this,

which would be good.
It seemed to him that things were generally quieter here, outon the periphery.
The biggest and best of the good tunes soemed to beconcentrated more strongly towanls the middle of the
hall,whereas the tables he was passing now seemed to be peopledwith those who looked as if they had teached that season in theirimmortal lives when they preferred to contemplate the timeswhen they used to wrestle dead pigs, and to pass appreciativecomments to each other about the finer points of dead pigwrestling technique, than actually to wrestle with one againthemselves just at the moment.
He overheard one remark to his companion that it was theleft-handed three-fingered flat grip on the opponentâs sternumthat was all-important at the crucial moment of finally not quitefalling over in a complete stupor, to which his companionresponded with a benign âOh ah.â
Dirk stopped, looked and backtracked.
Sitting hunched in a thoughtful posture over his iron plate,and clad in heavily stained and matted furs and buckles whichwere, if anything, more rank and stinking than the ensembleDirk had last encountered him in, was Dirkâs companion fromthe concourse at Kingâs Cross station.
Dirk wondered how to approach him. A quick backslap and aâHey! Good party. Lot of energy,â was one strategy, but Dirkdidnât think it was the right one.
While he was wondering, an eagle suddenly swooped downfrom out of the air and, with a lot of beating and thrashing,landed on the table in front of the old man, folded its wings andadvanced on him, demanding to be fed. Easily, the old manpulled a bit of meat off a bone and held it up to the great bird,which pecked it sharply but accurately out of his fingers.
Dirk thought that this was the key to a friendly approach. Heleant over the table and picked up a small hunk of meat andoffered it in turn to the bird. The bird attacked him and went forhis neck, forcing him to try and beat the savage creature off withhis hat, but the introduction was made.
âOh ah,â said the man, shooed the eagle away and shifted acouple of inches along the bench. Though it was not a fulsomeinvitation, it was at least an invitation. Dirk clambered over thebench and sat down.
`âThank you,â said Dirk, puffing.
âOh ah.â
âIf you remember, we - â
At that moment the most tremendous reverberating thumpsounded out across Velhalla. It was the sound of
a drum beingbeaten, but it sounded like a drum of immense proportions, as ithad to be to make itself heard over the tumult of noise withwhich the hall was filled. The drum sounded three times, in slowand massive beats, like the heartbeat of the hall itself.
Dirk looked up to see where the sound might have comefrom. He noticed for the first time that at the south end of thehall, to which he had been heading, a great balcony or bridgeextended across most of its width. There were some figures upthere, dimly visible through the heat haze and the eagles, butDirk had a sense that whoever was up there presided overwhoever was down here.
Odin, thought Dirk. Odin the All-Father must be up on thebalcony.
The sound of the revels died down quickly, though it wasseveral seconds before the reverberations of the noise finally fellaway.
When all was quiet, but expectant, a great voice rang outfrom the balcony and through the hall.
The voice said, ââThe time of the Challenging Hour is nearlyat an end. The Challenging Hour has been called by theGod Thor. For the third time of asking, where is Thor?â
A murmuring throughout the hall suggested that nobodyknew where Thor was and why he had not come to make hischallenge.
The voice said, âThis is a very grave affront to the dignity ofthe All-Father. If there is no challenge before the expiration ofthe hour, the penalty for Thor shall be correspondingly grave.â
The drum beat again three times, and the consternation in thehall increased. Where was Thor?
âHeâs with some girl,â said a voice above the rest, and therewere loud shouts of laughter, and a return to the hubbub ofbefore.
âYes.â said Dirk, quietly, âI expect he probably is.â
âOh ah.â
Dirk had supposed that he was talking to himself and wassurprised to have elicited a response from the
man, though notparticularly surprised at the response that had been elicited. âThor called this meeting tonight?â Dirk asked him.
âOh ah.â
âBit rude not to turn up.â

âOh ah.â
âI expect everyoneâs n bit upset.â
âNot as long as thereâs enough pigs to go round.â
âPigs?â
âOh ah.â
Dirk didnât immediately know how to go on from here.
âOh ah,â he said, resignedly.
âItâs only Thor as really cares, you see,â said the old man.âKeeps on issuing his challenge, then not being
able to prove it.Canât argue. Gets all confused and angry, does somethingstupid, canât sort it out and gets made to do a penance.Everybody else just turns up for the pigs.â
âOh ah.â Dirk was learning a whole new conversationaltechnique and was astonished at how successful it was. Heregarded the man with a new-found respect.
âDo you know how many stones there are in Wales?â askedthe man suddenly. âOh ah,â said Dirk warily. He didnât know this joke.
âNor do I. He wonât tell anybody. Says count âem yourselfand goes off in a sulk.â âOh ah.â He didnât think it was a very good one.
âSo this time he hasnât even turned up. Canât say I blamehim. But Iâm sorry, because I think he might be right.â
âOh ah.â
The man lapsed into silence.
Dirk waited.
âOh ah,â he said again, hopefully.
Nothing.
âSo, er,â said Dirk, going for a cautious prompt, âyou thinkhe might be right, eh?â
âOh ah.â
âSo.Old Thor might be right, eh? Thatâs the story,â saidDirk.
âOh ah.â
âIn what way,â said Dirk, running out of patience at last, âdoyou think he might be right?â
âOh, every way.â
âOh ah,â said Dirk, defeated.
âItâs no secret that the gods have fallen on hard times,â saidthe old man, grimly. âThatâs clear for all to
see, even for theones who only care about the pigs,which is most of âem. Andwhen you feel youâre not needed any more it can be hard tothink beyond the next pig,even if you used to have the wholeworld there with you. Everyone just accepts it as inevitable.Everyone except Thor, that is. And now heâs given up. Hasnâteven bothered to turn up and break a pig with us.Given up hischallenge. Oh ah.â
âOh ah,â said Dirk.
âOh ah.â
âSo, er, Thorâs challenge then,â said Dirk tentatively.
âOh ah.â
âWhat was it?â
âOh ah.â
Dirk lost his patience entirely and rounded on the man.
âWhat was Thorâs challenge to Odin?â he insisted angrily.
The man looked round at him in slow surprise,lookcd him upand down with his big sagging eyes.
âYouâre a mortal, arenât you?â
âYes,â said Dirk testily, âIâm a mortal. Of course Iâm amortal. What has being a mortal got to do with it?â âHow did you get here?â
âI followed you.â He pulled the screwed up, empty cigarettepacket out of his pocket and put it on the
table. âThanks,â hesaid, âI owe you.â
It was a pretty feeble type of apology, he thought, but it wasthe best he could manage.
âOh ah.â The man looked away.
âWhat was Thorâs challenge to Odin?â said Dirk, trying hardto keep the impatience out of his voice this
time.
âWhat does it matter to you?â the old immortal said bitterly.âYouâre a mortal. Why should you care?
Youâve got what youwant out of it, you and your kind, for what little itâs now worth.â âGot what we want out of what?â

âThe deal,â said the old immortal. âThe contract that Thorclaims Odin has entered into.â
âContract?â said Dirk. âWhat contract?â
The manâs face filled with an expression of slow anger. Thebonfires of Valhalla danced deeply in his eyes
as he looked atDirk.
âThe sale,â he said darkly, âof an immortal soul.â
âWhat?â said Dirk. He had already considered this idea anddiscounted it. âYou mean a man has sold his
soul to him? Whatman? It doesnât make sense.â
âNo,â said the man, âthat wouldnât make sense at all. I saidan immortal soul. Thor says that Odin has sold
his soul to Man.â
Dirk stared at him with horror and then slowly raised his eyesto the balcony. Something was happening
there. The great drumbeat out again, and the hall of Valhalla began to hush itself oncemore. But a second or third drumbeat failed to come. Somethingunexpected seemed to have occurred, and the figures on thebalcony were moving in some confusion. The Challenging Hourwas just expiring, but a challenge of some kind seemed to havearrived.
Dirk beat his palms to his forehead and swayed where he satas all kinds of realisations finally dawned on him.
âNot to Man,â he said, âbut to a man, and a woman. A lawyerand an advertiser. I said it was all her fault the moment I sawher. I didnât realise I might actually be right.â He rounded on hiscompanion urgently. âI have to get up there,â he said, âfor Godsâsake, help me.â

Dirk Gently 2 - The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul

âO...dddddiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnn!!!!!!!â
Chapter 29
Thor let out a bellow of rage which made the sky shake. Theheavy clouds let out a surprised grunt of thunder at the sheervolume of air that moved beneath them. Kate started back, whitewith fear and shock, with her ears ringing.
âToe Rag!!!!â
He hurled his hammer to the ground right at his very feet withboth hands. He hurled it this short distance with such astoundingforce that it hit and rebounded into the air up to about a hundredfeet.
âGgggrrrrrraaaaaaaah!!!!!!â With an immense explosion of airfrom his lungs he hurled himself up into the air after it, caught itjust as it was beginning to drop, and hurled it straight back downat the ground again, catching it again as it bounded back up,twisting violently round in mid-air and hurling it with all theforce he could muster out to sea before falling to the groundhimself on his back, and pounding the earth with his ankles,elbows and fists in an incredible tattoo of rage.
The hammer shot out over the sea on a very low trajectory.The head went down into the water and planed through it at aconstant depth of about six inches. A sharp ripple opened slowlybut easily across its surface, extending eventually to about amile as the hammer sliced its way through it like a surgeonâsknife. The inner walls of the ripple deepened smoothly in itswake, falling away from the sheer force of the hammer, till avast valley had opened in the face of the sea. The walls of thevalley wobbled and swayed uncertainly, then folded up andcrashed together in crazed and foaming tumult. The hammerlifted its head and swung up high into the air. Thor leapt to hisfeet and watched it, still pounding his feet on the ground like aboxer, but like a boxer who was perhaps about to precipitate amajor earthquake. When the hammer reached the top of itstrajectory, Thor hurled his fist downwards like a conductor, andthe hammer hurtled down into the crashing mass of sea.
That seemed to calm the sea for a moment in the same waythat a smack in the face will calm a hysteric. The momentpassed. An immense column of watcr crupted out of the smack,and seconds later the hammer exploded upwards out of itscentre, pulling another huge column of water up from the middleof the first one.
The hammer somersaulted at the top of its rise, turned, spun,and rushed back to its owner like a wildly over-excited puppy.Thor caught at it, but instead of stopping it he allowed it to carryhim backwards, and together they tumbled back through therocks for about a hundred yards and scuffled to a halt in somesoft earth.
Instantly, Thor was back on his feet again. He turned roundand round, bounding from one leg to the other with strides ofnearly ten feet, swinging the hammer round him at armâs length.When he released it again it raced out to sea once more, but thistime it tore round the surface in a giant semicircle, causing thesea to rear up around its circumference to form for a moment agigantic amphitheatre of water. When it fell forward it crashedlike a tidal wave, ran forward and threw itself, enraged, againstthe short wall of the cliff.
The hammer returned to Thor, who threw it off againinstantly in a great overarm. It flew into a rock, hitting off a fatangry spark. It bounded off further and hit a spark off anotherrock, and another. Thor threw himself forward on to his knees,and with each rock the hammer hit he pounded the ground withhis fist to make the rock rise to meet the hammer. Spark afterspark erupted from the rocks. The hammer hit each successiveone harder and harder, until one spark provoked a warning lickof lightning from the clouds.
And then the sky began to move, slowly, like a great angryanimal uncoiling in its lair. The pounding sparks flew faster andheavier from the hammer, more lightning licks arced down tomeet them from the sky, and the whole earth was beginning totremble in something very like fearful excitement.
Thor hauled his elbows up above his head and then thrustthem hard down with another ringing bellow at the sky.
âO...ddddiiiiiiinnnnnn!!!!â
The sky seemed about to crack open.
âToe Raaaaagggggggggg!!!!!!!!!â
Thor throw himself into the ground, heaving aside about twoskipsful of rocky carth. He shook with
expanding rage. With adeep groan the whole of the side of the cliff began slowly to leanforward into the sea as he pushed and shook. In a few secondsmore it tumbled heavily into the seething torment beneath it asThor clambered back, seized a rock the size of a grand piano andheld it above his head.
Everything seemed still for a fleeting moment. Thor hurled the rock into the sea.
He regained his hammer.
âO...!â he bellowed.

â...Ddddddddinnnnnnn!!!!!!!!!!â
His hammer cracked down.
A torrent of water erupted from the ground, and the skyexploded. Lightning flickered down like a white
wall of light formiles along the coast in either direction. Thunder roared likecolliding worlds and the clouds vomited rain that shattered theground. Thor stood exulting in the torrent.
A few minutes later and the violence abated. A strong andsteady rain continued to fall. The clouds were cleansingthemselves and the weak rays of the early morning light beganto find their way through the thinning cover.
Thor trudged back up from where he had been standing,slapping and washing the mud from his hands. He caught at hishammer when it flew to him.
He found Kate standing watching him, shivering withastonishment, fear and fury.
âWhat was that all about?â she yelled at him.
âI just needed to be able to lose my temper properly,â he said.When this didnât seem to satisfy her he
added, âA god can showoff once in a while canât he?â
The huddled figure of Tsuliwansis came hurrying outthrough the rain towards them.
âYouâre a noisy boy, Thor,â she scolded, âa noisy boy.â
But Thor was gone. When they looked, they guessed that hemust be the tiny speck hurtling northwards
through the clearingsky.

Dirk Gently 2 - The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul

Chapter 30
Cynthia Draycott peered over the balcony at the sceene belowthem with distaste. Valhalla was back in full swing.
âI hate this,â she said, âI donât want this going on in my life.â
âYou donât have to, my darling,â said Clive Draycott quietlyfrom behind her, with his hands on her shoulders. âItâs all goingto be taken care of right now, and itâs going to work out justfine. Couldnât be better in fact. Itâs just what we wanted. Youknow, you look fantastic in those glasses? They really suit you. Imean really. Theyâre very chic.â
âClive, it was meant to have been taken care of originally.The whole point was that we werenât to be troubled, we couldjust do it, deal with it, and forget about it. That was the wholepoint. Iâve put up with enough shit in my life. I just wanted it tobe good, 100 per cent. I donât want all this.â
âExactly. And thatâs why this is so perfect for us. So perfect.Clear breach of contract. We get everything we wanted now, andweâre released from all obligations. Perfecto. We come out of itsmelling of roses, and we have a life that is just 100 per centgood. 100 per cent. And clean. Just exactly as you wanted it.Really, it couldnât be better for us. Trust me.â
Cynthia Draycott hugged herself irritably.
âSo what about this new...person? Something else we have todeal with.â
âItâll be so easy. So easy. Listen, this is nothing. We eithercut him in to it, or we cut him right out. Itâll be
taken care ofbefore we leave here. Weâll buy him something. A new coat.Maybe weâll have to buy him a new house. Know what thatâllcost us?â He gave a charming laugh. âItâs nothing. You wonâtever even need to think about it. You wonât ever even need tothink about not thinking about it. Itâs... that... easy. OK?â
âHm.â
âOK. Iâll be right back.â
He turned and headed back into the ante-chamber of the hallof the All-Fattier, smiling all the way.
âSo, Mr... â he made a show of looking at the card againâ... Gently. You want to act for these people do
you?â
âThese immortal gods,â said Dirk.
âOK, gods,â said Draycott. ââThatâs fine. Perhaps youâll do abetter job than the manic little hustler I had to
deal with firsttime out. You know, heâs really quite a little character, our MrRag, Mr Rag. You know, that guy was really quite amazing. Hedid everything he could, tried every oldest trick in the book tofreak me out, and give me the run-around. You know how I dealwith people like that? Simple. I ignore it. I just...ignone it. If hewants to play around and threaten and screech, and shovel infive hundred and seventeen subclauses that he thinks heâs goingto catch me out on, thatâs OK. Heâs just taking up time, but sowhat? Iâve got time. Iâve got plenty of time for people like MrRag. Because you know what the really crazy thing is? Youknow whatâs really crazy? The guy cannot draw up an actualcontract to save his life. Really. To save...his...life. And I tellyou something, thatâs fine by me. He can thrash around and spitall he likes - when he gets tired I just reel him in. Listen. I drawup contracts in the recond business. These guys are just minnowsby comparison. Theyâre primitive savages. Youâve met them.Youâve dealt with them. Theyâre primitive savages. Well, arenâtthey? Like the Red Indians. They donât even know what theyâvegot. You know, these people are lucky they didnât meet somereal shark. I mean it. You know what America cost? You knowwhat the whole United States of America actually cost? Youdonât, and neither do I. And shall I tell you why? The sum is sonegligible that someone could tell us what it was and twominutes later we would have forgotten. It would have gone cleanout of our minds.
âNow, compared with that, let me tell you, I am providing. Iam really providing. A private suite in the Woodshead Hospital?Lavish attention, food, sensational quantities of linen.Sensational. You could practically buy the United States ofAmerica at todayâs prices for what thatâs all costing. But youknow what? I said, if he wants the linen, let him have the linen.Just let him have it. Itâs fine. The guyâs earned it. He can haveall the linen...he...wants. Just donât fuck with me is all.
âNow let me tell you, this guy has a nice life. A nice life. AndI think thatâs what we all want, isnât it. A nice life. This guycertainly did. And he didnât know how to have it. None of theseguys did. Theyâre just kind of helpless in the modern world. Itâskind of tough for them and Iâm just trying to help out. Let metell you how nave they are, and I mean nave.
âMy wife, Cynthia, youâve met her, and let me tell you, she isthe best. I tell you, my relationship with Cynthia is so good- â
âI donât want to hear about your relationship with your wife.â

âOK. Thatâs fine. Thatâs absolutely fine. I just think maybeitâs worth you getting to know a few things. But whatever youwant is fine. OK. Cynthiaâs in advertising. You know that. Sheis a senior partner in a major agency. Major. They did some bigcampaign, really big, a few years back in which some actor isplaying a god in this commercial. And heâs endorsing some-thing, I donât know, a soft drink, you know, tooth rot for kids.
And Odin at this time is just a down and out. Heâs living onthe streets. He simply canât get anything together, because heâsjust not for this world. All that power, but he doesnâtknow how to make it work for him here, today. Now hereâs thecrazy part.
âOdin sees this commercial on the television and he thinks tohimself, `Hey, I could do that, Iâm a god.â He thinks maybe hecould get paid for being in a commercial. And you know whatthat would be. Pays even less than the United States of Americacost, you follow me? Think about it. Odin, the chief and fount ofall the power of all of the Norse gods, thinks he might be able toget paid for being in a television commercial to sell soft drinks.
âAnd this guy, this god, literally goes out and tries to findsomeone whoâll let him in a TV commercial. Pathetically nave.But also greedy - letâs not forget greedy.
âAnyway, he happens to come to Cynthiaâs attention. Sheâsjust a lowly account executive at the time, doesnât pay anyattention, thinks heâs just a whacko, but then she gets kind offascinated by how odd he is, and I get to see him. And you knowwhat? It dawns on us heâs for real. The guy is for real. A realactual god with the whole panoply of divine powers. And notonly a god, but like, the main one. The one all the others dependon for their power. And he wants to be in a commercial. Letâsjust say the word again shall we? A commercial.
âThe idea was dumbfounding. Didnât the guy know what hehad? Didnât he realise what his power could get him?
âApparently not. I have to tell you, this was the mostastounding moment in our lives. A...stoun...ding. Let me tellyou, Cynthia and I have always known that we were, well,special people, and that something special would happen to us,and here it was. Something special.
âBut look. Weâre not greedy. We donât want all that power,all that wealth. And I mean, weâre looking at the world here.The whole...fucking...world. We could own the world if wewanted to. But who wants to own the world? Think of thetrouble. We donât even want huge wealth, all those lawyersaccountants to deal with, and let me tell you Iâm a layer. OK,so you can hire people to look after your lawyers andaccountants for you, but who are those people going to be? Justmore lawyers and accountants. And you know, we donât evenwant the responsibility for it all. Itâs too much.
âSo then I have this idea. Itâs like you buy a big property, andthen you sell on what you donât want. That way you get whatyou want, and a lot of other people get what they want, onlythey get it through you, and they feel a little obligated to you,and they remember who they got it through because they sign apiece of paper which says how obligated they feel to you. Andmoney flows back to pay for our Mr Odinâs very, very, veryexpensive private medical care.
âSo we donât have much, Mr Gently. One or two modestlynice houses. One or two modestly nice cars. We have a very nicelife. Very, very nice indeed. We donât need much becauseanything we need is always made available to us, itâs taken careof. All we demanded, and it was a very reasonable demand inthe circumstances, was that we didnât want to know any moreabout it. We take our modest requirements and we bow out. Wewant nothing more than absolute peace and absolute quiet, and anice life because Cynthiaâs sometimes a little nervous. OK.
âAnd then what happens this morning? Right on our owndoorstep. Pow. Itâs disgusting. I mean it is really a disgustinglittle number. And you know how it happened?
âHereâs how it happened. Itâs our friend Mr Rag again, andheâs tried to be a clever tricky little voodoo lawyer. Itâs sopathetic. He has fun trying to waste my time with all his littletricks and games and run-arounds, and then he tries to faze meby presenting me with a bill for his time. Thatâs nothing. Itâswork creation. All lawyers do it. OK. So I say, Iâll take your bill.Iâll take it, I donât care what it is. You give me your bill and Iâllsee itâs taken care of. Itâs OK. So he gives it to me.
âItâs only later I see itâs got this tricky kind of subtotal thingin it. So what? Heâs trying to be clever. Heâs given me a hotpotato. Listen, the record business is full of hot potatoes. Youjust get them taken care of. There are always people happy totake care of things for you when they want to make their way upthe ladder. If theyâre worthy of their place on the ladder, well,theyâll get it taken care of in return. You get a hot potato, youpass it on. I passed it on. Listen, there were a lot of people whoare very happy to get things taken care of for me. Hey, youknow? It was really funny seeing how far and how fast thatparticular potato got passed on. That told me a lot about whowas bright and who was not. But then it lands up in my backgarden, and thatâs a penalty clause job Iâm afraid. TheWoodshead stuff is a very expensive little number, and I thinkyour clients may have

blown it on that particular score. We havethe whip hand here. We can just cancel this whole thing. Believeme, I have everything I could possibly want now.
âBut listen, Mr Gently. I think you understand my position.Weâve been pretty frank with each other and Iâve felt goodabout that. There are certain sensitivities involved, of course,and Iâm also in a position to be able to make a lot of thingshappen. So perhaps we can come to any one of a number ofpossible accommodations. Anything you want, Mr Gently, it canbe made to happen.â
âJust to see you dead, Mr Draycott,â said Dirk Gently, âjustto see you dead.â
âWell fuck you, too.â
Dirk Gently turned and left the room and went to tell his newclient that he thought they might have a
problem.

Dirk Gently 2 - The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul

Chapter 31
A tittle while later a dark-blue BMVV pulled quietly nway franthe otherwise deserted forecourt of St Pancras stadon and movedoff up the quiet streets.
Somewhat dejected, Dirk Gently put on his hat and left hisnewly acquired and newly relinquished client who said that hewished to be alone now and maybe turn into a rat or somethinglike some other people he could mention.
He closed the great doors behind him and walked slowly outon to the balcony overlooking the great vaulted hall of gods andheroes, Valhalla. He arrived just as the last few stragglers of therevels were fading away, presumably to emerge at the samemoment in the great vaulted train shed of St Pancras station. Hestayed staring for a while at the empty hall, in which the bonfiresnow were just fading embers.
It then took the very slightest flicker of his head for him toperform the same transition himself, and he found himselfstanding in a gusty and dishevelled corridor of the emptyMidland Grand Hotel. Out in the great dark concourse of StPancras station he saw again the last stragglers from Valhallashuffling away and out into the cold streets of London to findbenches that were designed not to be slept on, and to try to sleepon them.
He sighed and tried to find his way out of the derelict hotel, atask that proved more difficult than he anticipated, as immenseand as dark and as labyrinthine as it was. He found at last thegreat winding gothic staircase which led all the way down to thehuge arches of the entrance lobby, decorated with carvings ofdragons and griffins and heavy ornamental ironwork. The mainfront entrance was locked as it had been for years, andeventually Dirk found his way down a side corridor to an exitmanned by a great sweaty splodge of a man who guarded it atnight. He demanded to know how Dirk had gained entrance tothe hotel and refused to be satisfied by any of his explanations.In the end he had simply to allow Dirk to leave, since there waslittle else he could do.
Dirk crossed from this entrance to the entrance into thestation booking hall, and then into the station itself. For a whilehe simply stood there looking around, and then he left via themain station entrance, and descended the steps which led downon to the St Pancras Road. As he emerged on to the street he wasso surprised not to be instantly swooped upon by a passing eaglethat he tripped and stumbled and was run over by the first of theearly morningâs motorcycle couriers.

Dirk Gently 2 - The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul

Chapter 32
With a huge crash, Thor surged through the wall at the far end ofthe great hall of Valhalla and stood ready to proclaim to theassembled gods and heroes that he had finally managed to breakthrough to Norway and had found a copy of the contract Odinhad signed buried deep in the side of a mountain, but he couldnâtbecause theyâd all gone and there was no one there.
âThereâs no one here,â he said to Kate, releasing her from hishuge grip, âtheyâve all gone.â
He slumped in disappointment.
âWh - â said Kate.
âWeâll try the old manâs chambers,â said Thor and hurled hishammer up to the balcony, with themselves
in tow.
He stalked through the great chambers, ignoring Kateâs pleas,protests and general abuse.
He wasnât there.
âHeâs here somewhere,â said Thor angrily, trailing hishammer behind him.
âWeâll go through the world divide,â he said, and took holdof Kate again. They flicked themselves
through.
They were in a large bedroom suite in the hotel.
Litter and scraps of rotting carpet covered the floors, thewindows were grimy with years of neglect.
Pigeon droppingswere everywhere, and the peeling paintwork made it look as ifseveral small families of starfish had exploded on the walls.
Thene was an abandoned trolleybed in the middle of the floorin which an old man lay in beautifully laundered linen, weepingfrom his one remaining eye.
âI found the contract, you bastard,â raged Thor, waving it athim. âI found the deal you did. You sold all our power to...to alawyer and a...an advertiser and, and all sorts of other people.You stole our power! You couldnât steal all of mine because Iâmtoo strong, but you kept me bewildered and confused, and madebad things happen every time I got angry. You prevented megetting back home to Norway by every method you could,because you knew Iâd find this! You and that poison dwarf ToeRag. Youâve been abusing and humiliating me for years, and - â
âYes, yes, we know all that,â said Odin. âWell...Good!â
âThor - â said Kate.
âWell Iâve shaken all that off now!â shouted Thor. âYes, I see - â
âI went somewhere I could get good and angry in pence,when I knew youâd be otherwise occupied and expecting me tobe here, and I had a hell of a good shout and blew things up abit, and Iâm all right now! And Iâm going to tear this up for astart!â
He ripped right through the contract, threw the pieces in theair and incinerated them with a look.
âThor - â said Kate.
âAnd Iâm going to put right all the things you made happenso Iâd be afraid of getting angry. The poor girl
at the airlinecheck-in desk that got turned into a drink machine. Woof!Wham! Sheâs back! The jet fighter that tried to shoot me downwhen I was flying to Norway! Woof! Wham! Itâs back! See, Iâmback in control of myself!â
âWhat jet fighter?â asked Kate. âYou havenât told meabout a jet fighter.â
âIt tried to shoot me down over the North Sea. We had ascrap and in the heat of the moment I, well, I turned it intoan eagle, and itâs been bothering me ever since. So nowthatâs dealt with. Donât look at me like that. I did what Icould. I took care of his wife by fixing one of those lotterythings. Look,â he added angrily, âall this has been very dif-ficult for me, you know. All right. What else?â
âMy table lamp,â said Kate quietly.
âAnd Kateâs table lamp! It shall be a small kitten no more!Woof! Wham! Thor speaks and it is so! What was that noise?â
A ruddy glow was spreading across the London skyline.
Thor, I think thereâs something wrong with your father.â
âI should bloody well hope so. Oh. Whatâs wrong? Father?Are you all right?â
âI have been so very, very foolish and unwise,â wept Odin, âIhave been so wicked and evil, and - â
âYes, well thatâs what I think, too,â said Thor and sat on thecnd of his bed. âSo what are we going to do?â

âI donât think I could live without my linen, and my SisterBailey, and... Itâs been so, so, so long, and Iâm so, so old. ToeRag said I should kill you, but I...I would rather have killedmyself. Oh, Thor...â
âOh,â said Thor. âI see. Well. I donât know what to do now.Blast. Blast everything.â âThor -â
âYes, yes, what is it?â
âThor, itâs very simple what you do about your father and theWoodshead,â said Kate. âOh yes? What then?â
âIâll tell you on one condition.â
âOh really? And whatâs that?â
âThat you tell me how many stones there are in Wales.â
âWhat!â exclaimed Thor in outrage. âAway from me! Thatâsyears of my life youâre talking about!â
Kate shrugged.
âNo!â said Thor. âAnything but that! Anyway, he addedsullenly, âI told you.â
âNo you didnât.â
âYes I did. I said I lost count somewhere in Mid-Glamorgan.Well, I was hardly going to start again, was I?
Think, girl,think!Chapter 33
Beating a path through the difficult territory to the north-east ofValhalla - a network of paths that seemed
to lead only to otherpaths and then back to the first paths again for another try - wenttwo figures, one a big, stupid, violent creature with green eyesand a scythe which hung from its belt and often seriously imped-ed its progress, the other a small crazed creature who clung on tothe back of the bigger one, manically urging him on white actu-aily impeding his progress still further.
They attained at last a long, low, smelly building into whichthey hurried shouting for horses. The old stable master cameforward, recognised them and, having heard already of theirdisgrace, was at first disinclined to help them on their way. âThescythe flashed through the air and the stable masterâs headstarted upwards in surprise while his body took an affronted stepbackwards, swayed uncertainly, and then for lack of any furtherinstructions to the contrary keeled over backwards in its owntime. His head bounded into the hay.
His assailants hurriedly lashed up two horses to a cart andclattered away out of the stable yard and along the broaderthoroughfare which led upwards to the north.
They made rapid progress up the road for a mile, Toe Ragurging the horses on frantically with a long and cruel whip.After a few minutes, however, the horses began to slow downand to look about them uneasily. Toe Rag lashed them all theharder, but they became more anxious still then suddenly lost allcontrol and reared in terror, turning over the cart and tipping itsoccupants out on the ground, from which they instantly sprangup in a rage.
Toe Rag screamed at the terrified horses and then, out of thecorner of his eye, caught sight of what had so disturbed them.
It wasnât so terrifying. It was just a large, white, metal box,upturned on a pile of rubbish by the roadside and rattling itself.
The horses were rearing and trying to bolt away from the bigwhite rattling thing but they were impossibly entangled in theirtraces. They were only working themselves up into a thrashinglather of panic. Toe Rag quickly realised that there would be nocalming them until the box was dealt with.
âWhatever it is,â he screeched at the green-eyed creature,âkill it!â
Green-eye unhooked his scythe from his belt once more andclambered up the pile of rubbish to where the box was rattling.He kicked it and it only rattled the more. He got his foot behindit and with a heavy thrust shoved it away down the heap. Thebig white box slithered a foot or so then turned over and toppledto the ground. It rested there for a moment and then a door,finally freed, flew open. The horses screamed in fear.
Toe Rag and his green-eyed thug approached the thing withworried curiosity, then staggered back in horror as a great andpowerful new god erupted from its innards.
Chapter 34
The following afternoon, at a comfortable distance from alIthese events, set at a comfortable distance from a well-proportioned window through which the afternoon light wasstreaming, lay an elderly one-eyed man in a white bed. Anewspaper sat like a half-collapsed tent on the floor, where ithad been hurled two minutes before.
The man was awake but not glad to be. His exquisitely frailhands lay slightly curled on the pure white linen sheets andquivered very faintly.
His name was variously given as Mr Odwin, or Wodin, orOdin. He was - is - a god, and furthermore he was a confusedand startled god.
He was confused and startled because of the report he hadjust been reading on the front page of the

newspaper, which wasthat another god had been cutting loose and making a nuisanceof himself. It didnât say so in so many words of course, it merelydescribed what had happened last night when a missing jetfighter aircraft had mysteriously erupted under full power fromout of a house in North London into which it could notconceivably have been thought to have fitted. It had instantlylost its wings and gone into a screaming dive and crashed andexploded in a main road. The pilot had managed to eject duringthe few seconds he had had in the air, and had landed, shaken,bruised, but otherwise unharmed, and babbling about strangemen with hammers flying over the North Sea.
Luckily, because of the time at which the inexplicabledisaster had occurred, the roads were almost deserted, and apartfrom massive damage to property, the only fatalities to haveoccurred were the as yet unidentified occupants of a car whichwas thought to have been possibly a BMW and possibly blue,though because of the rather extreme nature of the accidcnt itwas rather hard to tell.
He was very, very tired and did not want to think about it,did not want to think about last night, did not want to think ofanything other than linen sheets and how wonderful it was whenSister Bailey patted them down around him as she had just now,just five minutes ago, and again just ten minutes before that.
The American girl, Kate something, came into his room. Hewished she would just let him sleep. She was going on aboutsomething being all fixed up. She congratulated him on havingextremely high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels and avery dicky heart, as a consequence of which the hospital wouldbe very glad to accept him as a lifelong patient in return for hisentire estate. They didnât even care to know what his estate wasworth, because it would clearly be sufficient to cover a stay asbrief as his was likely to be.
She seemed to expect him to be pleased, so he noddedamiably, thanked her vaguely and drifted, drifted happily off tosleep.
Chapter 35
The same afternoon Dirk Gently awake, also in hospital,suffering from mild concussion, scrapes and bruises and abroken leg. He had had the greatest difficulty in explaining, onadmittance, that most of his injuries had been caused by a smallboy and an eagle, and that really, being run over by a motorcyclecourier was a relatively restful experience since it mostlyinvolved lying down a lot and not being swooped on every twominutes.
He was kept under sedation - in other words, he slept - formost of the morning, suffering terrible dreams in which Toe Ragand a green-eyed, scythe-bearing giant made their escape to thenorth-east from Valhalla, where they were unexpectedlyaccosted and consumed by a newly created, immense Guilt Godwhich had finally escaped from what looked suspiciously like anupturned refrigerator on a skip.
He was relieved to be woken at last from this by a cheery,âOh itâs you, is it? You nicked my book.â
He opened his eyes and was greeted by the sight of SallyMills, the girl he had been violently accosted by the previousday in the caf, for no better reason than that he had, prior tonicking her book, nicked her coffee.
âWell, Iâm glad to see you took my advice and came in tohave your nose properly attended to,â she said as she fussedaround him. âPretty roundabout way you seem to have takenbut youâre here and thatâs the main thing. You caught up withthe girl you were interested in did you? Oddly enough, youâre inthe very bed that she was in. If you see her again, perhaps youcould give her this pizza which she arranged to have deliveredbefore checking herself out. Itâs all cold now, but the courier didinsist that she was very adamant it should be delivered.
âI donât mind you nicking the book, really, though. I donâtknow why I buy them really, theyâre not very good, onlyeveryone always does, donât they? Somebody told me thereâs arumour he had entered into a pact with the devil or something. Ithink thatâs nonsense, though I did hear another story about himwhich I much preferred. Apparently heâs always having thesemysterious deliveries of chickens to his hotel rooms, and no onedares to ask why or even guess what it is he wants them for,because nobody ever sees a single scrap of them again. Well, Imet somebody who knows exactly what he wants them for. Thesomebody I met once had the job of secretly smuggling thechickens straight back out of his rooms again. What HowardBelt gets out of it is a reputation for being a very strange anddemonic man and everybody buys his books. Nice work if youcan get it is what I say. Anyway, I expect you donât want to haveme nattering to you alt afternoon, and even if you do Iâve gotbetter things to do. Sister says youâll probably be discharged thisevening so you can go to your own home and sleep in your ownbed, which Iâm sure youâll much prefer. Anyway, hope you feelbetter, hereâs a couple of newspapers.â
Dirk took the papers, glad to be left alone at last.
He first turned to see what The Great Zaganza had to sayabout his day. The Great Zaganza said, âYou are very fat andstupid and persistently wear a ridiculous hat which you shouldbe ashamed of.â
He grunted slightly to himself about this, and turned to the

horoscope in the other paper.
It said, âToday is a day to enjoy home comforts.â
Yes, he thought, he would be glad to get back home. He wasstill strangely relieved about getting rid of his
old fridgelooked forwand to enjoying a new phase of fridge ownershipwith the spanking new model currently sitting in his kitchen athome.

This time there would be no witnesses.
This time there was just the dead earth, a rumble of thunder, and the onset of that interminable light drizzle from the north-east by which so many of the worldâs most momentous events seem to be accompanied.
The storms of the day before, and of the day before that, and the floods of the previous week, had now abated. The skies still bulged with rain, but all that actually fell in the gathering evening gloom was a dreary kind of prickle.
Some wind whipped across the darkening plain, blundered through the low hills and gusted across a shallow valley where stood a structure, a kind of tower, alone in a nightmare of mud, and leaning.
It was a blackened stump of a tower. It stood like an extrusion of magma from one of the more pestilential pits of hell, and it leaned at a peculiar angle, as if oppressed by something altogether more terrible than its own considerable weight. It seemed a dead thing, long ages dead.
The only movement was that of a river of mud that moved sluggishly along the bottom of the valley past the tower. A mile or so further on, the river ran down a ravine and disappeared underground.
But as the evening darkened it became apparent that the tower was not entirely without life. There was a single dim red light guttering deep within it.
The light was only just visible -- except of course that there was no one to see, no witnesses, not this time, but it was nevertheless a light. Every few minutes it grew a little stronger and a little brighter and then faded slowly away almost to nothing. At the same time a low keening noise drifted out on the
wind, built up to a kind of wailing climax, and then it too faded, abjectly, away.
Time passed, and then another light appeared, a smaller, mobile light. It emerged at ground level and moved in a single bobbing circuit of the tower, pausing occasionally on its way around. Then it, and the shadowy figure that could just be discerned carrying it, disappeared inside once more.
An hour passed, and by the end of it the darkness was total. The world seemed dead, the night a blankness.
And then the glow appeared again near the towerâs peak, this time growing in power more purposefully. It quickly reached the peak of brightness it had previously attained, and then kept going, increasing, increasing. The keening sound that accompanied it rose in pitch and stridency until it became a wailing scream. The scream screamed on and on till it became a blinding noise and the light a deafening redness.
And then, abruptly, both ceased.
There was a millisecond of silent darkness.
An astonishing pale new light billowed and bulged from deep within the mud beneath the tower. The sky clenched, a mountain of mud convulsed, earth and sky bellowed at each other, there was a horrible pinkness, a sudden greenness, a lingering orangeness that stained the clouds, and then the light sank and the night at last was deeply, hideously dark. There was no further sound other than the soft tinkle of water.
But in the morning the sun rose with an unaccustomed sparkle on a day that was, or seemed to be, or at least would have seemed to be if there had been anybody there to whom it could seem to be anything at all, warmer, clearer and brighter -- an altogether livelier day than any yet known. A clear river ran through the shattered remains of the valley.
And time began seriously to pass.

CHAPTER 2
High on a rocky promontory sat an Electric Monk on a bored horse. From under its rough woven cowl the Monk gazed unblinkingly down into another valley, with which it was having a problem.
The day was hot, the sun stood in an empty hazy sky and beat down upon the grey rocks and the scrubby, parched grass. Nothing moved, not even the Monk. The horseâs tail moved a little, swishing slightly to try and move a little air, but that was all. Otherwise, nothing moved.The Electric Monk was a labour- saving device, like a dishwasher or a video recorder. Dishwashers washed tedious dishes for you, thus saving you the bother of washing them
yourself, video recorders watched tedious television for you, thus saving you the bother of looking at it yourself; Electric Monks believed things for you, thus saving you what was becoming an increasingly onerous task, that of believing all the things the world expected you to believe.
Unfortunately this Electric Monk had developed a fault, and had started to believe all kinds of things, more or less at random. It was even beginning to believe things theyâd have difficulty believing in Salt Lake City. It had never heard of Salt Lake City, of course. Nor had it ever heard of a quingigillion, which was roughly the number of miles between this valley and the Great Salt Lake of Utah.
The problem with the valley was this. The Monk currently believed that the valley and everything in the valley and around it, including the Monk itself and the Monkâs horse, was a uniform shade of pale pink. This made for a certain difficulty in distinguishing any one thing from any other thing, and therefore made doing anything or going anywhere impossible, or at least difficult and dangerous. Hence the immobility of the Monk and the boredom of the horse, which had had to put up with a lot of silly things in its time but was secretly of the opinion that this was one of the silliest.
How long did the Monk believe these things?
Well, as far as the Monk was concerned, forever. The faith which moves mountains, or at least believes them against all the available evidence to be

pink, was a solid and abiding faith, a great rock against which the world could hurl whatever it would, yet it would not be shaken. In practice, the horse knew, twenty-four hours was usually about its lot.
So what of this horse, then, that actually held opinions, and was sceptical about things? Unusual behaviour for a horse, wasnât it? An unusual horse perhaps?
No. Although it was certainly a handsome and well-built example of its species, it was none the less a perfectly ordinary horse, such as convergent evolution has produced in many of the places that life is to be found. They have always understood a great deal more than they let on. It is difficult to be sat on all day, every day, by some other creature, without forming an opinion about them.
On the other hand, it is perfectly possible to sit all day, every day, on top of another creature and not have the slightest thought about them whatsoever.
When the early models of these Monks were built, it was felt to be important that they be instantly recognisable as artificial objects. There must be no danger of their looking at all like real people. You wouldnât want your video recorder lounging around on the sofa all day while it was watching TV. You wouldnât want it picking its nose, drinking beer and sending out for pizzas.
So the Monks were built with an eye for originality of design and also for practical horse-riding ability. This was important. People, and indeed things, looked more sincere on a horse. So two legs were held to be both more suitable and cheaper than the more normal primes of seventeen, nineteen or twenty-three; the skin the Monks were given was pinkish-looking instead of purple, soft and smooth instead of crenellated. They were also restricted to just one mouth and nose, but were given instead an additional eye, making for a grand total of two. A strange-looking creature indeed. But truly excellent at believing the most preposterous things.
This Monk had first gone wrong when it was simply given too much to believe in one day. It was, by mistake, cross-connected to a video recorder that was watching eleven TV channels simultaneously, and this caused it to blow a

bank of illogic circuits. The video recorder only had to watch them, of course. It didnât have to believe them all as well. This is why instruction manuals are so important.
So after a hectic week of believing that war was peace, that good was bad, that the moon was made of blue cheese, and that God needed a lot of money sent to a certain box number, the Monk started to believe that thirty-five percent of all tables were hermaphrodites, and then broke down. The man from the Monk shop said that it needed a whole new motherboard, but then pointed out that the new improved Monk Plus models were twice as powerful, had an entirely new multi-tasking Negative Capability feature that allowed them to hold up to sixteen entirely different and contradictory ideas in memory simultaneously without generating any irritating system errors, were twice as fast and at least three times as glib, and you could have a whole new one for less than the cost of replacing the motherboard of the old model.
That was it. Done.
The faulty Monk was turned out into the desert where it could believe what it liked, including the idea that it had been hard done by. It was allowed to keep its horse, since horses were so cheap to make.
For a number of days and nights, which it variously believed to be three, forty-three, and five hundred and ninety-eight thousand seven hundred and three, it roamed the desert, putting its simple Electric trust in rocks, birds, clouds and a form of non-existent elephant-asparagus, until at last it fetched up here, on this high rock, overlooking a valley that was not, despite the deep fervour of the Monkâs belief, pink. Not even a little bit.
Time passed.
CHAPTER 3
Time passed.

Susan waited.
The more Susan waited, the more the doorbell didnât ring. Or the phone. She looked at her watch. She felt that now was about the time that she could legitimately begin to feel cross. She was cross already, of course, but that had been in her own time, so to speak. They were well and truly into his time now, and even allowing for traffic, mishaps, and general vagueness and dilatoriness, it was now well over half an hour past the time that he had insisted was the latest time they could possibly afford to leave, so sheâd better be ready.
She tried to worry that something terrible had happened to him, but didnât believe it for a moment. Nothing terrible ever happened to him, though she was beginning to think that it was time it damn well did. If nothing terrible happened to him soon maybe sheâd do it herself. Now there was an idea.
She threw herself crossly into the armchair and watched the news on television. The news made her cross. She flipped the remote control and watched something on another channel for a bit. She didnât know what it was, but it also made her cross. Perhaps she should phone. She was damned if she was going to phone. Perhaps if she phoned he would phone her at the same moment and not be able to get through.
She refused to admit that she had even thought that.
Damn him, where was he? Who cared where he was anyway? She didnât, that was for sure.
Three times in a row heâd done this. Three times in a row was enough. She angrily flipped channels one more time. There was a programme about computers and some interesting new developments in the field of things you could do with computers and music.
That was it. That was really it. She knew that she had told herself that that was it only seconds earlier, but this was now the final real ultimate it.

She jumped to her feet and went to the phone, gripping an angry Filofax. She flipped briskly through it and dialed a number.
âHello, Michael? Yes, itâs Susan. Susan Way. You said I should call you if I was free this evening and I said Iâd rather be dead in a ditch, remember? Well, I suddenly discover that I am free, absolutely, completely and utterly free, and there isnât a decent ditch for miles around. Make your move while youâve got your chance is my advice to you. Iâll be at the Tangiers Club in half an hour.â
She pulled on her shoes and coat, paused when she remembered that it was Thursday and that she should put a fresh, extra-long tape on the answering machine, and two minutes later was out of the front door. When at last the phone did ring the answering machine said sweetly that Susan Way could not come to the phone just at the moment, but that if the caller would like to leave a message, she would get back to them as soon as possible. Maybe.
CHAPTER 4
It was a chill November evening of the old-fashioned type.
The moon looked pale and wan, as if it shouldnât be up on a night like this. It roseunwillinglyand hung like an ill spectre. Silhouetted against it, dim and hazy through the dampness which rose from the unwholesome fens, stood the assorted towers and turrets of St Ceddâs, Cambridge, a ghostly profusion of buildings thrown up over centuries, medieval next to Victorian, Odeon next to Tudor. Only rising through the mist did they seem remotely to belong to one another.
Between them scurried figures, hurrying from one dim pool of light toanother, shivering, leavingwraiths ofbreath which folded themselves into the cold night behind them.
It was seven oâclock. Many of the figures were heading for the college

dining hall which divided First Court from Second Court, and from which warm light, reluctantly, streamed. Two figures in particular seemed ill-matched. One, a young man, was tall, thin and angular; even muffled inside a heavy dark coat he walked a little like an affronted heron.
The other was small,roundish,andmoved with an ungainly restlessness, like a number of elderly squirrels trying to escape from a sack. His own age was on the older side of completely indeterminate. If you picked a number at random, he was probably a little older than that, but -- well, it was impossible to tell. Certainly his face was heavily lined, and the small amount of hair that escaped from under his red woollen skiing hat was thin, white, and had very much its own ideas about how it wished to arrange itself. He too was muffled inside a heavy coat, but over it he wore a billowing gown with very faded purple trim, the badge of his unique and peculiar academic office.
As they walked the older man was doing all the talking. He was pointing at items of interest along the way, despite the fact that it was too dark to see any of them. The younger man was saying âAh yes,â and âReally? How interesting...â and âWell, well, well,â and âGood heavens.â His head bobbed seriously.
They entered, not through the main entrance to the hall, but through a small doorway on the east side of the court. This led to the Senior Combination Room and a dark-panelled anteroom where the Fellows of the college assembled to slap their hands and make âbrrrrrrâ noises before making their way through their own entrance to the High Table.
They were late and shook off their coats hurriedly. This was complicated for the older man by the necessity first of taking off his professorial gown, and then of putting it back on again once his coat was off, then of stuffing his hat in his coat pocket, then of wondering where heâd put his scarf, and then of realising that he hadnât brought it, then of fishing in his coat pocket for his handkerchief, then of fishing in his other coat pocket for his spectacles, and finally of finding them quite unexpectedly wrapped in his scarf, which it
turned out he had brought after all but hadnât been wearing despite the damp and bitter wind blowing in like a witchâs breath from across the fens.He bustled the younger man into the hall ahead of him and they took the last two vacant

seats at the High Table, braving a flurry of frowns and raised eyebrows for interrupting the Latin grace to do so.
Hall was full tonight. It was always more popularwith the undergraduates in the colder months. More unusually, the hall was candlelit, as it was now only on very few special occasions. Two long, crowded tables stretchedoffinto the glimmering darkness.By candlelight, peopleâs faces were more alive, the hushed sounds of their voices, the clink of cutlery and glasses, seemed more exciting, and in the dark recesses of the great hall, all the centuries for which it had existed seemed present at once. High Table itself formed a crosspiece at the top, and was raised about a foot above the rest. Since it was a guest night, the table was set on both sides to accommodate the extra numbers, and many diners therefore sat with their backs to the rest of the hall.
âSo, young MacDuff,â said the Professor once he was seated and flapping his napkin open, âpleasure to see you again, my dear fellow. Glad you could come. No idea what all this is about,â he added, peering round the hall in consternation. âAll the candles and silver and business. Generally means a special dinner in honour of someone or something no one can remember anything about except that it means better food for a night.â
He paused and thought for a moment, and then said, âIt seems odd, donât you think, that the quality of the food should vary inversely with the brightness of the lighting. Makes you wonder what culinary heights the kitchen staff could rise to if you confined them to perpetual darkness. Could be worth a try, I think. Got some good vaults in the college that could be turned over to the purpose. I think I showed you round them once, hmmm? Nice brickwork.â
All this came as something of a relief to his guest. It was the first indication his host hadgiven that he had thefaintest recollectionwhohe was. Professor Urban Chronotis, the Regius Professor of Chronology, or âRegâ as he insisted on being called had a memory that he himself had once compared to the Queen Alexandra Birdwing Butterfly, in that it was colourful, flitted prettily hither and thither, and was now, alas, almost completely extinct.
When he had telephoned with the invitation a few days previously, he had seemed extremely keen to see his former pupil, and yet when Richard had

arrived this evening, a little on the late side, admittedly, the Professor had thrown open the door apparently in anger, had started in surprise on seeing Richard, demanded to know if he was having emotional problems, reacted in annoyance to being reminded gently that it was now ten years since he had been Richardâs college tutor, and finally agreed that Richard had indeed come for dinner, whereupon he, the Professor, had started talking rapidly and at length about the history of the college architecture, a sure sign that his mind was elsewhere entirely.âRegâ had never actually taught Richard, he had only been his college tutor, which meant in short that he had had charge of his general welfare, told him when the exams were and not to take drugs, and so on. Indeed, it was not entirely clear if Reg had ever taught anybody at all and what, if anything, he would have taught them. His professorship was an obscure one, to say the least, and since he dispensed with his lecturing duties by the simple and time-honoured technique of presenting all his potential students with an exhaustive list of books that he knew for a fact had been out of print for thirty years, then flying into a tantrum if they failed to find them, no one had ever discovered the precise nature of his academic
discipline. He had, of course, long ago taken the precaution of removing the only extant copies of the books on his reading list from the university and college libraries, as a result of which he had plenty of time to, well, to do whatever it was he did.
Since Richard had always managed to get on reasonably well with the old fruitcake, he had one day plucked up courage to ask him what, exactly, the Regius Professorship of Chronology was. It had been one of those light summery days when the world seems about to burst with pleasure at simply being itself, and Reg had been in an uncharacteristically forthcoming mood as they had walked over the bridge where the River Cam divided the older parts of the college from the newer.
âSinecure, my dear fellow, an absolute sinecure,â he had beamed. âA small amount of money for a very small, or shall we say non-existent, amount of work. That puts me permanently just ahead of the game, which is a comfortable if frugal place to spend your life. I recommend it.â He leaned over the edge of the bridge and started to point out a particular brick that he found interesting. âBut what sort of study is it supposed to be?â Richard had pursued. âIs it history? Physics? Philosophy? What?â

âWell,â said Reg, slowly, âsince youâre interested, the chair was originally instituted by King George III, who, as you know, entertained a number of amusing notions, including the belief that one of the trees in Windsor Great Park was in fact Frederick the Great.
âIt was his own appointment, hence âRegiusâ. His own idea as well, which is somewhat more unusual.â
Sunlight played along the River Cam. People in punts happily shouted at each other to fuck off. Thin natural scientists who had spent months locked away in their rooms growing white and fishlike, emerged blinking into the light. Couples walking along the bank got so excited about the general wonderfulness of it all that they had to pop inside for an hour.
âThe poor beleaguered fellow,â Reg continued, âGeorge III, I mean, was, as you may know, obsessed with time. Filled the palace with clocks. Wound them incessantly. Sometimes would get up in the middle of the night and prowl round the palace in his nightshirt winding clocks. He was very concerned that time continued to go forward, you see. So many terrible things had occurred in his life that he was terrified that any of them might happen again if time were ever allowed to slip backwards even for a moment. A very understandable fear, especially if youâre barking mad, as Iâm afraid to say, with the very greatest sympathy for the poor fellow, he undoubtedly was. He appointed me, or rather I should say, my office, this professorship, you understand, the post that I am now privileged to hold to -- where was I? Oh yes. He instituted this, er, Chair of Chronology to see if there was any particular reason why one thing happened after another and if there was any way of stopping it. Since the answers to the three questions were, I knew immediately, yes, no, and maybe, I realised I could then take the rest of my career off.â
âAnd your predecessors?â
âEr, were much of the same mind.â âBut who were they?â

âWho were they? Well, splendid fellows of course, splendid to a man. Remind me to tell you about them some day. See that brick? Wordsworth was once sick on that brick. Great man.â
All that had been about ten years ago.
Richard glanced around the great dining hall to see what had changed in the time, and the answer was, of course, absolutely nothing. In the dark heights, dimly seen by the flickering candlelight, were the ghostly portraits of prime ministers, archbishops, political reformers and poets, any of whom might, in their day, have been sick on that same brick.
âWell,âsaidReg, in a loudly confidential whisper, asif introducing the subject of nipple-piercing in a nunnery, âI hear youâve suddenly done very well for yourself, at last, hmmm?â
âEr, well, yes, in fact,â said Richard, who was as surprised at the fact as anybody else, âyes, I have.â
Around the table several gazes stiffened on him.
âComputers,â he heard somebody whisper dismissively to a neighbour further down the table. The stiff gazes relaxed again, and turned away.âExcellent,â said Reg. âIâm so pleased for you, so pleased.â
âTell me,â he went on, and it was a moment before Richard realised that the Professor wasnât talking to him any more, but had turned to the right to address his other neighbour, âwhatâs all this about, this,â he flourished a vague hand over the candles and college silver, â...stuff?â
His neighbour, an elderly wizened figure, turned very slowly and looked at him as if he was rather annoyed at being raised from the dead like this.
âColeridge,â he said in a thin rasp, âitâs the Coleridge Dinner you old fool.â He turned very slowly back until he was facing the front again. His name was Cawley, he was a Professor of Archaeology and Anthropology, and it was

frequently said of him, behind his back, that he regarded it not so much as a serious academic study, more as a chance to relive his childhood.
âAh, is it,â murmured Reg, âis it?â and turned back to Richard. âItâs the Coleridge Dinner,â he said knowledgeably. âColeridge was a member of the college, you know,â he added after a moment. âColeridge. Samuel Taylor. Poet. I expect youâve heard of him. This is his Dinner. Well, not literally, of course. It would be cold by now.â Silence. âHere, have some salt.â
âEr, thank you, I think Iâll wait,â said Richard, surprised. There was no food on the table yet.
âGo on, take it,â insisted the Professor, proffering him the heavy silver salt cellar.
Richard blinked in bemusement but with an interior shrug he reached to take it. In the moment that he blinked, however, the salt cellar had completely vanished.
He started back in surprise.
âGood one, eh?â said Reg as he retrieved the missing cruet from behind the ear of his deathly right-hand neighbour, provoking a surprisingly girlish giggle from somewhere else at the table. Reg smiled impishly. âVery irritating habit, I know. Itâs next on my list for giving up after smoking and leeches.â
Well, that was another thing that hadnât changed. Some people pick their noses, others habitually beat up old ladies on the streets. Regâs vice was a harmless if peculiar one -- an addiction to childish conjuring tricks. Richard remembered the first time he had been to see Reg with a problem -- it was only the normal Angst that periodically takes undergraduates into its grip, particularly when they have essays to write, but it had seemed a dark and savage weight at the time. Reg had sat and listened to his outpourings with adeep frown of concentration, and when at last Richard had finished, he pondered seriously, stroked his chin a lot, and at last leaned forward and looked him in the eye.

âI suspect that your problem,â he said, âis that you have too many paper clips up your nose.â
Richard stared at him.
âAllow me to demonstrate,â said Reg, and leaning across the desk he pulled from Richardâs nose a chain of eleven paper clips and a small rubber swan.
âAh, the real culprit,â he said, holding up the swan. âThey come in cereal packets, you know, and cause no end of trouble. Well, Iâm glad weâve had this little chat, my dear fellow. Please feel free to disturb me again if you have any more such problems.â
Needless to say, Richard didnât.
Richard glanced around the table to see if there was anybody else he recognised from his time at the college.
Two places away to the left was the don who had been Richardâs Director of Studies in English, who showed no signs of recognising him at all. This was hardly surprising since Richard had spent his three years here assiduously avoiding him, often to the extent of growing a beard and pretending to be someone else.
Next to him was a man whom Richard had never managed to identify. Neither, in fact, had anyone else. He was thin and vole-like and had the most extraordinarily long bony nose -- it really was very, very long and bony indeed. In fact it looked a lot like the controversial keel which had helped the Australians win the Americaâs Cup in 1983, and this resemblance had been much remarked upon at the time, though not of course to his face. No one had said anything to his face at all.No one.
Ever.
Anyone meeting him forthe first time was too startled and embarrassed by his nose to speak, and the second time was worse because of the first time, and

so on. Years had gone by now, seventeen in all. In all that time he had been cocooned in silence. In hall it had long been the habit of the college servants to position a separate set of salt, pepper and mustard on either side of him, since no one could ask him to pass them, and to ask someone sitting on the other side of him was not only rude but completely impossible because of his nose being in the way.
The other odd thing about him was a series of gestures he made and repeated regularly throughout every evening. They consisted of tapping each of the fingers of his left hand in order, and then one of the fingers of his right hand. He would then occasionally tap some other part of his body, a knuckle, an elbow or a knee. Whenever he was forced to stop this by the requirements of eating he would start blinking each of his eyes instead, and occasionally nodding. No one, of course, had ever dared to ask him why he did this, though all were consumed with curiosity.
Richard couldnât see who was sitting beyond him.
In the other direction, beyond Regâs deathly neighbour, was Watkin, the Classics Professor, a man of terrifying dryness and oddity. His heavy rimless glasses were almost solid cubes of glass within which his eyes appeared to lead independent existences like goldfish. His nose was straight enough and ordinary, but beneath it he wore the same beard as Clint Eastwood. His eyes gazed swimmingly around the table as he selected who was going to be spoken at tonight. He had thought that his prey might be one of the guests, the newly appointed Head of Radio Three, who was sitting opposite -- but unfortunately he had already been ensnared by the Music Director of the college and a Professor of Philosophy. These two were busy explaining to the harassed man that the phrase âtoo much Mozartâ was, given any reasonable definition of those three words, an inherently self-contradictory expression, and that any sentence which contained such a phrase would be thereby rendered meaningless and could not, consequently, be advanced as part of an argument in favour of any given programme-scheduling strategy. The poor man was already beginning to grip his cutlery too tightly. His eyes darted about desperately looking for rescue, and made the mistake of lighting on those of Watkin.

âGood evening,â said Watkin with smiling charm, nodding in the most friendly way, and then letting his gaze settle glassily on to his bowl of newly arrived soup, from which position it would not allow itself to be moved. Yet. Let the bugger suffer a little. He wanted the rescue to be worth at least a good half dozen radio talk fees.
Beyond Watkin, Richard suddenly discovered the source of the little girlish giggle that had greeted Regâs conjuring trick. Astonishingly enough it was a little girl. She was about eight years old with blonde hair and a glum look. She was sitting occasionally kicking pettishly at the table leg.
âWhoâs that?â Richard asked Reg in surprise. âWhoâs what?â Reg asked Richard in surprise.
Richard inclined a finger surreptitiously in her direction. âThe girl,â he whispered, âthe very, very little girl. Is it some new maths professor?â
Reg peered round at her. âDo you know,â he said in astonishment, âI havenâtthe faintest idea. Neverknown anythinglike it. How extraordinary.â
At that moment the problem was solved by the man from the BBC, who suddenly wrenched himself out of the logical half-nelson into which his neighbours had got him, and told the girl off for kicking the table. She stopped kicking the table, and instead kicked the air with redoubled vigour. He told her to try and enjoy herself, so she kicked him. This did something to bring a brief glimmer of pleasure into her glum evening, but it didnât last. Her father briefly shared with the table at large his feelings about baby-sitters who let people down, but nobody felt able to run with the topic.
âA major season of Buxtehude,â resumed the Director of Music, âis of course clearly long overdue. Iâm sure youâll be looking forward to remedying this situation at the first opportunity.â
âOh, er, yes,â replied the girlâs father, spilling his soup, âer, that is... heâs not the same one as Gluck, is he?â

The little girl kicked the table leg again. When her father looked sternly at her, she put her head on one side and mouthed a question at him.
âNot now,â he insisted at her as quietly as he could.
âWhen, then?â
âLater. Maybe. Later, weâll see.â
She hunched grumpily back in her seat. âYou always say later,â she mouthed at him.
âPoor child,â murmured Reg. âThere isnât a don at this table who doesnât behave exactly like that inside. Ah, thank you.â Their soup arrived, distracting his attention, and Richardâs.
âSo tell me,â said Reg, after they had both had a couple of spoonsful and arrived independently at the same conclusion, that it was not a taste explosion, âwhat youâve been up to, my dear chap. Something to do with computers, I understand, and also to do with music. I thought you read English when you were here -- though only, I realise, in your spare time.â He looked at Richard significantly over the rim of his soup spoon. âNow wait,â he interrupted before Richard even had a chance to start, âdonât I vaguely remember that you had some sort of computer when you were here? When was it? 1977?â
âWell, what we called a computer in 1977 was really a kind of electric abacus, but...â
âOh, now, donât underestimate the abacus,â said Reg. âIn skilled hands itâs a very sophisticated calculating device. Furthermore it requires no power, can be made with any materials you have to hand, and never goes bing in the middle of an important piece of work.â
âSo an electric one would be particularly pointless,â said Richard.âTrue enough,â conceded Reg.
âThere really wasnât a lot this machine could do that you couldnât do yourself

in half the time with a lot less trouble,â said Richard, âbut it was, on the other hand, very good at being a slow and dim-witted pupil.â
Reg looked at him quizzically.
âI had no idea they were supposed to be in short supply,â he said. âI could hit a dozen with a bread roll from where Iâm sitting.â
âIâm sure. But look at it this way. What really is the point of trying to teach anything to anybody?â
This question seemed to provoke a murmur of sympathetic approval from up and down the table.
Richard continued, âWhat I mean is that if you really want to understand something, the best way is to try and explain it to someone else. That forces you to sort it out in your own mind. And the more slow and dim-witted your pupil, the more you have to break things down into more and more simple ideas. And thatâs really the essence of programming. By the time youâve sorted out a complicated idea into little steps that even a stupid machine can deal with, youâve certainly learned something about it yourself. The teacher usually learns more than the pupil. Isnât that true?â
âIt would be hard to learn much less than my pupils,â came a low growl from somewhere on the table, âwithout undergoing a pre-frontal lobotomy.â
âSo I used to spend days struggling to write essays on this 16K machine that would have taken a couple of hours on a typewriter, but what was fascinating to me was the process of trying to explain to the machine what it was I wanted it to do. I virtually wrote my own word processor in BASIC. A simple search and replace routine would take about three hours.â
âI forget, did you ever get any essays done at all?â
âWell, not as such. No actual essays, but the reasons why not were absolutely fascinating. For instance, I discovered that...â

He broke off, laughing at himself.
âI was also playing keyboards in a rock group, of course,â he added. âThat didnât help.â
âNow, that I didnât know,â said Reg. âYour past has murkier things in it than I dreamed possible. A quality, I might add, that it shares with this soup.â He wiped his mouth with his napkin very carefully. âI must go and have a word with the kitchen staff one day. I would like to be sure that they are keeping the right bits and throwing the proper bits away. So. A rock group, you say. Well, well, well. Good heavens.ââYes,â said Richard. âWe called ourselves The Reasonably Good Band, but in fact we werenât. Our intention was to be the Beatles of the early eighties, but we got much better financial and legal advice than the Beatles ever did, which was basically âDonât botherâ, so we didnât. I left Cambridge and starved for three years.â
âBut didnât I bump into you during that period,â said Reg, âand you said you were doing very well?â
âAs a road sweeper, yes. There was an awful lot of mess on the roads. More than enough, I felt, to support an entire career. However, I got the sack for sweeping the mess on to another sweeperâs patch.â
Reg shook his head. âThe wrong career for you, Iâm sure. There are plentyofvocations wheresuchbehaviour would ensurerapid preferment.â
âI tried a few -- none of them much grander, though. And I kept none of them very long, because I was always too tired to do them properly. Iâd be found asleep slumped over the chicken sheds or filing cabinets - - depending on what the job was. Been up all night with the computer you see, teaching it to play âThree Blind Miceâ. It was an important goal for me.â
âIâm sure,â agreed Reg. âThank you,â he said to the college servant who took his half-finished plate of soup from him, âthank you very much. âThree Blind Miceâ, eh? Good. Good. So no doubt you succeeded eventually, and this accounts for your present celebrated status. Yes?ââWell, thereâs a bit more to it than that.â

âI feared there might be. Pity you didnât bring it with you though. It might have cheered up the poor young lady who is currently having our dull and crusty company forced upon her. A swift burst of âThree Blind Miceâ would probably do much to revive her spirits.â He leaned forward to look past his two right-hand neighbours at the girl, who was still sitting sagging in her chair.
âHello,â he said.
She looked up in surprise, and then dropped her eyes shyly, swinging her legs again.
âWhich do you think is worse,â enquired Reg, âthe soup or the company?â She gave a tiny, reluctant laugh and shrugged, still looking down.
âI think youâre wise not to commit yourself at this stage,â continued Reg. âMyself, Iâm waiting to see the carrots before I make any judgements. Theyâve been boiling them since the weekend, but I fear it may not be enough. The only thing that could possibly be worse than the carrots is Watkin. Heâs the man with the silly glasses sitting between us. My nameâs Reg, by the way. Come over and kick me when you have a moment.â The girl giggled and glanced up at Watkin, who stiffened and made an appallingly unsuccessful attempt to smile good-naturedly.
âWell, little girl,â he said to her awkwardly, and she had desperately to suppress a hoot of laughter at his glasses. Little conversation therefore ensued, but the girl had an ally, and began to enjoy herself a tiny little bit. Her father gave her a relieved smile.Reg turned back to Richard, who said, suddenly, âDo you have any family?â
âEr... no,â said Reg, quietly. âBut tell me. After âThree Blind Miceâ, what then?â
âWell, to cut a long story short, Reg, I ended up working for WayForward Technologies...â

âAh, yes, the famous Mr Way. Tell me, whatâs he like?â
Richard was always faintly annoyed by this question, probably because he was asked it so often.
âBoth better and worse than heâs represented in the press. I like him a lot, actually. Like any driven man he can be a bit trying at times, but Iâve known him since the very early days of the company when neither he nor I had a bean to our names. Heâs fine. Itâs just that itâs a good idea not to let him have your phone number unless you possess an industrial-grade answering machine.ââWhat? Whyâs that?â
âWell, heâs one of those people who can only think when heâs talking. When he has ideas, he has to talk them out to whoever will listen. Or, if the people themselves are not available, which is increasingly the case, their answering machines will do just as well. He just phones them up and talks at them. He has one secretary whose sole job is to collect tapes from people he might have phoned, transcribe them, sort them and give him the edited text the next day in a blue folder.â
âA blue one, eh?â
âAsk me why he doesnât simply use a tape recorder,â said Richard with a shrug.
Reg considered this. âI expect he doesnât use a tape recorder because he doesnât like talking to himself,â he said. âThere is a logic there. Of a kind.â
He took a mouthful of his newly arrived porc au poivre and ruminated on it for a while before gently laying his knife and fork aside again for the moment.
âSo what,â he said at last, âis the role of young MacDuff in all this?â
âWell, Gordon assigned me to write a major piece of software for the Apple Macintosh. Financial spreadsheet, accounting, that sort of thing, powerful, easy to use, lots of graphics. I asked him exactly what he wanted in it, and he just

said, âEverything. I want the top piece of all-singing, all-dancing business software for that machine.â And being of a slightly whimsical turn of mind I took him literally.
âYou see, a pattern of numbers can represent anything you like, can be used to map any surface, or modulate any dynamic process -- and so on. And any set of company accounts are, in the end, just a pattern of numbers. So I sat down and wrote a program thatâll take those numbers and do what you like with them. If you just want a bar graph itâll do them as a bar graph, if you want them as a pie chart or scatter graph itâll do them as a pie chart or scatter graph. If you want dancing girls jumping out of the pie chart in order to distract attention from the figures the pie chart actually represents, then the program will do that as well. Or you can turn your figures into, for instance, a flock of seagulls, and the formation they fly in and the way in which the wings of each gull beat will be determined by the performance of each division of your company. Great for producing animated corporate logos that actually mean something.
âBut the silliest feature of all was that if you wanted your company accounts represented as a piece of music, it could do that as well. Well, I thought it was silly. The corporate world went bananas over it.â
Reg regarded him solemnly from over a piece of carrot poised delicately on his fork in front of him, but did not interrupt.
âYou see, any aspect of a piece of music can be expressed as a sequence or pattern of numbers,â enthused Richard. âNumbers can express the pitch of notes, the length of notes, patterns of pitches and lengths.â
âYou mean tunes,â said Reg. The carrot had not moved yet. Richard grinned.
âTunes would be a very good word for it. I must remember that.â
âIt would help you speak more easily.â Reg returned the carrot to his plate, untasted. âAnd this software did well, then?â he asked.

âNot so much here. The yearly accounts of most British companies emerged sounding like the Dead March from Saul, but in Japan they went for it like a pack of rats. It produced lots of cheery company anthems that started well,
but if you were going to criticise youâd probably say that they tended to get a bit loud and squeaky at the end. Did spectacular business in the States, which was the main thing, commercially. Though the thing thatâs interesting me most now is what happens if you leave the accounts out of it. Turn the numbers that represent the way a swallowâs wings beat directly into music. What would you hear? Not the sound of cash registers, according to Gordon.ââFascinating,â said Reg, âquite fascinating,â and popped the carrot at last into his mouth. He turned and leaned forward to speak to his new girlfriend.
âWatkin loses,â he pronounced. âThe carrots have achieved a new all-time low. Sorry, Watkin, but awful as you are, the carrots, Iâm afraid, are world-beaters.â
The girl giggled more easily than last time and she smiled at him. Watkin was trying to take all this good-naturedly, but it was clear as his eyes swam at Reg that he was more used to discomfiting than being discomfited.
âPlease,Daddy, can I now?âWith her new-found, if slight, confidence, the girl had also found a voice.
âLater,â insisted her father.
âThis is already later. Iâve been timing it.â
âWell...â He hesitated, and was lost.
âWeâve been to Greece,â announced the girl in a small but awed voice.
âAh, have you indeed,â said Watkin, with a little nod. âWell, well. Anywhere in particular, or just Greece generally?â
âPatmos,â she said decisively. âIt was beautiful. I think Patmos is the most beautiful place in the whole world. Except the ferry never came when it said

it would. Never, ever. I timed it. We missed our flight but I didnât mind.â
âAh, Patmos, I see,â said Watkin, who was clearly roused by the news. âWell, what you have to understand, young lady, is that the Greeks, not content with dominating the culture of the Classical world, are also responsible for the greatest, some would say the only, work of true creative imagination produced this century as well. I refer of course to the Greek ferry timetables. A work of the sublimest fiction. Anyone who has travelled in the Aegean will confirm this. Hmm, yes. I think so.â
She frowned at him.
âI found a pot,â she said.
âProbably nothing,â interrupted her father hastily. âYou know the way it is. Everyone who goes to Greece for the first time thinks theyâve found a pot, donât they? Ha, ha.â
There were general nods. This was true. Irritating, but true.
âI found it in the harbour,â she said, âin the water. While we were waiting for the damn ferry.â
âSarah! Iâve told you...â
âItâs just what you called it. And worse. You called it words I didnât think you knew. Anyway, I thought that if everyone here was meant to be so clever, then someone would be able to tell me if it was a proper ancient Greek thing or not. I think itâs very old. Will you please let them see it, Daddy?â
Her father shrugged hopelessly and started to fish about under his chair.
âDid you know, young lady,â said Watkin to her, âthat the Book of Revelation was written on Patmos? It was indeed. By Saint John the Divine, as you know. To me it shows very clear signs of having been written while waiting for a ferry. Oh, yes, I think so. It starts off, doesnât it, with that kind of dreaminess you get when youâre killing time, getting bored, you know, just

making things up, and then gradually grows to a sort of climax of hallucinatory despair. I find that very suggestive. Perhaps you should write a paper on it.â He nodded at her.
She looked at him as if he were mad.
âWell, here it is,â said her father, plonking the thing down on the table. âJust a pot, as you see. Sheâs only six,â he added with a grim smile, âarenât you, dear?â
âSeven,â said Sarah.
The pot was quite small, about five inches high and four inches across at its widest point. The body was almost spherical, with a very narrow neck extending about an inch above the body. The neck and about half of the surface area were encrusted with hard-caked earth, but the parts of the pot that could be seen were of a rough, ruddy texture.
Sarah took it and thrust it into the hands of the don sitting on her right. âYou look clever,â she said. âTell me what you think.â
The don took it, and turned it over with a slightly supercilious air. âIâm sure if you scraped away the mud from the bottom,â he remarked wittily, âit would probably say âMade in Birminghamâ.â
âThat old, eh?â said Sarahâs father with a forced laugh. âLong time since anything was made there.â
âAnyway,â said the don, ânot my field, Iâm a molecular biologist. Anyone else want to have a look?â
This question was not greeted with wild yelps of enthusiasm, but nevertheless the pot was passed from hand to hand around the far end of the table in a desultory fashion. It was goggled at through pebble glasses, peered at through horn-rims, gazed at over half-moons, and squinted at by someone who had left his glasses in his other suit, which he very much feared had now gone to the cleanerâs. No one seemed to know how old it was, or to care very

much. The young girlâs face began to grow downhearted again.
âSour lot,â said Reg to Richard. He picked up a silver salt cellar again and held it up.
âYoung lady,â he said, leaning forward to address her.
âOh, not again, you old fool,â muttered the aged archaeologist Cawley, sitting back and putting his hands over his ears.
âYoung lady,â repeated Reg, âregard this simple silver salt cellar. Regard this simple hat.â
âYou havenât got a hat,â said the girl sulkily.
âOh,â said Reg, âa moment please,â and he went and fetched his woolly red one.
âRegard,â he said again, âthis simple silver salt cellar. Regard this simple woolly hat. I put the salt cellar in the hat, thus, and I pass the hat to you. The next part of the trick, dear lady... is up to you.â
He handed the hat to her, past their two intervening neighbours, Cawley and Watkin. She took the hat and looked inside it.
âWhereâs it gone?â she asked, staring into the hat.
âItâs wherever you put it,â said Reg.
âOh,â said Sarah, âI see. Well... that wasnât very good.â
Reg shrugged. âA humble trick, but it gives me pleasure,â he said, and turned back to Richard. âNow, what were we talking about?â
Richard looked at him with a slight sense of shock. He knew that the Professor had always been prone to sudden and erratic mood swings, but it was as if all the warmth had drained out of him in an instant. He now wore the same

distracted expression Richard had seen on his face when first he had arrived at his door that evening, apparently completely unexpected. Reg seemed then to sense that Richard was taken aback and quickly reassembled a smile.
âMy dear chap!â he said. âMy dear chap! My dear, dear chap! What was I saying?â
âEr, you were saying âMy dear chapâ.â
âYes, but I feel sure it was a prelude to something. A sort of short toccata on the theme of what a splendid fellow you are prior to introducing the main subject of my discourse, the nature of which I currently forget. You have no idea what I was about to say?â
âNo.â
âOh. Well, I suppose I should be pleased. If everyone knew exactly what I was going to say, then there would be no point in my saying it, would there? Now, howâs our young guestâs pot doing?â
In fact it had reached Watkin, who pronounced himself no expert on what the ancients had made for themselves to drink out of, only on what they had written as a result. He said that Cawley was the one to whose knowledge and experience they should all bow, and attempted to give the pot to him.
âI said,â he repeated, âyours was the knowledge and experience to which we should bow. Oh, for heavenâs sake, take your hands off your ears and have a look at the thing.â
Gently, but firmly, he drew Cawleyâs right hand from his ear, explained the situation to him once again, and handed him the pot. Cawley gave it a cursory but clearly expert examination.
âYes,â he said, âabout two hundred years old, I would think. Very rough. Very crude example of its type. Utterly without value, of course.â
He put it down peremptorily and gazed off into the old minstrel gallery,

which appeared to anger him for some reason.
The effect on Sarah was immediate. Already discouraged, she was thoroughly downcast by this. She bit her lip and threw herself back against her chair, feeling once again thoroughly out of place and childish. Her father gave her a warning look about misbehaving, and then apologised for her again.
âWell, Buxtehude,â he hurried on to say, âyes, good old Buxtehude. Weâll have to see what we can do. Tell me...â
âYoung lady,â interrupted a voice, hoarse with astonishment, âyou are clearly a magician and enchantress of prodigious powers!â
All eyes turned to Reg, the old show-off. He was gripping the pot and staring at it with manic fascination. He turned his eyes slowly to the little girl, as if for the first time assessing the power of a feared adversary.
âI bow to you,â he whispered. âI, unworthy though I am to speak in the presence of such a power as yours, beg leave to congratulate you on one of the finest feats of the conjurerâs art it has been my privilege to witness!â
Sarah stared at him with widening eyes.
âMay I show these people what you have wrought?â he asked earnestly.Very faintly she nodded, and he fetched her formerly precious, but now sadly discredited, pot a sharp rap on the table.
It split into two irregular parts, the caked clay with which it was surrounded falling in jagged shards on the table. One side of the pot fell away, leaving the rest standing.
Sarahâs eyes goggled at the stained and tarnished but clearly recognisable silver college salt cellar, standing jammed in the remains of the pot.
âStupid old fool,â muttered Cawley.

After the general disparagement and condemnation of this cheap parlour trick had died down -- none of which could dim the awe in Sarahâs eyes -- Reg turned to Richard and said, idly:
âWho was that friend of yours when you were here, do you ever see him? Chap with an odd East European name. Svlad something. Svlad Cjelli. Remember the fellow?â
Richard looked at him blankly for a moment.
âSvlad?â he said. âOh, you mean Dirk. Dirk Cjelli. No. I never stayed in touch. Iâve bumped into him a couple of times in the street but thatâs all. I think he changes his name from time to time. Why do you ask?â
CHAPTER 5
High on his rocky promontory the Electric Monk continued to sit on a horse which was going quietly and uncomplainingly spare. From under its rough woven cowl the Monk gazed unblinkingly down into the valley, with which it was having a problem, but the problem was a new and hideous one to the Monk, for it was this -- Doubt.
He never suffered it for long, but when he did, it gnawed at the very root of his being.
The day was hot; the sun stood in an empty hazy sky and beat down upon the grey rocks and the scrubby, parched grass. Nothing moved, not even the Monk. But strange things were beginning to fizz in its brain, as they did from time to time when a piece of data became misaddressed as it passed through its input buffer.
But then the Monk began to believe, fitfully and nervously at first, but then with a great searing white flame of belief which overturned all previous beliefs, including the stupid one about the valley being pink, that somewhere

down in the valley, about a mile from where he was sitting, there would shortly open up a mysterious doorway into a strange and distant world, a doorway through which he might enter. An astounding idea.
Astoundingly enough, however, on this one occasion he was perfectly right. The horse sensed that something was up.
It pricked up its ears and gently shook its head. It had gone into a sort of trance looking at the same clump of rocks for so long, and was on the verge of imagining them to be pink itself. It shook its head a little harder.
A slight twitch on the reins, and a prod from the Monkâs heels and they were off, picking their way carefully down the rocky incline. The way was difficult. Much of it was loose shale -- loose brown and grey shale, with the occasional brown and green plant clinging to a precariousexistenceon it.TheMonknoticedthiswithout embarrassment. It was an older, wiser Monk now, and had put childish things behind it. Pink valleys, hermaphrodite tables, these were all natural stages through which one had to pass on the path to true enlightenment.
The sun beat hard on them. The Monk wiped the sweat and dust off its face and paused, leaning forward on the horseâs neck. It peered down through the shimmering heat haze at a large outcrop of rock which stood out on to the floor of the valley. There, behind that outcrop, was where the Monk thought, or rather passionately believed to the core of its being, the door would appear. It tried to focus more closely, but the details of the view swam confusingly in the hot rising air.
As it sat back in its saddle, and was about to prod the horse onward, it suddenly noticed a rather odd thing.
On a flattish wall of rock nearby, in fact so nearby that the Monk was surprised not to have noticed it before, was a large painting. The painting was crudely drawn, though not without a certain stylish sweep of line, and seemed very old, possibly very, very old indeed. The paint was faded, chipped and patchy, and it was difficult to discern with any clarity what the picture was. The Monk

approached the picture more closely. It looked like a primitive hunting scene.
The group of purple, multi-limbed creatures were clearly early hunters. They carried rough spears, and were in hot pursuit of a large horned and armoured creature, which appeared to have been wounded in the hunt already. The colours were now so dim as to be almost non-existent. In fact, all that could be clearly seen was the white of the huntersâ teeth, which seemed to shine with a whiteness whose lustre was undimmed by the passage of what must have been many thousands of years. In fact they even put the Monkâs own teeth to shame, and he had cleaned them only that morning.
The Monk had seen paintings like this before, but only in pictures or on the TV, never in real life. They were usually to be found in caves where they were protected from the elements, otherwise they would not have survived.
The Monk looked more carefully at the immediate environs of the rock wall andnoticed that, though not exactly ina cave, it was nevertheless protected by a large overhang and was well sheltered from the wind and rain. Odd, though, that it should have managed to last so long. Odder still that it should appear not to have been discovered. Such cave paintings as there were were all famous and familiar images, but this was not one that he had ever seen before.
Perhaps this was a dramatic and historic find he had made. Perhaps if he were to return to the city and announce this discovery he would be welcomed back, given a new motherboard after all and allowed to believe -- to believe -- believe what? He paused, blinked, and shook his head to clear a momentary system error.
He pulled himself up short.
He believed in a door. He must find that door. The door was the way to... to... The Door was The Way.
Good.

Capital letters were always the best way of dealing with things you didnât have a good answer to.
Brusquely he tugged the horseâs head round and urged it onward and downward. Within a few minutes more of tricky manoeuvring they had reached the valley floor, and he was momentarily disconcerted to discover that the fine top layer of dust that had settled on the brown parched earth was indeed a very pale brownish pink, particularly on the banks of the sluggish trickle of mud which was all that remained, in the hot season, of the river that flowed through the valley when the rains came. He dismounted and bent down to feel the pink dust and run it through his fingers. It was very fine and soft and felt pleasant as he rubbed it on his skin. It was about the same colour, perhaps a little paler.
The horse was looking at him. He realised, a little belatedly perhaps, that the horse must be extremely thirsty. He was extremely thirsty himself, but had tried to keep his mind off it. He unbuckled the water flask from the saddle. It was pathetically light. He unscrewed the top and took one single swig. Then he poured a little into his cupped hand and offered it to the horse, who slurped at it greedily and briefly.
The horse looked at him again.
The Monk shook his head sadly, resealed the bottle and replaced it. He knew, in that small part of his mind where he kept factual and logical information, that it would not last much longer, and that, without it, neither would they. It was only his Belief that kept him going, currently his Belief in The Door.
He brushed the pink dust from his rough habit, and then stood looking at the rocky outcrop, a mere hundred yards distant. He looked at it not without a slight, tiny trepidation. Although the major part of his mind was firm in its eternal and unshakeable Belief that there would be a Door behind the outcrop, and that the Door would be The Way, yet the tiny part of his brain that understood about the water bottle could not help but recall past disappointments and sounded a very tiny but jarring note of caution.
If he elected not to go and see The Door for himself, then he could continue to

believe in it forever. It would be the lodestone of his life (what little was left of it, said the part of his brain that knew about the water bottle).
If on the other hand he went to pay his respects to the Door and it wasnât there... what then?
The horse whinnied impatiently.
The answer, of course, was very simple. He had a whole board of circuits for dealing with exactly this problem, in fact this was the very heart of his function. He would continue to believe in it whatever the facts turned out to be, what else was the meaning of Belief?
The Door would still be there, even if the door was not.
He pulled himself together. The Door would be there, and he must now go to it, because The Door was The Way.
Instead of remounting his horse, he led it. The Way was but a short way, and he should enter the presence of the Door in humility.
He walked, brave and erect, with solemn slowness. He approached the rocky outcrop. He reached it. He turned the corner. He looked.
The Door was there.
The horse, it must be said, was quite surprised.
The Monk fell to his knees in awe and bewilderment. So braced was he for dealing with the disappointment that was habitually his lot that, though he would never know to admit it, he was completely unprepared for this. He stared at The Door in sheer, blank system error.
It was a door such as he had never seen before. All the doors he knew were great steel-reinforced things, because of all the video recorders and dishwashers that were kept behind them, plus of course all the expensive Electric Monks that were needed to believe in it all. This one was simple,

wooden and small, about his own size. A Monk-size door, painted white, with a single, slightly dented brass knob slightly less than halfway up one side. It was set simply in the rock face, with no explanation as to its origin or purpose.
Hardly knowing how he dared, the poor startled Monk staggered to his feet
and, leading his horse, walked nervously forward towards it. He reached out and touched it. He was so startled when no alarms went off that he jumped back. He touched it again, more firmly this time.
He let his hand drop slowly to the handle -- again, no alarms. He waited to be sure, and then he turned it, very, very gently. He felt a mechanism release. He held his breath. Nothing. He drew the door towards him, and it came easily. He looked inside, but the interior was so dim in contrast with the desert sun outside that he could see nothing. At last, almost dead with wonder, he entered, pulling the horse in after him.
A few minutes later, a figure that had been sitting out of sight around the next outcrop of rock finished rubbing dust on his face, stood up, stretched his limbs and made his way back towards the door, patting his clothes as he did so.
CHAPTER 6
âIn Xanadu did Kubla Khan
A stately pleasure-dome decree:â
The reader clearly belonged to the school of thought which holds that a sense of the seriousness or greatness of a poem is best imparted by reading it in a silly voice. He soared and swooped at the words until they seemed to duck and run for cover.
âWhere Alph, the sacred river ran Through caverns measureless to man

Down to a sunless sea.â
Richard relaxed back into his seat. The words were very, very familiar to him, as they could not help but be to any English graduate of St Ceddâs College, and they settled easily into his mind.
The association of the college with Coleridge was taken very seriously indeed, despite the manâs well-known predilection for certain recreational pharmaceuticals under the influence of which this, his greatest work, was composed, in a dream.
The entire manuscript was lodged in the safe-keeping of the college library, and it was from this itself, on the regular occasion of the Coleridge Dinner, that the poem was read.
âSo twice five miles of fertile ground
With walls and towers were girdled round:
And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills, Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree; And here were forests ancient as the hills, Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.â
Richard wondered how long it took. He glanced sideways at his former Director of Studies and was disturbed by the sturdy purposefulness of his reading posture. The singsong voice irritated him at first, but after a while it began to lull him instead, and he watched a rivulet of wax seeping over the edge of a candle that was burning low now and throwing a guttering light over the carnage of dinner.
âBut oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted

Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover! A savage place! as holy and enchanted
As eâer beneath a waning moon was haunted By woman wailing for her demon-lover!â
The small quantities of claret that he had allowed himself during the course of the meal seeped warmly through his veins, and soon his own mind began to wander, and provoked by Regâs question earlier in the meal, he wondered what had lately become of his former... was friend the word? He seemed more like a succession of extraordinary events than a person. The idea of him actually having friends as such seemed not so much unlikely, more a sort of mismatching of concepts, like the idea of the Suez crisis popping out for a bun.
Svlad Cjelli. Popularly known as Dirk, though, again, âpopularâ was hardly right. Notorious, certainly; sought after, endlessly speculated about, those too were true. But popular? Only in the sense that a serious accident on the motorway might be popular -- everyone slows down to have a good look, but no one will get too close to the flames. Infamous was more like it. Svlad Cjelli, infamously known as Dirk.
He was rounder than the average undergraduate and wore more hats. That is to say, there was just the one hat which he habitually wore, but he wore it with a passion that was rare in one so young. The hat was dark red and round, with a very flat brim, and it appeared to move as if balanced on gimbals, which ensured its perfect horizontality at all times, however its owner moved his head. As a hat it was a remarkableratherthanentirelysuccessful pieceof persona! decoration. It would make an elegant adornment, stylish, shapely and flattering, if the wearer were a small bedside lamp, but not otherwise.People gravitated around him, drawn in by the stories he denied about himself, but what the source of these stories might be, if not his own denials, was never entirely clear.
The tales had to do with the psychic powers that heâd supposedly inherited from his motherâs side of the family who he claimed, had lived at the

smarter end of Transylvania. That is to say, he didnât make any such claim at all, and said it was the most absurd nonsense. He strenuously denied that
there were bats of any kind at all in his family and threatened to sue
anybody who put about such malicious fabrications, but he affected nevertheless to wear a large and flappy leather coat, and had one of those machines in his room which are supposed to help cure bad backs if you hang upside down from them. He would allow people to discover him hanging from this machine at all kinds of odd hours of the day, and more particularly of the night, expressly so that he could vigorously deny that it had any significance whatsoever.
By means of an ingenious series of strategically deployed denials of the most exciting and exotic things, he was able to create the myth thathewasa psychic, mystic,telepathic, fey, clairvoyant, psychosassic vampire bat.
What did âpsychosassicâ mean?
It was his own word and he vigorously denied that it meant anything at all. âAnd from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,
As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,
A mighty fountain momently was forced:
Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst
Huge fragments vaulted...â
Dirk had also been perpetually broke. This would change.
It was his room-mate who started it, a credulous fellow called Mander, who, if the truth were known, had probably been specially selected by Dirk for his credulity.
Steve Mander noticed that if ever Dirk went to bed drunk he would talk in his sleep. Not only that, but the sort of things he would say in his sleep would be

things like, âThe opening up of trade routes to the mumble mumble burble was the turning point for the growth of empire in the snore footle mumble. Discuss.â
â...like rebounding hail,
Or chaffy grain beneath the thresherâs flail:â
The first time this happened Steve Mander sat bolt upright in bed. This was shortly before prelim exams in the second year, and what Dirk had just said, or judiciously mumbled, sounded remarkably like a very likely question in the Economic History paper.
Mander quietly got up, crossed over to Dirkâs bed and listened very hard, but other than a few completely disconnected mumblings about Schleswig- Holstein andthe Franco-Prussian war, the latter being largely directed by Dirk into his pillow, he learned nothing more.
News, however, spread -- quietly, discreetly, and like wildfire. âAnd âmid these dancing rocks at once and ever
It flung up momently the sacred river.â
For the next month Dirk found himself being constantly wined and dined in the hope that he would sleep very soundly that night and dream-speak a few more exam questions. Remarkably, it seemed that the better he was fed, and the finer the vintage of the wine he was given to drink, the less he would tend to sleep facing directly into his pillow.
His scheme, therefore, was to exploit his alleged gifts without ever actually claiming to have them. In fact he would react to stories about his supposed powers with open incredulity, even hostility.
âFive miles meandering with a mazy motion Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,

Then reached the caverns measureless to man, And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean:
And âmid this tumult Kubla heard from far Ancestral voices prophesying war!â
Dirk was also, he denied, a clairaudient. He would sometimes hum tunes in his sleep that two weeks later would turn out to be a hit for someone. Not too difficult to organise, really.
In fact, he had always done the bare minimum of research necessary to support these myths. He was lazy, and essentially what he did was allow peopleâs enthusiastic credulity to do the work for him. The laziness was essential -- if his supposed feats of the paranormal had been detailed and accurate, then people might have been suspicious and looked for other explanations. On the other hand, the more vague and ambiguous his âpredictionsâthe more other peopleâs own wishful thinking would close the credibility gap.
Dirk never made much out of it -- at least, he appeared not to. In fact, the benefit to himself, as a student, of being continually wined and dined at other peopleâs expense was more considerable than anyone would expect unless they sat down and worked out the figures.
And, of course, he never claimed -- in fact, he actively denied -- that any of it was even remotely true.
He was therefore well placed to execute a very nice and tasty little scam come the time of finals.
âThe shadow of the dome of pleasure Floated midway on the waves;
Where was heard the mingled measure

From the fountain and the caves.
It was a miracle of rare device,
A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!â
âGood heavens...!â Reg suddenly seemed to awake with a start from the light doze into which he had gently slipped under the influence of the wine and the reading, and glanced about himself with blank surprise, but nothing had changed. Coleridgeâs words sang through a warm and contented silence that had settled on the great hall. After another quick frown, Reg settled back into another doze, but this time a slightly more attentive one.
âA damsel with a dulcimer
In a vision once I saw:
It was an Abyssinian maid,
And on her dulcimer she played, Singing of Mount Abora.â
Dirk allowed himself to be persuaded to make, under hypnosis, a firm prediction about what questions would be set for examination that summer.
He himself first planted the idea by explaining exactly the sort of thing that he would never, under any circumstances, be prepared to do, though in many ways he would like to, just to have the chance to disprove his alleged and strongly disavowed abilities.
And it was on these grounds, carefully prepared, that he eventually agreed -- only because it would once and for all scotch the whole silly --immensely, tediously silly --business. He would makehis predictions by means of automatic writing under proper supervision, and they would then be sealed in an envelope and deposited at the bank until after the exams.

Then they would be opened to see how accurate they had been after the exams.
He was, not surprisingly, offered some pretty hefty bribes from a pretty hefty number of people to let them see the predictions he had written down, but he was absolutely shocked by the idea. That, he said, would be dishonest...
âCould I revive within me
Her symphony and song,
To such a deep delight âtwould win me,
That with music loud and long,
I would build that dome in air,
That sunny dome! Those caves of ice!â
Then, a short time later, Dirk allowed himself to be seen around town wearing something of a vexed and solemn expression. At first he waved aside enquiries as to what it was that was bothering him, but eventually he let slip that his mother was going to have to undergo some extremely expensive dental work which, for reasons that he refused to discuss, would have to be done privately, only there wasnât the money.
From here, the path downward to accepting donations for his motherâs supposed medical expenses in return for quick glances at his written exam predictions proved to be sufficiently steep and well-oiled for him to be able to slip down it with a minimum of fuss.
Then it further transpired that the only dentist who could perform this mysterious dental operation was an East European surgeon now living in Malibu, and it was in consequence necessary to increase the level of donations rather sharply.

He still denied, of course, that his abilities were all that they were cracked up to be, in fact he denied that they existed at all, and insisted that he would never have embarked on the exercise at all if it wasnât to disprove the whole thing - - and also, since other people seemed, at their own risk, to have a faith in his abilities that he himself did not, he was happy to indulge them to the extent of letting them pay for his sainted motherâs operation.
He could only emerge well from this situation. Or so he thought.
âAnd all who heard should see them there, And all should cry, Beware! Beware!
His flashing eyes, his floating hair!â
The exam papers Dirk produced under hypnosis, by means of automatic writing, he had, in fact, pieced together simply by doing the same minimum research that any student taking exams would do, studying previous exam papers, and seeing what, if any, patterns emerged, and making intelligent guesses about what might come up. He was pretty sure of getting (as anyone would be) a strike rate that was sufficiently high to satisfy the credulous, and sufficiently low for the whole exercise to look perfectly innocent.
As indeed it was.
What completely blew him out of the water, and caused a furore which ended with him being driven out of Cambridge in the back of a Black Maria, was the fact that all the exam papers he sold turned out to be the same as the papers that were actually set.
Exactly. Word for word. To the very comma. âWave a circle round him thrice,
And close your eyes with holy dread,

For he on honey-dew hath fed,
And drunk the milk of Paradise...â
And that, apart from a flurry of sensational newspaper reports which exposed him as a fraud, then trumpeted him as the real thing so that they could have another round of exposing him as a fraud again and then trumpeting him as the real thing again, until they got bored and found a nice juicy snooker player to harass instead, was that.
In the years since then, Richard had run into Dirk from time to time and had usually been greeted with that kind of guarded half smile that wants to know if you think it owes you money before it blossoms into one that hopes you will lend it some. Dirkâs regular name changes suggested to Richard that he wasnât alone in being treated like this.
He felt a tug of sadness that someone who had seemed so shiningly alive within the small confines of a university community should have seemed to fade so much in the light of common day. And he wondered at Regâs asking after him like that, suddenly and out of the blue, in what seemed altogether too airy and casual a manner.
He glanced around him again, at his lightly snoring neighbour, Reg; at little Sarah rapt in silent attention; at the deep hall swathed in darkly glimmering light; at the portraits of old prime ministers and poets hung high in the darkness with just the odd glint of candlelight gleaming off their teeth; at the Director of English Studies standing reading in his poetry-reading voice; at the book of âKubla Khanâ that the Director of English Studies held in his hand; and finally, surreptitiously, at his watch. He settled back again.
The voice continued, reading the second, and altogether stranger part of the poem...

CHAPTER 7
This was the evening of the last day of Gordon Wayâs life, and he was wondering if the rain would hold off for the weekend. The forecast had said changeable -- a misty night tonight followed by bright but chilly days on Friday and Saturday with maybe a few scattered showers towards the end of Sunday when everyone would be heading back into town.
Everyone, that is, other than Gordon Way.
The weather forecast hadnât mentioned that, of course, that wasnât the job of the weather forecast, but then his horoscope had been pretty misleading as well. It had mentioned an unusual amount of planetary activity in his sign and had urged him to differentiate between what he thought he wanted and what he actually needed, and suggested that he should tackle emotional or workproblems with determination and complete honesty, but had inexplicably failed to mention that he would be dead before the day was out.
He turned off the motorway near Cambridge and stopped at a small filling station for some petrol, where he sat for a moment, finishing off a call on his car phone.
âOK, look, Iâll call you tomorrow,â he said, âor maybe later tonight. Or call me. I should be at the cottage in half an hour. Yes, I know how important the project is to you. All right, I know how important it is, full stop. You want it, I want it. Of course I do. And Iâm not saying that we wonât continue to
support it. Iâm just saying itâs expensive and we should look at the whole thing with determination and complete honesty. Look, why donât you come out to the cottage, and we can talk it through. OK, yeah, yes, I know. I understand. Well, think about it, Kate. Talk to you later. Bye.â
He hung up and continued to sit in his car for a moment.
It was a large car. It was a large silver-grey Mercedes of the sort that they use in advertisements, and not just advertisements for Mercedes. Gordon Way, brother of Susan, employer of Richard MacDuff, was a rich man, the founder and owner of WayForward Technologies II. WayForward Technologies itself

had of course gone bust, for the usual reason, taking his entire first fortune with it.
Luckily, he had managed to make another one.
The âusual reasonâ was that he had been in the business of computer hardware when every twelve-year-old in the country had suddenly got bored with boxes that went bing. His second fortune had been made in software instead. As a result of two major pieces of software, one of which was Anthem (the other, more profitable one had never seen the light of day), WFT-II was the only British software company that could be mentioned in the same sentence as such major U.S. companies as Microsoft or Lotus. The sentence would probably run along the lines of âWayForward Technologies, unlike such major U.S. companies as Microsoft or Lotus...â but it was a start. WayForward was in there. And he owned it.
He pushed a tape into the slot on the stereo console. It accepted it with a soft and decorous click, and a moment or two later Ravelâs BolÃ©ro floated out of eight perfectly matched speakers with fine-meshed matte-black grilles. The stereo was so smooth and spacious you could almost sense the whole ice- rink. He tapped his fingers lightly on the padded rim of the steering wheel. He gazed at the dashboard. Tasteful illuminated figures and tiny, immaculate lights gazed dimly back at him. After a while he suddenly realised this was a self service station and got out to fill the tank.
This took a minute or two. He stood gripping the filler nozzle, stamping his feet in the cold night air, then walked over to the small grubby kiosk, paid for the petrol, remembered to buy a couple of local maps, and then stood chatting enthusiastically to the cashier for a few minutes about the directions the computer industry was likely to take in the following year, suggesting that parallel processing was going to be the key to really intuitive productivity software, but also strongly doubtingwhetherartificialintelligenceresearch/perse/, particularly artificial intelligence research based on the ProLog language, was really going to produce any serious commercially viable products in the foreseeable future, at least as far as the office desk top environment was concerned, a topic that fascinated the cashier not at all.

âThe man just liked to talk,â he would later tell the police. âMan, I could have walked away to the toilet for ten minutes and he wouldâve told it all to the till. If Iâd been fifteen minutes the till would have walked away too. Yeah, Iâm sure thatâs him,â he would add when shown a picture of Gordon Way. âI only wasnât sure at first because in the picture heâs got his mouth closed.â
âAndyouâre absolutely certain you didnâtsee anything else suspicious?â the policeman insisted. âNothing that struck you as odd in any way at all?â
âNo, like I said, it was just an ordinary customer on an ordinary night, just like any other night.â
The policeman stared athim blankly. âJust for the sake of argument,â he went on to say, âif I were suddenly to do this...â -- he made himself go cross- eyed, stuck his tongue out of the corner of his mouth and danced up and down twisting his fingers in his ears -- âwould anything strike you about that?â
âWell, er, yeah,â said the cashier, backing away nervously. âIâd think youâd gone stark raving mad.â
âGood,â said the policeman, putting his notebook away. âItâs just that different people sometimes have a different idea of what âoddâ means, you see, sir. If last night was an ordinary night just like any other night, then I am a pimple on the bottom of the Marquess of Queensburyâs aunt. We shall be requiring a statement later, sir. Thank you for your time.â
That was all yet to come.
Tonight, Gordon pushed the maps in his pocket and strolled back towards his car. Standing under the lights in the mist it had gathered a finely beaded coat of matte moisture on it, and looked like -- well, it looked like an extremely expensive Mercedes-Benz. Gordon caught himself, just for a millisecond, wishing that he had something like that, but he was now quite adept at fending off that particular line of thought, which only led off in circles and left him feeling depressed and confused.
He patted it in a proprietorial manner, then, walking around it, noticed that

the boot wasnât closed properly and pushed it shut. It closed with a good healthy clunk. Well, that made it all worth it, didnât it? Good healthy clunk like that. Old-fashioned values of quality and workmanship. He thought of a dozen things he had to talk to Susan about and climbed back into the car, pushing the auto-dial code on his phone as soon as the car was prowling back on to the road.
â...so if youâd like to leave a message, Iâll get back to you as soon as possible. Maybe.â
Beep.âOh, Susan, hi, itâs Gordon,â he said, cradling the phone awkwardly on his shoulder. âJust on my way to the cottage. Itâs er, Thursday night, and itâs, er... 8.47. Bit misty on the roads. Listen, I have those people from the States coming over this weekend to thrash out the distribution on Anthem Version 2.00, handling the promotion, all that stuff, and look you know I donât like to ask you this sort of thing, but you know I always do anyway, so here it is.
âI just need to know that Richard is on the case. I mean really on the case. I can ask him, and he says, Oh sure, itâs fine, but half the time -- shit, that lorry had bright lights, none of these bastard lorry drivers ever dips them properly, itâs a wonder I donât end up dead in the ditch, that would be something, wouldnât it, leaving your famous last words on somebodyâs answering machine, thereâs no reason why these lorries shouldnât have automatic light-activated dipper switches. Look, can you make a note for me to tell Susan -- not you, of course, secretary Susan at the office -- to tell her to send a letter from me to that fellow at the Department of the Environment saying we can provide the technology if he can provide the legislation? Itâs for the public good, and anyway he owes me a favour plus whatâs the point in having a CBE if you canât kick a little ass? You can tell Iâve been talking to Americans all week.
âThat reminds me, God, I hope I remembered to pack the shotguns. What is it with these Americans that theyâre always so mad to shoot my rabbits? I bought them some maps in the hope that I can persuade them to go on long healthy walks and take their minds off shooting rabbits. I really feel quite sorry for the creatures. I think I should put one of those signs on my lawn when the Americans are coming, you know, like they have in Beverly Hills, saying

`Armed Responseâ.
âMake a note to Susan, would you please, to get an `Armed Responseâ sign made up with a sharp spike on the bottom at the right height for rabbits to see. Thatâs secretary Susan at the office not you, of course.
âWhere was I?
âOh yes. Richard and Anthem 2.00. Susan, that thing has got to be in beta testing in two weeks. He tells me itâs fine. But every time I see him heâs got a picture of a sofa spinning on his computer screen. He says itâs an important concept, but all I see is furniture. People who want their company accounts to sing to them do not want to buy a revolving sofa. Nor do I think he should be turning the erosion patterns of the Himalayas into a flute quintet at this time.
âAnd as for what Kateâs up to, Susan, well, I canât hide the fact that I get anxious at the salaries and computer time itâs eating up. Important long-term research and development it might be, but there is also the possibility, only a possibility, Iâm saying, but nevertheless a possibility which I think we owe it to ourselves fully to evaluate and explore, which is that itâs a lemon. Thatâs odd, thereâs a noise coming from the boot, I thought Iâd just closed it properly.
âAnyway, the main thingâs Richard. And the point is that thereâs only one person whoâs really in a position to know if heâs getting the important work done, or if heâs just dreaming, and that one person is, Iâm afraid, Susan.
âThatâs you, I mean, of course, not secretary Susan at the office.
âSo can you, I donât like to ask you this, I really donât, can you really get on his case? Make him see how important it is? Just make sure he realises that WayForward Technologies is meant to be an expanding commercial business, not an adventure playground for crunch-heads. Thatâs the problem with crunch-heads -- they have one great idea that actually works and then they expect you to carry on funding them for years while they sit and calculate the topographies of their navels. Iâm sorry, Iâm going to have to stop and close the boot properly. Wonât be a moment.â

He put the telephone down on the seat beside him, pulled over on to the grass verge, and got out. As he went to the boot, it opened, a figure rose out of it, shot him through the chest with both barrels of a shotgun and then went about its business.
Gordon Wayâs astonishment at being suddenly shot dead was nothing to his astonishment at what happened next.
CHAPTER 8
âCome in, dear fellow, come in.â
The door to Regâs set of rooms in college was up a winding set of wooden stairs in the corner of Second Court, and was not well lit, or rather it was perfectly well lit when the light was working, but the light was not working, so the door was not well lit and was, furthermore, locked. Reg was having difficulty in finding the key from a collection which looked like something that a fit Ninja warrior could hurl through the trunk of a tree.
Rooms in the older parts of the college have double doors, like airlocks, and like airlocks they are fiddly to open. The outer door is a sturdy slab of grey painted oak, with no features other than a very narrow slit for letters, and a Yale lock, to which suddenly Reg at last found the key.
He unlocked it and pulled it open. Behind it lay an ordinary white-panelled door with an ordinary brass doorknob.
âCome in, come in,â repeated Reg, opening this and fumbling for the light switch. For a moment only the dying embers of a fire in the stone grate threw ghostly red shadows dancing around the room, but then electric light flooded it and extinguished the magic. Reg hesitated on the threshold for a moment, oddly tense, as if wishing to be sure of something before he entered, then bustled in with at least the appearance of cheeriness.

It was a large panelled room, which a collection of gently shabby furniture contrived to fill quite comfortably. Against the far wall stood a large and battered old mahogany table with fat ugly legs, which was laden with books, files, folders and teetering piles of papers. Standing in its own space on the desk, Richard was amused to note, was actually a battered old abacus.
There was a small Regency writing desk standing nearby which might have been quite valuable had it not been knocked about so much, also a couple of elegant Georgian chairs, a portentous Victorian bookcase, and so on. It was, in short, a donâs room. It had a donâs framed maps and prints on the walls a threadbare and faded donâs carpet on the floor, and it looked as if little had changed in it for decades, which was probably the case because a don lived in it.
Two doors led out from either end of the opposite wall, and Richard knew
from previous visits that one led to a study which looked much like a smaller and more intense version of this room -- larger clumps of books, taller piles of paper in more imminent danger of actually falling, furniture which, however old and valuable, was heavily marked with myriad rings of hot tea or coffee cups, on many of which the original cups themselves were probably still standing.
The other door led to a small and rather basically equipped kitchen, and a twisty internal staircase at the top of which lay the Professorâs bedroom and bathroom.
âTry and make yourself comfortable on the sofa,â invited Reg, fussing around hospitably. âI donât know if youâll manage it. It always feels to me as
if itâs been stuffed with cabbage leaves and cutlery.â He peered at Richard seriously. âDo you have a good sofa?â he enquired.âWell, yes.â Richard laughed. He was cheered by the silliness of the question.
âOh,â said Reg solemnly. âWell, I wish youâd tell me where you got it. I have endless trouble with them, quite endless. Never found a comfortable one in all my life. How do you find yours?â He encountered, with a slight air of surprise, a small silver tray he had left out with a decanter of port and three

glasses.
âWell, itâs odd you should ask that,â said Richard. âIâve never sat on it.â
âVery wise,â insisted Reg earnestly, âvery, very wise.â He went through a palaver similar to his previous one with his coat and hat.
âNot that I wouldnât like to,â said Richard. âItâs just that itâs stuck halfway up a long flight of stairs which leads up into my flat. As far as I can make it out, the delivery men got it part way up the stairs, got it stuck, turned it around any way they could, couldnât get it any further, and then found, curiously enough, that they couldnât get it back down again. Now, that should be impossible.â
âOdd,âagreedReg. âIâvecertainly never comeacrossany irreversible mathematics involving sofas. Could be a new field. Have you spoken to any spatial geometricians?â
âI did better than that. I called in a neighbourâs kid who used to be able to solve Rubikâs cube in seventeen seconds. He sat on a step and stared at it for over an hour before pronouncing it irrevocably stuck. Admittedly heâs a few years older now and has found out about girls, but itâs got me puzzled.â
âCarry on talking, my dear fellow, Iâm most interested, but let me know first if thereâs anything I can get you. Port perhaps? Or brandy? The port I think is the better bet, laid down by the college in 1934, one of the finest vintages I think youâll find, and on the other hand I donât actually have any brandy. Or coffee? Some more wine perhaps? Thereâs an excellent Margaux Iâve been looking for an excuse to open, though it should of course be allowed to stand open for an hour or two, which is not to say that I couldnât... no,â he said hurriedly, âprobably best not to go for the Margaux tonight.â
âTea is what I would really like,â said Richard, âif you have some.âReg raised his eyebrows. âAre you sure?â
âI have to drive home.â
âIndeed. Then I shall be a moment or two in the kitchen. Please carry on, I

shall still be able to hear you. Continue to tell me of your sofa, and do feel free in the meantime to sit on mine. Has it been stuck there for long?â
âOh, only about three weeks,â said Richard, sitting down. âI could just saw it up and throw it away, but I canât believe that there isnât a logical answer. And it also made me think -- it would be really useful to know before you buy a piece of furniture whether itâs actually going to fit up the stairs or around the corner. So Iâve modelled the problem in three dimensions on my computer -- and so far it just says no way.â
âIt says what?â called Reg, over the noise of filling the kettle.
âThat it canât be done. I told it to compute the moves necessary to get the sofa out, and it said there arenât any. I said âWhat?â and it said there arenât any. I then asked it, and this is the really mysterious thing, to compute the moves necessary to get the sofa into its present position in the first place, and it said that it couldnât have got there. Not without fundamental restructuring of the walls. So, either thereâs something wrong with the fundamental structure of the matter in my walls or,â he added with a sigh, âthereâs something wrong with the program. Which would you guess?â
âAnd are you married?â called Reg.
âWhat? Oh, I see what you mean. A sofa stuck on the stairs for a month. Well, no, not married as such, but yes, there is a specific girl that Iâm not married to.â
âWhatâs she like? What does she do?â
âSheâs a professional cellist. I have to admit that the sofa has been a bit of a talking point. In fact sheâs moved back to her own flat until I get it sorted out. She, well...â
He was suddenly sad, and he stood up and wandered around the room in a desultory sort of way and ended up in front of the dying fire. He gave it a bit of a poke and threw on a couple of extra logs to try and ward off the chill of the room.

âSheâs Gordonâs sister, in fact,â he added at last. âBut they are very different. Iâm not sure she really approves of computers very much. And she doesnât much like his attitude to money. I donât think I entirely blame her, actually, and she doesnât know the half of it.â
âWhich is the half she doesnât know?â
Richard sighed.
âWell,â he said, âitâs to do with the project which first made the software incarnation of the company profitable. It was called Reason, and in its own way it was sensational.â
âWhat was it?â
âWell, it was a kind of back-to-front program. Itâs funny how many of the best ideas are just an old idea back-to-front. You see there have already been several programs written that help you to arrive at decisions by properly ordering and analysing all the relevant facts so that they then point naturally towards the right decision. The drawback with these is that the decision which all the properly ordered and analysed facts point to is not necessarily the one you want.â
âYeeeess...â said Regâs voice from the kitchen.
âWell, Gordonâs great insight was to design a program which allowed you to specify in advance what decision you wished it to reach, and only then to give it all the facts. The programâs task, which it was able to accomplish with consummate ease, was simply to construct a plausible series of logical- sounding steps to connect the premises with the conclusion.
âAnd I have to say that it worked brilliantly. Gordon was able to buy himself a Porsche almost immediately despite being completely broke and a hopeless driver. Even his bank manager was unable to find fault with his reasoning. Even when Gordon wrote it off three weeks later.â

âHeavens. And did the program sell very well?ââNo. We never sold a single copy.â
âYou astonish me. It sounds like a real winner to me.â
âIt was,â said Richard hesitantly. âThe entire project was bought up, lock, stock and barrel, by the Pentagon. The deal put WayForward on a very sound financial foundation. Its moral foundation, on the other hand, is not something I would want to trust my weight to. Iâve recently been analysing a lot of the arguments put forward in favour of the Star Wars project, and if you know what youâre looking for, the pattern of the algorithms is very clear.
âSo much so, in fact, that looking at Pentagon policies over the last couple of years I think I can be fairly sure that the US Navy is using version 2.00 of the program, while the Air Force for some reason only has the beta-test version of 1.5. Odd, that.â
âDo you have a copy?â
âCertainly not,â said Richard, âI wouldnât have anything to do with it. Anyway, whenthePentagonboughteverything, they bought everything. Every scrap of code, every disk, every notebook. I was glad to see the back of it. If indeed we have. I just busy myself with my own projects.â
He poked at the fire again and wondered what he was doing here when he had so much work on. Gordon was on at him continually about getting the new, super version of Anthem ready for taking advantage of the Macintosh II, and he was well behind with it. And as for the proposed module for converting incoming Dow Jones stock-market information into MIDI data in real time, heâd only meant that as a joke, but Gordon, of course,hadflipped overthe idea and insisted on its being implemented. That too was meant to be ready but wasnât. He suddenly knew exactly why it was he was here.
Well, it had been a pleasant evening, even if he couldnât see why Reg had been quite so keen to see him. He picked up a couple of books from the table. The table obviously doubled as a dining table, because although the piles looked as if they had been there for weeks, the absence of dust immediately

around them showed that they had been moved recently.
Maybe, he thought, the need for amiable chit-chat with someone different can become as urgent as any other need when you live in a community as enclosed as a Cambridge college was, even nowadays. He was a likeable old fellow, but it was clear from dinner that many of his colleagues found his eccentricities formed rather a rich sustained diet -- particularly when they had so many of their own to contend with. A thought about Susan nagged him, but
he was used to that. He flipped through the two books heâd picked up.
One of them, an elderly one, was an account of the hauntings of Borley Rectory, the most haunted house in England. Its spine was getting raggedy, and the photographic plates were so grey and blurry as to be virtually indistinguishable. A picture he thought must be a very lucky (or faked) shot of a ghostly apparition turned out, when he examined the caption, to be a portrait of the author.
The other book was more recent, and by an odd coincidence was a guide to the Greek islands. He thumbed through it idly and a piece of paper fell out.
âEarl Grey or Lapsang Souchong?â called out Reg. âOr Darjeeling? Or PG Tips? Itâs all tea bags anyway, Iâm afraid. And none of them very fresh.â
âDarjeeling will do fine,â replied Richard, stooping to pick up the piece of paper.
âMilk?â called Reg. âEr, please.â
âOne lump or two?â âOne, please.â
Richard slipped the paper back into the book, noticing as he did so that it had a hurriedly scribbled note on it. The note said, oddly enough, âRegard this simple silver salt cellar. Regard this simple hat.â

âSugar?â
âEr, what?â said Richard, startled. He put the book hurriedly back on the pile.
âJust a tiny joke of mine,â said Reg cheerily, âto see if people are listening.â He emerged beaming from the kitchen carrying a small tray with two cups on it, which he hurled suddenly to the floor. The tea splashed over the carpet. One of the cups shattered and the other bounced under the table. Reg leaned against the door frame, white-faced and staring.
A frozen instant of time slid silently by while Richard was too startled to react, then he leaped awkwardly forward to help. But the old man was already apologising and offering to make him another cup. Richard helped him to the sofa.
âAre you all right?â asked Richard helplessly. âShall I get a doctor?â
Reg waved him down. âItâs all right,â he insisted, âIâm perfectly well. Thought I heard, well, a noise that startled me. But it was nothing. Just overcome with the tea fumes, I expect. Let me just catch my breath. I think a little, er, port will revive me excellently. So sorry, I didnât mean to startle you.â He waved in the general direction of the port decanter. Richard hurriedly poured a small glass and gave it to him.
âWhat kind of noise?â he asked, wondering what on earth could shock him so much.
At that moment came thesound of movement upstairsand an extraordinary kind of heavy breathing noise.
âThat...â whispered Reg. The glass of port lay shattered at his feet. Upstairs someone seemed to be stamping. âDid you hear it?â
âWell, yes.â
This seemed to relieve the old man.

Richard looked nervously up at the ceiling. âIs there someone up there?â he asked, feeling this was a lame question, but one that had to be asked.
âNo,â said Reg in a low voice that shocked Richard with the fear it carried, âno one. Nobody that should be there.â
âThen...â
Reg was struggling shakily to his feet, but there was suddenly a fierce determination about him.
âI must go up there,â he said quietly. âI must. Please wait for me here.â
âLook, what is this?â demanded Richard, standing between Reg and the doorway. âWhat is it, a burglar? Look, Iâll go. Iâm sure itâs nothing, itâs just the wind or something.â Richard didnât know why he was saying this. It clearly wasnât the wind, or even anything like the wind, because though the wind might conceivably make heavy breathing noises, it rarely stamped its feet in that way.
âNo,â the old man said, politely but firmly moving him aside, âit is for me to do.â
Richard followed him helplessly through the door into the small hallway, beyond which lay the tiny kitchen. A dark wooden staircase led up from here; the steps seemed damaged and scuffed.
Reg turned on a light. It was a dim one that hung naked at the top of the stairwell, and he looked up it with grim apprehension.
âWait here,â he said, and walked up two steps. He then turned and faced Richard with a look of the most profound seriousness on his face.âI am sorry,â he said, âthat you have become involved in what is... the more difficult side of my life. But you are involved now, regrettable though that may be, and there is something I must ask you. I do not know what awaits me up there, do not know exactly. I do not know if it is something which I have foolishly

brought upon myself with my... my hobbies, or if it is something to which I have fallen an innocent victim. If it is the former, then I have only myself to blame, for I am like a doctor who cannot give up smoking, or perhaps worse still, like an ecologist who cannot give up his car -- if the latter, then I hope it may not happen to you.
âWhat I must ask you is this. When I come back down these stairs, always supposing of course that I do, then if my behaviour strikes you as being in any way odd, if I appear not to be myself, then you must leap on me and wrestle me to the ground. Do you understand? You must prevent me from doing anything I may try to do.â
âBut how will I know?â asked an incredulous Richard. âSorry I donât mean it to sound like that, but I donât know what...?â
âYou will know,â said Reg. âNow please wait for me in the main room. And close the door.â
Shaking his head in bewilderment, Richard stepped back and did as he was asked. From inside the large untidy room he listened to the sound of the Professorâs tread mounting the stairs one at a time.
He mounted them with a heavy deliberation, like the ticking of a great, slow clock.
Richard heard him reach the top landing. There he paused in silence. Seconds went by, five, maybe ten, maybe twenty. Then came again the heavy movement and breath that had first so harrowed the Professor.
Richard moved quickly to the door but did not open it. The chill of the room oppressed and disturbed him. He shook his head to try and shake off the feeling, and then held his breath as the footsteps started once again slowly to traverse the two yards of the landing and to pause there again.
After only a few seconds, this time Richard heard the long slow squeak of a door being opened inch by inch, inch by cautious inch, until it must surely now at last be standing wide agape.

Nothing further seemed to happen for a long, long time. Then at last the door closed once again, slowly.
The footsteps crossed the landing and paused again. Richard backed a few slight paces from the door, staring fixedly at it. Once more the footsteps started to descend the stairs, slowly, deliberately and quietly, until at last they reached the bottom. Then after a few seconds more the door handle began to rotate. The door opened and Reg walked calmly in.
âItâs all right, itâs just a horse in the bathroom,â he said quietly. Richard leaped on him and wrestled him to the ground.
âNo,â gasped Reg, âno, get off me, let me go, Iâm perfectly all right, damn it. Itâs just a horse, a perfectly ordinary horse.â He shook Richard off with no great difficulty and sat up, puffing and blowing and pushing his hands through his limited hair. Richard stood over him warily, but with great and mounting embarrassment. He edged back, and let Reg stand up and sit on a chair.
âJust a horse,â said Reg, âbut, er, thank you for taking me at my word.â He brushed himself down.
âA horse,â repeated Richard.
âYes,â said Reg.
Richard went out and looked up the stairs and then came back in.
âA horse?â he said again.
âYes, it is,â said the Professor. âWait --â he motioned to Richard, who was about to go out again and investigate -- âlet it be. It wonât be long.â
Richard stared in disbelief. âYou say thereâs a horse in your bathroom, and

all you can do is stand there naming Beatles songs?â The Professor looked blankly at him.
âListen,â he said, âIâm sorry if I... alarmed you earlier, it was just a slight turn. These things happen, my dear fellow, donât upset yourself about it. Dear me, Iâve known odder things in my time. Many of them. Far odder. Sheâs only a horse, for heavenâs sake. Iâll go and let her out later. Please donât concern yourself. Let us revive our spirits with some port.â
âBut... how did it get in there?â
âWell, the bathroom windowâs open. I expect she came in through that.â
Richard looked at him, not for the first and certainly not for the last time, through eyes that were narrowed with suspicion.
âYouâre doing it deliberately, arenât you?â he said.
âDoing what, my dear fellow?â
âI donât believe thereâs a horse in your bathroom,â said Richard suddenly. âI donât know what is there, I donât know what youâre doing, I donât know what any of this evening means, but I donât believe thereâs a horse in your bathroom.â And brushing aside Regâs further protestations he went up to look.
The bathroom was not large.
The walls were panelled in old oak linenfold which, given the age and nature of the building, was quite probably priceless, but otherwise the fittings were stark and institutional.
There was old, scuffed, black-and-white checked linoleum on the floor, a small basic bath, well cleaned but with very elderly stains and chips in the enamel, and also a small basic basin with a toothbrush and toothpaste in a Duralex beaker standing next to the taps. Screwed into the probably priceless panelling above the basin was a tin mirror-fronted bathroom cabinet. It looked

as if it had been repainted many times, and the mirror was stained round the edges with condensation. The lavatory had an old-fashioned cast-iron chain- pull cistern. There was an old cream-painted wooden cupboard standing in the corner, with an old brown bentwood chair next to it, on which lay some neatly folded but threadbare small towels. There was also a large horse in the room, taking up most of it.
Richard stared at it, and it stared at Richard in an appraising kind of way. Richard swayed slightly. The horse stood quite still. After a while it looked at the cupboard instead. It seemed, if not content, then at least perfectly resigned to being where it was until it was put somewhere else. It also seemed... what was it?
It was bathed in the glow of the moonlight that streamed in through the window. The window was open but small and was, besides, on the second floor, so the notion that the horse had entered by that route was entirely fanciful.
There was something odd about the horse, but he couldnât say what. Well, there was one thing that was clearly very odd about it indeed, which was that it was standing in a college bathroom. Maybe that was all.
He reached out, rather tentatively, to pat the creature on its neck. It felt normal - - firm, glossy, it was in good condition. The effect of the moonlight on its coat was a little mazy, but everything looks a little odd by moonlight. The horse shook its mane a little when he touched it, but didnât seem to mind too much.
After the success of patting it, Richard stroked it a few times and scratched it gently under the jaw. Then he noticed that there was another door into the bathroom, in the far corner. He moved cautiously around the horse and approached the other door. He backed up against it and pushed it open tentatively.
It just opened into the Professorâs bedroom, a small room cluttered with books and shoes and a small single bed. This room, too, had another door, which opened out on to the landing again.

Richard noticed that the floor of the landing was newly scuffed and scratched as the stairs had been, and these marks were consistent with the idea that the horse had somehow been pushed up the stairs. He wouldnât have liked to have had to do it himself, and he would have liked to have been the horse having it done to him even less, but it was just about possible.
But why? He had one last look at the horse, which had one last look back at him, and then he returned downstairs.
âI agree,â he said. âYou have a horse in your bathroom and I will, after all, have a little port.â
He poured some for himself, and then some for Reg, who was quietly contemplating the fire and was in need of a refill.
âJust as well I did put out three glasses after all,â said Reg chattily. âI wondered why earlier, and now I remember.âYou asked if you could bring a friend, but appear not to have done so. On account of the sofa no doubt. Never mind, these things happen. Whoa, not too much, youâll spill it.â
All horse-related questions left Richardâs mind abruptly. âI did?â he said.
âOh yes. I remember now. You rang me back to ask me if it would be all right, as I recall. I said I would be charmed, and fully intended to be. Iâd saw the thing up if I were you. Donât want to sacrifice your happiness to a sofa. Or maybe she decided that an evening with your old tutor would be blisteringly dull and opted for the more exhilarating course of washing her hair instead. Dear me, I know what I would have done. Itâs only lack of hair that forces me to pursue such a hectic social round these days.â
It was Richardâs turn to be white-faced and staring.
Yes, he had assumed that Susan would not want to come.
Yes, he had said to her it would be terribly dull. But she had insisted that she

wanted to come because it would be the only way sheâd get to see his face for a few minutes not bathed in the light of a computer screen, so he had agreed and arranged that he would bring her after all.
Only he had completely forgotten this. He had not picked her up. He said, âCan I use your phone, please?â
CHAPTER 9
Gordon Way lay on the ground, unclear about what to do.
He was dead. There seemed little doubt about that. There was a horrific hole in his chest, but the blood that was gobbing out of it had slowed to a trickle. Otherwise there was no movement from his chest at all, or, indeed, from any other part of him.
He looked up, and from side to side, and it became clear to him that whatever part of him it was that was moving, it wasnât any part of his body.
The mist rolled slowly over him, and explained nothing. At a few feet distant from him his shotgun lay smoking quietly in the grass.
He continued to lie there, like someone lying awake at four oâclock in the morning, unable to put their mind to rest, but unable to find anything to do with it. He realised that he had just had something of a shock, which might account for his inability to think clearly, but didnât account for his ability actually to think at all.
In the great debate that has raged for centuries about what, if anything, happens to you after death, be it heaven, hell, purgatory or extinction, one thing has never been in doubt -- that you would at least know the answer when you were dead.

Gordon Way was dead, but he simply hadnât the slightest idea what he was meant to do about it. It wasnât a situation he had encountered before.
He sat up. The body that sat up seemed as real to him as the body that still lay slowly cooling on the ground, giving up its blood heat in wraiths of steam that mingled with the mist of the chill night air.Experimentingabit further, hetried standing up, slowly, wonderingly and wobblingly. The ground seemed to give him support, it took his weight. But then of course he appeared to have no weight that needed to be taken. When he bent to touch the ground he could feel nothing save a kind of distant rubbery resistance like the sensation you get if you try and pick something up when your arm has gone dead. His arm had gone dead. His legs too, and his other arm, and all his torso and his head.
His body was dead. He could not say why his mind was not.
He stood in a kind of frozen, sleepless horror while the mist curled slowly through him.
He looked back down at the him, the ghastly, astonished-looking him-thing lying still and mangled on the ground, and his flesh wanted to creep. Or rather, he wanted flesh that could creep. He wanted flesh. He wanted body. He had none.
A sudden cry of horror escaped from his mouth but was nothing and went nowhere. He shook and felt nothing.
Music and a pool of light seeped from his car. He walked towards it. He tried to walk sturdily, but it was a faint and feeble kind of walking, uncertain and, well, insubstantial. The ground felt frail beneath his feet.
The door of the car was still open on the driverâs side, as he had left it when he had leaped out to deal with the boot lid, thinking heâd only be two seconds.
That was all of two minutes ago now, when heâd been alive. When heâd been a person. When heâd thought he was going to be leaping straight back in and driving off. Two minutes and a lifetime ago.

This was insane, wasnât it? he thought suddenly.
He walked around the door and bent down to peer into the external rear-view mirror.
He looked exactly like himself, albeit like himself after heâd had a terrible fright, which was to be expected, but that was him, that was normal. This must be something he was imagining, some horrible kind of waking dream. He had a sudden thought and tried breathing on the rear-view mirror.
Nothing. Not a single droplet formed. That would satisfy a doctor, thatâs what they always did on television -- if no mist formed on the mirror, there was no breath. Perhaps, he thought anxiously to himself, perhaps it was something to do with having heated wing mirrors. Didnât this car have heated wing mirrors? Hadnât the salesman gone on and on about heated this, electric that, and servo- assisted the other? Maybe they were digital wing mirrors. That was it. Digital, heated, servo-assisted, computer-controlled, breath-resistant wing mirrors...
He was, he realised, thinking complete nonsense. He turned slowly and gazed again in apprehension at the body lying on the ground behind him with half its chest blown away. That would certainly satisfy a doctor. The sight would be appalling enough if it was somebody elseâs body, but his own...
He was dead. Dead... dead... He tried to make the word toll dramatically in his mind, but it wouldnât. He was not a film sound track, he was just dead.
Peering at his body in appalled fascination, he gradually became distressed by the expression of asinine stupidity on its face.
It was perfectly understandable, of course. It was just such an expression as somebody who is in the middle of being shot with his own shotgun by somebody who had been hiding in the boot of his car might be expected to wear, but he nevertheless disliked the idea that anyone might find him looking like that.
He knelt down beside it in the hope of being able to rearrange his

featuresintosomesemblanceof dignity, or atleast basic intelligence.
It proved to be almost impossibly difficult. He tried to knead the skin, the sickeningly familiar skin, but somehow he couldnât seem to get a proper grip on it, or on anything. It was like trying to model plasticine when your arm has gone to sleep, except that instead of his grip slipping off the model, it would slip through it. In this case, his hand slipped through his face.
Nauseated horror and rage swept through him at his sheer bloody blasted impotence, and he was suddenly startled to find himself throttling and shaking his own dead body with a firm and furious grip. He staggered back in amazed shock. All he had managed to do was to add to the inanely stupefied look of the corpse a twisted-up mouth and a squint. And bruises flowering on its neck.
He started to sob, and this time sound seemed to come, a strange howling from deep within whatever this thing he had become was. Clutching his hands to his face, he staggered backwards, retreated to his car and flung himself into the seat. The seat received him in a loose and distant kind of way, like an aunt who disapproves of the last fifteen years of your life and will therefore furnish you with a basic sherry, but refuses to catch your eye.
Could he get himself to a doctor?
To avoid facing the absurdity of the idea he grappled violently with the steering wheel, but his hands slipped through it. He tried to wrestle with the automatic transmission shift and ended up thumping it in rage, but not being able properly to grasp or push it.
The stereo was still playing light orchestral music into the telephone, which had been lying on the passenger seat listening patiently all this time. He stared at it and realised with a growing fever of excitement that he was still connected to Susanâs telephone-answering machine. It was the type that would simply run and run until he hung up. He was still in contact with the world.
He tried desperately to pick up the receiver, fumbled, let it slip, and was in the

end reduced to bending himself down over its mouthpiece. âSusan!â he cried into it, his voice a hoarse and distant wail on the wind. âSusan, help me! Help me for Godâs sake. Susan, Iâm dead... Iâm dead... Iâm dead and... I donât know what to do...â He broke down again, sobbing in desperation, and tried to cling to the phone like a baby clinging to its blanket for comfort.
âHelp me, Susan...â he cried again. âBeep,â said the phone.
He looked down at it again where he was cuddling it. He had managed to push something after all. He had managed to push the button which disconnected the call. Feverishly he attempted to grapple the thing again, but it constantly slipped through his fingers and eventually lay immobile on the seat. He could not touch it. He could not push the buttons. In rage he flung it at the windscreen. It responded to that, all right. It hit the windscreen, careered straight back though him, bounced off the seat and then lay still on the transmission tunnel, impervious to all his further attempts to touch it.
For several minutes still he sat there, his head nodding slowly as terror began to recede into blank desolation.
A couple of cars passed by, but would have noticed nothing odd -- a car stopped by the wayside. Passing swiftly in the night their headlights would probably not have picked out the body lying in the grass behind the car. They certainly would not have noticed a ghost sitting inside it crying to himself.
He didnât know how long he sat there. He was hardly aware of time passing, only that it didnât seem to pass quickly. There was little external stimulus to mark its passage. He didnât feel cold. In fact he could almost not remember what cold meant or felt like, he just knew that it was something he would have expected to feel at this moment.
Eventually he stirred from his pathetic huddle. He would have to do something, though he didnât know what. Perhaps he should try and reach his cottage, though he didnât know what he would do when he got there. He just needed

something to try for. He needed to make it through the night.
Pulling himself together he slipped out of the car, his foot and knee grazing easily through part of the door frame. He went to look again at his body, but it wasnât there.
As if the night hadnât produced enough shocks already. He started, and stared at the damp depression in the grass.
His body was not there.
CHAPTER 10
Richard made the hastiest departure that politeness would allow.
He said thank you very much and what a splendid evening it had been and that any time Reg was coming up to London he must let him, Richard, know and was there anything he could do to help about the horse. No? Well, all right then, if youâre sure, and thank you again, so much.
He stood there for a moment or two after the door finally closed, pondering things.
He had noticed during the short time that the light from Regâs room flooded out on to the landing of the main staircase, that there were no marks on the floorboards there at all. It seemed odd that the horse should only have scuffed the floorboards inside Regâs room.
Well, it all seemed very odd, full stop, but here was yet another curious fact to add to the growing pile. This was supposed to have been a relaxing evening away from work.
On an impulse he knocked on the door opposite to Regâs. It took such a long time to be answered that Richard had given up and was turning to go when at

last he heard the door creak open.
He had a slight shock when he saw that staring sharply up at him like a small and suspicious bird was the don with the racing-yacht keel for a nose.
âEr, sorry,â said Richard, abruptly, âbut, er, have you seen or heard a horse coming up this staircase tonight?â
The man stopped his obsessive twitching of his fingers. He cocked his head slightly on one side and then seemed to need to go on a long journey inside himself to find a voice, which when found turned out to be a thin and soft little one.
He said, âThat is the first thing anybody has said to me for seventeen years, three months and two days, five hours, nineteen minutes and twenty seconds. Iâve been counting.â
He closed the door softly again.
Richard virtually ran through Second Court.
When he reached First Court he steadied himself and slowed down to a walking pace.
The chill night air was rasping in his lungs and there was no point in running. He hadnât managed to talk to Susan because Regâs phone wasnât working,andthis wasanother thing that he had been mysteriously coy about. That at least was susceptible of a rational explanation. He probably hadnât paid his phone bill.
Richard was about to emerge out on to the street when instead he decided to pay a quick visit to the porterâs lodge, which was tucked away inside the great archway entrance into the college. It was a small hutchlike place filled with keys, messages and a single electric bar heater. A radio nattered to itself in the background.
âExcuse me,â he said to the large black-suited man standing behind the counter

with his arms folded. âI...â
âYes, Mr MacDuff, what can I do for you?â
In his present state of mind Richard would have been hard-pressed himself to remember his own name and was startled for a moment. However, college porters are legendary for their ability to perform such feats of memory, and for their tendency to show them off at the slightest provocation.
âIs there,â said Richard, âa horse anywhere in the college -- that you know of? I mean, you would know if there was a horse in the college, wouldnât you?â
The porter didnât blink.
âNo, sir, and yes, sir. Anything else I can help you with, Mr MacDuff, sir?â
âEr, no,â said Richard and tapped his fingers a couple of times on the counter. âNo. Thank you. Thank you very much for your help. Nice to see you again, er... Bob,â he hazarded. âGood-night, then.â
He left.
The porter remained perfectly still with his arms folded, but shaking his head a very, very little bit.
âHereâs some coffee for you, Bill,â said another porter, a short wiry one, emerging from an inner sanctum with a steaming cup. âGetting a bit colder tonight?â
âI think it is, Fred, thanks,â said Bill, taking the cup.
He took a sip. âYou can say what you like about people, they donât get any less peculiar. Fellow in here just now asking if there was a horse in the college.â
âOh yes?â Fred sipped at his own coffee, and let the steam smart his eyes. âI had a chap in here earlier. Sort of strange foreign priest. Couldnât understand a

word he said at first. But he seemed happy just to stand by the fire and listen to the news on the radio.â
âForeigners, eh.â
âIn the end I told him to shoot off. Standing in front of my fire like that. Suddenly he says is that really what he must do? Shoot off? I said, in my best Bogart voice, âYou better believe it, buddy.âââReally? Sounded more like Jimmy Cagney to me.â
âNo, thatâs my Bogart voice. This is my Jimmy Cagney voice -- âYou better believe it, buddy.ââ
Bill frowned at him. âIs that your Jimmy Cagney voice? I always thought that was your Kenneth McKellar voice.â
âYou donât listen properly, Bill, you havenât got the ear. This is Kenneth McKellar. âOh, you take the high road and Iâll take the low road...ââ
âOh, I see. I was thinking of the Scottish Kenneth McKellar. So what did this priest fellow say then, Fred?â
âOh, he just looked me straight in the eyes, Bill, and said in this strange sort of...â
âSkip the accent, Fred, just tell me what he said, if itâs worth hearing.â âHe just said he did believe me.â
âSo. Not a very interesting story then, Fred.â
âWell, maybe not. I only mention it because he also said that heâd left his horse in a washroom and would I see that it was all right.â

CHAPTER 11
Gordon Way drifted miserably along the dark road, or rather, tried to drift.
He felt that as a ghost -- which is what he had to admit to himself he had become -- he should be able to drift. He knew little enough about ghosts, but he felt that if you were going to be one then there ought to be certain compensations for not having a physical body to lug around, and that among them ought to be the ability simply to drift. But no, it seemed he was going to have to walk every step of the way.
His aim was to try and make it to his house. He didnât know what he would do when he got there, but even ghosts have to spend the night somewhere, and he felt that being in familiar surroundings might help. Help what, he didnât know. At least the journey gave him an objective, and he would just have to think of another one when he arrived.
He trudged despondently from lamppost to lamppost, stopping at each one to look at bits of himself.
He was definitely getting a bit wraithlike.
At times he would fade almost to nothing, and would seem to be little more than a shadow playing in the mist, a dream of himself that could just evaporate and be gone. At other times he seemed to be almost solid and real again. Once or twice he would try leaning against a lamppost, and would fall straight through it if he wasnât careful.
At last, and with great reluctance, he actually began to turn his mind to what it was that had happened. Odd, that reluctance. He really didnât want to think about it. Psychologists say that the mind will often try to suppress the memory of traumatic events, and this, he thought, was probably the answer. After all, if having a strange figure jump out of the boot of your own car and shoot you dead didnât count as a traumatic experience, heâd like to know what did.
He trudged on wearily.

He tried to recall the figure to his mindâs eye, but it was like probing a hurting tooth, and he thought of other things.
Like, was his will up-to-date? He couldnât remember, and made a mental note to call his lawyer tomorrow, and then made another mental note that he would have to stop making mental notes like that.
How would his company survive without him? He didnât like either of the possible answers to that very much.
What about his obituary? There was a thought that chilled him to his bones, wherever theyâd got to. Would he be able to get hold of a copy? What would it say? Theyâd better give him a good write-up, the bastards. Look at what heâd done. Single-handedly saved the British software industry: huge exports, charitable contributions, research scholarships, crossing the Atlantic in a solar-poweredsubmarine (failed, but a good try) -- all sorts of things. Theyâd better not go digging up that Pentagon stuff again or heâd get his lawyer on to them. He made a mental note to call him in the mor...
No.
Anyway, can a dead person sue for libel? Only his lawyer would know, and he was not going to be able to call him in the morning. He knew with a sense of creeping dread that of all the things he had left behind in the land of the living it was the telephone that he was going to miss the most, and then he turned his mind determinedly back to where it didnât want to go.
The figure.
It seemed to him that the figure had been almost like a figure of Death itself; or was that his imagination playing tricks with him? Was he dreaming that it was a cowled figure? What would any figure, whether cowled or just casually dressed, be doing in the boot of his car?
At that moment a car zipped past him on the road and disappeared off into the night, taking its oasis of light with it. He thought with longing of the warm,

leather-upholstered, climate-controlled comfort of his own car abandoned on the road behind him, and then a sudden extraordinary thought struck him.
Was there any way he could hitch a lift? Could anyone actually see him? How would anyone react if they could? Well, there was only one way to find out.
He heard another car coming up in the distance behind him and turned to face it. The twin pools of hazy lights approached through the mist and Gordon gritted his phantom teeth and stuck his thumb out at them.
The car swept by regardless. Nothing.
Angrily he made an indistinct V sign at the receding red rear lights, and realised, looking straight through his own upraised arm, that he wasnât at his most visible at the moment. Was there perhaps some effort of will he could make to render himself more visible when he wanted to? He screwed up his eyes in concentration, then realised that he would need to have his eyes open in order to judge the results. He tried again, forcing his mind as hard as he could, but the results were unsatisfactory.
Though it did seem to make some kind of rudimentary, glowing difference, he couldnât sustain it, and it faded almost immediately, however much he piled on the mental pressure. He would have to judge the timing very carefully if he was going to make his presence felt, or at least seen.
Another car approached from behind, travelling fast. He turned again, stuck his thumb out, waited till the moment was right and willed himself visible.
The car swerved slightly, and then carried on its way, only a little more slowly. Well, that was something. What else could he do? He would go and stand under a lamppost for a start, and he would practise. The next car he would get for sure.

CHAPTER 12
â...so if youâd like to leave a message, Iâll get back to you as soon as possible. Maybe.â
Beep.
âShit. Damn. Hold on a minute. Blast. Look... er...â
Click.
Richard pushed the phone back into its cradle and slammed his car into reverse for twenty yards to have another look at the signpost by the road junction heâd just sped past in the mist. He had extracted himself from the Cambridge one-way system by the usual method, which involved going round and round it faster and faster until he achieved a sort of escape velocity and flew off at a tangent in a random direction, which he was now trying to identify and correct for.
Arriving back at the junction he tried to correlate the information on the signpost with the information on the map. But it couldnât be done. The road junction was quite deliberately sitting on a page divide on the map, and the signpost was revolving maliciously in the wind. Instinct told him that he was heading in the wrong direction, but he didnât want to go back the way heâd come for fear of getting sucked back into the gravitational whirlpool of Cambridgeâs traffic system.
He turned left, therefore, in the hope of finding better fortune in that direction, but after a while lost his nerve and turned a speculative right, and then chanced another exploratory left and after a few more such manoeuvres was thoroughly lost.
He swore to himself and turned up the heating in the car. If he had been concentrating on where he was going rather than trying to navigate and telephone at the same time, he told himself, he would at least know where he was now. He didnât actually like having a telephone in his car, he found it a bother and an intrusion. But Gordon had insisted and indeed had paid for it.

He sighed in exasperation, backed up the black Saab and turned around again. As he did so he nearly ran into someone lugging a body into a field. At least that was what it looked like for a second to his overwrought brain, but in fact it was probably a local farmer with a sackful of something nutritious, though what he was doing with it on a night like this was anyoneâs guess. As his headlights swung around again, they caught for a moment a silhouette of the figure trudging off across the field with the sack on his back.
âRather him than me,â thought Richard grimly, and drove off again.
After a few minutes he reached a junction with what looked a little more like a main road, nearly turned right down it, but then turned left instead. There was no signpost.
He poked at the buttons on his phone again. â...get back to you as soon as possible. Maybe.â Beep.
âSusan, itâs Richard. Where do I start? What a mess. Look Iâm sorry, sorry, sorry. I screwed up very badly, and itâs all my fault. And look, whatever it takes to make up for it, Iâll do it, solemn promise...â
He had a slight feeling that this wasnât the right tone to adopt with an answering machine, but he carried straight on.
âHonestly, we can go away, take a holiday for a week, or even just this weekend if you like. Really, this weekend. Weâll go somewhere sunny. Doesnât matter how much pressure Gordon tries to put on me, and you know the sort of pressure he can muster, he is your brother, after all. Iâll just... er, actually, it might have to be next weekend. Damn, damn, damn. Itâs just that I really have promised to get, no, look, it doesnât matter. Weâll just do it. I donât care about getting Anthem finished for Comdex. Itâs not the end of the world. Weâll just go. Gordon will just have to take a running jump -- Gaaarghhhh!â

Richard swerved wildly to avoid the spectre of Gordon Way which suddenly loomed in his headlights and took a running jump at him.
He slammed on the brakes, started to skid, tried to remember what it was you were supposed to do when you found yourself skidding, he knew heâd seen it on some television programme about driving heâd seen ages ago, what was the programme? God, he couldnât even remember the title of the programme, let alone -- oh yes, theyâd said you mustnât slam on the brakes. That was it. The world swung sickeningly around him with slow and appalling force as the car slewed across the road, spun, thudded against the grass verge, then slithered and rocked itself to a halt, facing the wrong way. He collapsed, panting, against the steering wheel.
He picked up the phone from where heâd dropped it. âSusan,â he gasped, âIâll get back to you,â and hung up. He raised his eyes.
Standing full in the glare of his headlights was the spectral figure of Gordon Way staring straight in through the windscreen with ghastly horror in its eyes, slowly raising its hand and pointing at him.
He wasnât sure how long he just sat there. The apparition had melted from view in a few seconds, but Richard simply sat, shaking, probably for not more than a minute, until a sudden squeal of brakes and glare of lights roused him.
He shook his head. He was, he realised, stopped in the road facing the wrong way. The car that had just screeched to an abrupt halt almost bumper to bumper with him was a police car. He took two or three deep breaths and then, stiff and trembling, he climbed out and stood up to face the officer who was walking slowly towards him, silhouetted in the police carâs headlights.
The officer looked him up and down.
âEr, Iâm sorry, officer,â said Richard, with as much calmness as he could

wrench into his voice. âI, er, skidded. The roads are slippery and I, er... skidded. I spun round. As you see, I, Iâm facing the wrong way.â He gestured at his car to indicate the way it was facing.
âLike to tell me why it was you skidded then, exactly, sir?â The police officer was looking him straight in the eye while pulling out a notebook.
âWell, as I said,â explained Richard, âthe roads are slippery because of the mist, and, well, to be perfectly honest,â he suddenly found himself saying, in spite of all his attempts to stop himself, âI was just driving along and I suddenly imagined that I saw my employer throwing himself in front of my car.â
The officer gazed at him levelly.
âGuilt complex, officer,â added Richard with a twitch of a smile, âyou know how it is. I was contemplating taking the weekend off.â
The police officer seemed to hesitate, balanced on a knife edge between sympathy and suspicion. His eyes narrowed a little but didnât waver.
âBeen drinking, sir?â
âYes,â said Richard, with a quick sigh, âbut very little. Two glasses of wine max. Er... and a small glass of port. Absolute max. It was really just a lapse of concentration. Iâm fine now.â
âName?â
Richard gave him his name and address. The policeman wrote it all down carefully and neatly in his book, then peered at the car registration number and wrote that down too.
âAnd who is your employer then, sir?â âHis name is Way. Gordon Way.â

âOh,â said the policemanraising his eyebrows, âthe computer gentleman.â
âEr, yes, thatâs right.I design software forthe company. WayForward Technologies II.â
âWeâve got one of your computers down the station,â said the policeman. âBuggered if I can get it to work.â
âOh,â said Richard wearily, âwhich model do you have?â âI think itâs called a Quark II.â
âOh, well thatâs simple,â said Richard with relief. âIt doesnât work. Never has done. The thing is a heap of shit.â
âFunny thing, sir, thatâswhat Iâve alwayssaid,â said the policeman. âSome of the other lads donât agree.â
âWell, youâre absolutely right, officer. The thing is hopeless. Itâs the major reason the original company went bust. I suggest you use it as a big paperweight.â
âWell, I wouldnât like to do that, sir,â the policeman persisted. âThe door would keep blowing open.â
âWhat do you mean, officer?â asked Richard.
âI use it to keep the door closed, sir. Nasty draughts down our station this time of year. In the summer, of course, we beat suspects round the head with it.â
He flipped his book closed and prodded it into his pocket.
âMy advice to you, sir, is to go nice and easy on the way back. Lock up the car and spend the weekend getting completely pissed. I find itâs the only way. Mind how you go now.â

He returned to his car, wound down the window, and watched Richard manoeuvre his car around and drive off into the night before heading off himself.
Richard took a deep breath, drove calmly back to London, let himself calmly into his flat, clambered calmly over the sofa, sat down, poured himself a stiff brandy and began seriously to shake.
There were three things he was shaking about.
There was the simple physical shock of his near-accident, which is the sort of thing that always churns you up a lot more than you expect. The body floods itself with adrenaline, which then hangs around your system turning sour.
Then there was the cause of the skid -- the extraordinary apparition of Gordon throwing himself in front of his car at that moment. Boy oh boy. Richard took a mouthful of brandy and gargled with it. He put the glass down.
It was well known that Gordon was one of the worldâs richest natural resources of guilt pressure, and that he could deliver a ton on your doorstep fresh every morning, but Richard hadnât realised he had let it get to him to such an unholy degree.
He took up his glass again, went upstairs and pushed open the door to his workroom, which involved shifting a stack of BYTE magazines that had toppled against it. He pushed them away with his foot and walked to the end of the large room. A lot of glass at this end let in views over a large part of north London, from which the mist was now clearing. St Paulâs glowed in the dark distance and he stared at it for a moment or two but it didnât do anything special. After the events of the evening he found this came as a pleasant surprise.
At the other end of the room were a couple of long tables smothered in, at the last count, six Macintosh computers. In the middle was the Mac II on which a red wire-frame model of his sofa was lazily revolving within a blue wire-frame model of his narrow staircase, complete with banister rail, radiator and fuse-box details, and of course the awkward turn halfway up.

The sofa would start out spinning in one direction,hit an obstruction, twist itself in another plane, hit another obstruction, revolve round a third axis until it was stopped again, then cycle through the moves again in a different order. You didnât have to watch the sequence for very long before you saw it repeat itself.
The sofa was clearly stuck.
Three other Macs were connected up via long tangles of cable to an untidy agglomeration of synthesisers -- an Emulator II+ HD sampler, a rack of TX modules, a Prophet VS, a Roland JX 10, a Korg DW8000, an Octapad, a left- handed Synth-Axe MIDI guitar controller, and even an old drum machine stacked up and gathering dust in the corner -- pretty much the works. There was also a small and rarely used cassette tape recorder: all the music was stored in sequencer files on the computers rather than on tape.
He dumped himself into a seat in front of one of the Macs to see what, if anything, it was doing. It was displaying an âUntitledâ Excel spreadsheet and he wondered why.
He saved it and looked to see if heâd left himself any notes and quickly discovered that the spreadsheet contained some of the data he had previously downloaded after searching the World Reporter and Knowledge on-line databases for facts about swallows.
He now had figures which detailed their migratory habits, their wing shapes, their aerodynamic profile and turbulence characteristics, and some sort of rudimentary figures concerning the patterns that a flock would adopt in flight, but as yet he had only the faintest idea as to how he was going to synthesise them all together.
Because he was too tired to think particularly constructively tonight he savagely selected and copied a whole swathe of figures from the spreadsheet at random, pasted them into his own conversion program, which scaled and filtered and manipulated the figures according to his ownexperimentalalgorithms,loadedtheconvertedfile into Performer, a

powerful sequencer program, and played the result through random MIDI channels to whichever synthesisers happened to be on at the moment.
The result was a short burst of the most hideous cacophony, and he stopped it.
He ran the conversion program again, this time instructing it to force-map the pitch values into G minor. This was a utility he was determined in the end to get rid of because he regarded it as cheating. If there was any basis to his firmly held belief that the rhythms and harmonies of music which he found most satisfying could be found in, or at least derived from, the rhythms and harmonies of naturally occurring phenomena, then satisfying forms of modality and intonation should emerge naturally as well, rather than being forced.
For the moment, though, he forced it.
The result was a short burst of the most hideous cacophony in G minor. So much for random shortcuts.
The first task was a relatively simple one, which would be simply to plot the waveform described by the tip of a swallowâs wing as it flies, then synthesise that waveform. That way he would end up with a single note, which would be a good start, and it shouldnât take more than the weekend to do.
Except, of course, that he didnât have a weekend available to do it in because he had somehow to get Version 2 of Anthem out of the door sometime during the course of the next year, or âmonthâ as Gordon called it.
Which brought Richard inexorably to the third thing he was shaking about.
There was absolutely no way that he could take the time off this weekend or next to fulfil the promise he had made to Susanâs telephone-answering machine. And that, if this eveningâs dÃ©bacle had not already done so, would surely spell the final end.
But that was it. The thing was done. There is nothing you can do about a

message on someone elseâs answering machine other than let events take their course. It was done. It was irrevocable.
An odd thought suddenly struck him.
It took him by considerable surprise, but he couldnât really see what was wrong with it.
CHAPTER 13
A pair of binoculars scanning the London night skyline, idly, curious, snooping. A little look here, a little look there, just seeing whatâs going on, anything interesting, anything useful.
The binoculars settle on the back of one particular house, attracted by a slight movement. One of those large late-Victorian villas, probably flats now. Lots of black iron drainpipes. Green rubber dustbins. But dark. No, nothing.
The binoculars are just moving onwards when another slight movement catches in the moonlight. The binoculars refocus very slightly, trying to find a detail, a hard edge, a slight contrast in the darkness. The mist has lifted now, and the darkness glistens. They refocus a very, very little more.
There it is. Something, definitely. Only this time a little higher up, maybe a foot or so, maybe a yard. The binoculars settle and relax - - steady, trying for the edge, trying for the detail. There. The binoculars settle again -- they have found their mark, straddled between a windowsill and a drainpipe.
It is a dark figure, splayed against the wall, looking down, looking for a new foothold, looking upwards,looking for a ledge. The binoculars peer intently.
The figure is that of a tall, thin man. His clothes are right for the job, dark trousers, dark sweater, but his movements are awkward and angular. Nervous. Interesting. The binocularswait and consider, consider and judge.

The man is clearly a rank amateur.
Look at his fumbling. Look at his ineptitude. His feet slip on the drainpipe, his hands canât reach the ledge. He nearly falls. He waits to catch his breath. For a moment he starts to climb back down again, but seems to find that even tougher going.
He lunges again for the ledge and this time catches it. His foot shoots out to steady himself and nearly misses the pipe. Could have been very nasty, very nasty indeed.
But now the way is easier and progress is better. He crosses to another pipe, reaches a third-floor window ledge, flirts briefly with death as he crawls painfully on to it, and makes the cardinal error and looks down. He sways briefly and sits back heavily. He shades his eyes and peers inside to check that the room is dark, and sets about getting the window open.
One of the things that distinguish the amateur from the professional is that this is the point when the amateur thinks it would have been a good idea to bring along something to prise the window open with. Luckily for this amateur the householder is an amateur too, and the sash window slides grudgingly up. The climber crawls, with some relief, inside.
He should be locked up for his own protection, think the binoculars. A hand starts to reach for the phone. At the window a face looks back out and for a moment is caught in the moonlight, then it ducks back inside to carry on with its business.
The hand stays hovering over the phone for a moment or two, while the binoculars wait and consider, consider and judge. The hand reaches instead for the A-Z street map of London.
There is a long studious pause, a little more intent binocular work, and then the hand reaches for the phone again, lifts it and dials.

CHAPTER 14
Susanâs flat was small but spacious, which was a trick, reflected Richard tensely as he turned on the light, that only women seemed able to pull off.
It wasnât that observation which made him tense, of course -- heâd thought it before, many times. Every time heâd been in her flat, in fact. It always struck him, usually because he had just come from his own flat, which was four times the size and cramped. Heâd just come from his own flat this time, only via a rather eccentric route, and it was this that made his usual observation unusually tense.
Despite the chill of the night he was sweating.
He looked back out of the window, turned and tiptoed across the room towards where the telephone and the answering machine stood on their own small table.
There was no point, he told himself, in tiptoeing. Susan wasnât in. He would be extremely interested to know where she was, in fact -- just as she, he told himself, had probably been extremely interested in knowing where he had been at the beginning of the evening.
He realised he was still tiptoeing. He hit his leg to make himself stop doing it, but carried on doing it none the less.
Climbing up the outside wall had been terrifying.
He wiped his forehead with the arm of his oldest and greasiest sweater. There had been a nasty moment when his life had flashed before his eyes but he had been too preoccupied with falling and had missed all the good bits. Most of the good bits had involved Susan, he realised. Susan or computers. Never Susan and computers -- those had largely been the bad bits. Which was why he was here, he told himself. He seemed to need convincing, and told himself again.

He looked at his watch. Eleven forty-five.
It occurred to him he had better go and wash his wet and dirty hands before he touched anything. It wasnât the police he was worried about, but Susanâs terrifying cleaner. She would know.
He went into the bathroom, turned on the light switch, wiped it, and then stared at his own startled face in the bright neon-lit mirror as he ran the water over his hands. For a moment he thought of the dancing, warm candlelight of the Coleridge Dinner, and the images of it welled up out of the dim and distant past of the earlier part of the evening. Life had seemed easy then, and carefree. The wine, the conversation, simple conjuring tricks. He pictured the round pale face of Sarah, pop-eyed with wonder. He washed his own face.
He thought:
â...Beware! Beware!
His flashing eyes, his floating hair!â
He brushed his own hair. He thought, too, of the pictures hanging high in the darkness above their heads. He cleaned his teeth. The low buzz of the neon light snapped him back to the present and he suddenly remembered with appalled shock that he was here in his capacity as burglar.
Something made him look himself directly in the face in the mirror, then he shook his head, trying to clear it.
When would Susan be back? That, of course, would depend on what she was doing. He quickly wiped his hands and made his way back to the answering machine. He prodded at the buttons and his conscience prodded back at him. The tape wound back for what seemed to be an interminable time, and he realised with a jolt that it was probably because Gordon had been in full flood.
He had forgotten, of course, that there would be messages on the tape other than his own, and listening to other peopleâs phone messages was tantamount to

opening their mail.
He explained to himself once again that all he was trying to do was to undo a mistake he had made before it caused any irrevocable damage. He would just play the tiniest snippets till he found his own voice. That wouldnât be too bad, he wouldnât even be able to distinguish what was being said.
He groaned inwardly, gritted his teeth and stabbed at the Play button so roughly that he missed it and ejected the cassette by mistake. He put it back in and pushed the Play button more carefully.
Beep.
âOh, Susan, hi, itâs Gordon,â said the answering machine. âIâm just on my way to the cottage. Itâs, er...â He wound on for a couple of seconds. â...need to know that Richard is on the case. I mean really on...â Richard set his mouth grimly and stabbed at the Fast Forward again. He really hated the fact that Gordon tried to put pressure on him via Susan, which Gordon always stoutly denied he did. Richard couldnât blame Susan for getting exasperated about his work sometimes if this sort of thing was going on.âClick.
â...Response. Make a note to Susan would you please, to get an âArmed Responseâ sign made up with a sharp spike on the bottom at the right height for rabbits to see.â
âWhat?â muttered Richard to himself, and his finger hesitated for a second over the Fast Forward button. He had a feeling that Gordon desperately wanted to be like Howard Hughes, and if he could never hope to be remotely as rich, he could at least try to be twice as eccentric. An act. A palpable act.
âThatâs secretary Susan at the office, notyou, of course,â continued Gordonâs voice on the answering machine. âWhere was I? Oh yes. Richard and Anthem 2.00. Susan, that thing has got to be in beta testing in two...â Richard stabbed at the Fast Forward, tight-lipped.
â...point is that thereâs only one person whoâs really in a position to know if heâs getting the important work done, or if heâs just dreaming, and that one

person...â He stabbed angrily again. He had promised himself he wouldnât listen to any of it and now here he was getting angry at what he was hearing. He should really just stop this. Well, just one more try.
When he listened again he just got music. Odd. He wound forward again, and still got music. Why would someone be phoning to play music to an answering machine? he wondered.
The phone rang. He stopped the tape and answered it, then almost dropped the phone like an electric eel as he realised what he was doing. Hardly daring to breathe, he held the telephone to his ear.
âRule One in housebreaking,â said a voice. âNever answer the telephone when youâre in the middle of a job. Who are you supposed to be, for heavenâs sake?â
Richard froze. It was a moment or two before he could find where he had put his voice.
âWho is this?â he demanded at last in a whisper.
âRule Two,â continued the voice. âPreparation. Bring the right tools. Bring gloves. Try to have the faintest glimmering of an idea of what youâre about before you start dangling from window ledges in the middle of the night.
âRule Three. Never forget Rule Two.â âWho is this?â exclaimed Richard again.
The voice was unperturbed. âNeighbourhood Watch,â it said. âIf you just look out of the back window youâll see...â
Trailing the phone, Richard hurried over to the window and looked out. A distant flash startled him.
âRule Four. Never stand where you can be photographed.

âRule Five... Are you listening to me, MacDuff?â
âWhat? Yes...â said Richard in bewilderment. âHow do you know me?â âRule Five. Never admit to your name.â
Richard stood silent, breathing hard.
âI run a little course,â said the voice, âif youâre interested...â
Richard said nothing.
âYouâre learning,âcontinued the voice,âslowly,but youâre learning. If you were learning fast you would have put the phone down by now, of course. But youâre curious -- and incompetent -- and so you donât. I donât run a course for novice burglars as it happens, tempting though the idea is. Iâm sure there would be grants available. If we have to have them they may as well be trained.
âHowever, if I did run such a course I would allow you to enrol for free, because I too am curious. Curious to know why Mr Richard MacDuff who, I am given to understand, is now a wealthy young man, something in the computer industry, I believe, should suddenly be needing to resort to housebreaking.â
âWho -- ?â
âSo I do a little research, phone Directory Enquiries and discover that the flat into which he is breaking is that of a Miss S. Way. I know that Mr Richard MacDuffâs employer is the famous Mr G. Way and I wonder if they can by any chance be related.â
âWho -- ?â
âYou are speaking with Svlad, commonly known as âDirkâ Cjelli, currently trading under the name of Gently for reasons which it would be otiose, at this moment, to rehearse. I bid you good evening. If you wish to know more I will be at the Pizza Express in Upper Street in ten minutes. Bring some money.â

âDirk?â exclaimed Richard. âYou... Are you trying to blackmail me?ââNo, you fool, for the pizzas.â There was a click and Dirk Gently rang off.
Richard stood transfixed for a moment or two, wiped his forehead again, and gently replaced the phone as if it were an injured hamster. His brain began to buzz gently and suck its thumb. Lots of little synapses deep inside his cerebral cortex all joined hands and started dancing around and singing nursery rhymes. He shook his head to try and make them stop, and quickly sat down at the answering machine again.
He fought with himself over whether or not he was going to push the Play button again, and then did so anyway before he had made up his mind. Hardly fourseconds oflight orchestral music had oozed soothingly past when there came the sound of a key scratching in the lock out in the hallway.
In panic Richard thumped the Eject button, popped the cassette out, rammed it into his jeans pocket and replaced it from the pile of fresh cassettes that lay next to the machine. There was a similar pile next to his own machine at home. Susan at the office provided them -- poor, long-suffering Susan at the office. He must remember to feel sympathy for her in the morning, when he had the time and concentration for it.Suddenly, without even noticing himself doing it, he changed his mind. In a flash he popped the substitute cassette out of the machine again, replaced the one he had stolen, rammed down the rewind button and made a lunge for the sofa where, with two seconds to go before the door opened, he tried to arrange himself into a nonchalant and winning posture. On an impulse he stuck his left hand up behind his back where it might come in useful.
He was just trying to arrange his features into an expression composed inequalparts of contrition, cheerfulness and sexual allurement when the door opened and in walked Michael Wenton-Weakes.
Everything stopped.
Outside, the wind ceased. Owls halted in mid-flight. Well, maybe they did, maybe they didnât, certainly the central heating chose that moment to shut

down, unable perhaps to cope with the supernatural chill that suddenly whipped through the room.
âWhat are you doing here, Wednesday?â demanded Richard. He rose from the sofa as if levitated with anger.
Michael Wenton-Weakes was a large sad-faced man known by some people as Michael Wednesday-Week, because that was when he usually promised to have things done by. He was dressed in a suit that had been superbly well tailored when his father, the late Lord Magna, had bought it forty years previously.
Michael Wenton-Weakes came very high on the small but select list of people whom Richard thoroughly disliked.
He disliked him because he found the idea of someone who was not only privileged, but was also sorry for himself because he thought the world didnât really understand the problems of privileged people, deeply obnoxious. Michael, on the other hand, disliked Richard for the fairly simple reason that Richard disliked him and made no secret of it.
Michael gave a slow and lugubrious look back out into the hallway as Susan walked through. She stopped when she saw Richard. She put down her handbag, unwound her scarf, unbuttoned her coat, slipped it off, handed it to Michael, walked over to Richard and smacked him in the face.
âIâve been saving that up all evening,â she said furiously. âAnd donât try and pretend thatâs a bunch of flowers youâve forgotten to bring which youâre hiding behind your back. You tried that gag last time.â She turned and stalked off.
âItâs a box of chocolates I forgot this time,â said Richard glumly and held out his empty hand to her retreating back. âI climbed up the entire outside wall without them. Did I feel a fool when I got in.â
âNot very funny,â said Susan. She swept into the kitchen and sounded as if she was grinding coffee with her bare hands. For someone who always looked so neat and sweet and delicate she packed a hell of a temper.

âItâs true,â said Richard, ignoring Michael completely. âI nearly killed myself.â
âIâm not going to rise to that,â said Susan from within the kitchen. âIf you want something big and sharp thrown at you why donât you come in here and be funny?â
âI suppose it would be pointless saying Iâm sorry at this point,â Richard called out.
âYou bet,â said Susan, sweeping back out of the kitchen again. She looked at him with her eyes flashing, and actually stamped her foot.
âHonestly, Richard,â she said, âI suppose youâre going to say you forgot again. How can you have the gall to stand there with two arms, two legs and a head as if youâre a human being? This is behaviour that a bout of amoebic dysentery would be ashamed of. I bet that even the very lowest form of dysentery amoeba shows up to take its girlfriend out for a quick trot around the stomach lining once in a while. Well, I hope you had a lousy evening.â
âI did,â said Richard. âYou wouldnât have liked it. There was a horse in the bathroom, and you know how you hate that sort of thing.â
âOh, Michael,â said Susan brusquely, âdonât just stand there like a sinking pudding. Thank you very much for dinner and the concert, you were very sweet and I did enjoy listening to your troubles all evening because they were such a nice change from mine. But I think it would be best if I just found your book and pushed you out. Iâve got some serious jumping up and down and ranting to do, and I know how it upsets your delicate sensibilities.â
She retrieved her coat from him and hung it up. While he had been holding it he had seemed entirely taken up with this task and oblivious to anything else. Without it he seemed a little lost and naked and was forced to stir himself back into life. He turned his big heavy eyes back on Richard.
âRichard,â he said, âI, er, read your piece in... in Fathom. On Music and, er...â

âFractal Landscapes,â said Richard shortly. He didnât want to talk to Michael, and he certainlydidnât want to get drawn into a conversation about Michaelâs wretched magazine. Or rather, the magazine that used to be Michaelâs.
That was the precise aspect of the conversation that Richard didnât want to get drawn into.
âEr, yes. Very interesting, of course,â said Michael in his silky, over-rounded voice. âMountain shapes and tree shapes and all sorts of things. Recycled algae.â
âRecursive algorithms.â
âYes, of course. Very interesting. But so wrong, so terribly wrong. For the magazine, I mean. It is, after all, an arts review. I would never have allowed such a thing, of course. Ross has utterly ruined it. Utterly. Heâll have to go. Have to. He has no sensibilities and heâs a thief.â
âHeâs not a thief, Wednesday, thatâs absolutely absurd,â snapped Richard, instantly getting drawn into it in spite of his resolution not to. âHe had nothing to do with your getting the push whatsoever. That was your own silly fault, and you...â
There was a sharp intake of breath.
âRichard,â said Michael in his softest, quietest voice -- arguing with him was like getting tangled in parachute silk -- âI think you do not understand how important...â
âMichael,â said Susan gently but firmly, holding open the door. Michael Wenton-Weakes nodded faintly and seemed to deflate.
âYour book,â Susan added, holding out to him a small and elderly volume on the ecclesiastical architecture of Kent. He took it, murmured some slight thanks, looked about him for a moment as if heâd suddenly realised something rather

odd, then gathered himself together, nodded farewell and left.
Richard didnât appreciate quite how tense he had become till Michael left and he was suddenly able to relax. Heâd always resented the indulgent soft spot that Susan had for Michael even if she did try to disguise it by being terribly rude to him all the time. Perhaps even because of that.
âSusan, what can I say...?â he started lamely.
âYou could say âOuchâ for a start. You didnât even give me that satisfaction when I hit you, and I thought I did it rather hard. God, itâs freezing in here. Whatâs that window doing wide open?â
She went over to shut it.
âI told you. Thatâs how I got in,â said Richard.
He sounded sufficiently as if he meant it to make her look round at him in surprise.
âReally,â he said. âLike in the chocolate ads, only I forgot the box of chocolates...â He shrugged sheepishly.
She stared at him in amazement.
âWhat on earth possessed you to do that?â she said. She stuck her head out of the window and looked down. âYou could have got killed,â she said, turning back to him.
âWell, er, yes...â he said. âIt just seemed the only way to... I donât know.â He rallied himself. âYou took your key back remember?â
âYes. I got fed up with you coming and raiding my larder when you couldnât be bothered to do your own shopping. Richard, you really climbed up this wall?â
âWell, I wanted to be here when you got in.â

She shook her head in bewilderment. âIt would have been a great deal better if youâd been here when I went out. Is that why youâre wearing those filthy old clothes?â
âYes. You donât think I went to dinner at St Ceddâs like this?â
âWell, I no longer know what you consider to be rational behaviour.â She sighed and fished about in a small drawer. âHere,â she said, âif itâs going to save your life,â and handed him a couple of keys on a ring. âIâm too tired to be angry anymore. An evening of being lobbied by Michael has taken it out of me.â
âWell, Iâll never understand why you put up with him,â said Richard, going to fetch the coffee.
âI know you donât like him, but heâs very sweet and can be charming in his sad kind of way. Usually itâs very relaxing to be with someone whoâs so self- absorbed, because it doesnât make any demands on you. But heâs obsessed with the idea that I can do something about his magazine. I canât, of course. Life doesnât work like that. I do feel sorry for him, though.â
âI donât. Heâs had it very, very easy all his life. He still has it very, very easy. Heâs just had his toy taken away from him thatâs all. Itâs hardly unjust, is it?â
âItâs not a matter of whether itâs just or not. I feel sorry for him because heâs unhappy.â
âWell, of course heâs unhappy. Al Ross has turned Fathom into a really
sharp, intelligent magazine that everyone suddenly wants to read. It was just a bumbling shambles before. Its only real function was to let Michael have lunch and toady about with whoever he liked on the pretext that maybe they might like to write a little something. He hardly ever got an actual issue out. The whole thing was a sham. He pampered himself with it. I really donât find that charming or engaging. Iâm sorry, Iâm going on about it and I didnât mean to.â

Susan shrugged uneasily.
âI think you overreact,â she said, âthough I think I will have to steer clear of him if heâs going to keep on at me to do something I simply canât do. Itâs too exhausting. Anyway, listen, Iâm glad you had a lousy evening. I want to talk about what we were going to do this weekend.â
âAh,â said Richard, âwell...â
âOh, Iâd better just check the messages first.â
She walked past him to the telephone-answering machine, played the first few seconds of Gordonâs message and then suddenly ejected the cassette.
âI canât be bothered,â she said, giving it to him. âCould you just give this straight to Susan at the office tomorrow? Save her a trip. If thereâs anything important on it she can tell me.â
Richard blinked, said, âEr, yes,â and pocketed the tape, tingling with the shock of the reprieve.
âAnyway, the weekend --â said Susan, sitting down on the sofa. Richard wiped his hand over his brow. âSusan, I...â
âIâm afraid Iâve got to work. Nicolaâs sick and Iâm going to have to dep for her at the Wigmore on Friday week. Thereâs some Vivaldi and some Mozart I donât know too well, so that means a lot of extra practice this weekend, Iâm afraid. Sorry.â
âWell, in fact,â said Richard, âI have to work as well.â He sat down by her.
âI know. Gordon keeps on at me to nag you. I wish he wouldnât. Itâs none of my business and it puts me in an invidious position. Iâm tired of being pressurised by people, Richard. At least you donât do that.â
She took a sip of her coffee.

âBut Iâm sure,â she added, âthat thereâs some kind of grey area between being pressurised and being completely forgotten about that Iâd quite like to explore. Give me a hug.â
He hugged her, feeling that he was monstrously and unworthily lucky. An hour later he let himself out and discovered that the Pizza Express was closed.
Meanwhile, Michael Wenton-Weakes made his way back to his home in Chelsea. As he sat in the back of the taxi he watched the streets with a blank stare and tapped his fingers lightly against the window in a slow thoughtful rhythm.
Rap tap tap a rap tap a rap a tap.
He was one of those dangerous people who are soft, squidgy and cowlike provided they have what they want. And because he had always had what he wanted, and had seemed easily pleased with it, it had never occurred to
anybody that he was anything other than soft, squidgy and cowlike. You would have to push through a lot of soft squidgy bits in order to find a bit that didnât give when you pushed it. That was the bit that all the soft squidgy bits were there to protect.
Michael Wenton-Weakes was the younger son of Lord Magna, publisher, newspaper owner and over-indulgent father, under whose protective umbrella it had pleased Michael to run his own little magazine at a magnificent loss.Lord Magna had presided over the gradual but dignifiedandwell-respecteddecline of the publishingempire originally founded by his father, the first Lord Magna.
Michael continued to tap his knuckles lightly on the glass.
A rap tap a rap a tap.
He remembered the appalling, terrible day when his father had electrocuted himself changing a plug, and his mother, his mother, took over the business. Not only took it over but started running it with completely unexpected verve

and determination. She examined the company with a very sharp eye as to how it was being run, or walked, as she put it, and eventually even got around to looking at the accounts of Michaelâs magazine.
Tap tap tap.
Now Michael knew just enough about the business side of things to know what the figures ought to be, and he had simply assured his father that that was indeed what they were.
âCanât allow this job just to be a sinecure, you must see that, old fellow, you have to pay your way or how would it look, how would it be?â his father used to say, and Michael would nod seriously, and start thinking up the figures for next month, or whenever it was he would next manage to get an issue out.
His mother, on the other hand, was not so indulgent. Not by a lorryload.
Michael usually referred to his mother as an old battleaxe, but if she was fairly to be compared to a battleaxe it would only be to an exquisitely crafted, beautifully balanced battleaxe, with an elegant minimum of fine engraving which stopped just short of its gleaming razored edge. One swipe from such an instrument and you wouldnât even know youâd been hit until you tried to look at your watch a bit later and discovered that your arm wasnât on.
She had been waiting patiently -- or at least with the appearance of patience -- in the wings all this time, being the devoted wife, the doting but strict mother. Now someone had taken her -- to switch metaphors for a moment -- out of her scabbard and everyone was running for cover.
Including Michael.
It was her firm belief that Michael, whom she quietly adored, had been spoiled in the fullest and worst sense of the word, and she was determined, at this late stage, to stop it.
It didnât take her more than a few minutes to see that he had been simply making up the figures every month, and that the magazine was

haemorrhaging money as Michael toyed with it, all the time running up huge lunch bills, taxi accounts and staff costs that he would playfully set against fictitious taxes. The whole thing had simply got lost somewhere in the gargantuan accounts of Magna House.
She had then summoned Michael to see her.
Tap tap a rap a tappa.
âHow do you want me to treat you,â she said, âas my son or as the editor of one of my magazines? Iâm happy to do either.â
âYour magazines? Well, I am your son, but I donât see...â
âRight. Michael, I want you to look at these figures,â she said briskly, handing over a sheet of computer printout. âThe ones on the left show the actual incomings and outgoings of Fathom, the ones on the right are your own figures. Does anything strike you about them?â
âMother, I can explain, I --â
âGood,â said Lady Magna sweetly, âIâm very glad of that.â
She took the piece of paper back. âNow. Do you have any views on how the magazine should best be run in the future?â
âYes, absolutely. Very strong ones. I --â
âGood,â said Lady Magna, with a bright smile. âWell, thatâs all perfectly satisfactory, then.â
âDonât you want to hear -- ?â
âNo, thatâs all right, dear. Iâm just happy to know that you do have something to say on the matter to clear it all up. Iâm sure the new owner of Fathom will be glad to listen to whatever it is.â

âWhat?â said a stunned Michael. âYou mean youâre actually selling Fathom?â
âNo. I mean Iâve already sold it. Didnât get much for it, Iâm afraid. One pound plus a promise that you would be retained as editor for the next three issues, and after that itâs at the new ownerâs discretion.â
Michael stared, pop-eyed.
âWell, come now,â said his mother reasonably, âwe could hardly continue under the present arrangement, could we? You always agreed with your father that the job should not be a sinecure for you. And since I would have a great deal of difficulty in either believing or resisting your stories, I thought I would hand the problem on to someone with whom you could have a more objective relationship. Now, I have another appointment, Michael.â
âWell, but... who have you sold it to?â spluttered Michael.
âGordon Way.â
âGordon Way! But for heavenâs sake, Mother, heâs --â
âHeâs very anxious to be seen to patronise the arts. And I think I do mean patronise. Iâm sure youâll get on splendidly, dear. Now, if you donât mind --â
Michael stood his ground.
âIâve never heard of anything so outrageous! I --â
âDo you know, thatâs exactly what Mr Way said when I showed him these figures and then demanded that you be kept on as editor for three issues.â
Michael huffed and puffed and went red and wagged his finger, but could think of nothing more to say. Except, âWhat difference would it have made to all this if Iâd said treat me as the editor of one of your magazines?â
âWhy, dear,â said Lady Magna with her sweetest smile, âI would have called you Mr Wenton-Weakes, of course. And I wouldnât now be telling you

straighten your tie,â she added, with a tiny little gesture under her chin.
Rap tap tap rap tap tap.
âNumber seventeen, was it, guv?â
âEr... what?â said Michael, shaking his head.
âIt was seventeen you said, was it?â said the cab driver, ââCause weâre âere.â
âOh. Oh, yes, thank you,â said Michael. He climbed out and fumbled in his pocket for some money.
âTap tap tap, eh?â
âWhat?â said Michael handing over the fare.
âTap tap tap,â said the cab driver, âall the bloody way here. Got something on your mind, eh, mate?â
âMind your own bloody business,â snapped Michael savagely.âIf you say so, mate. Just thought you might be going mad or something,â said the cabbie and drove off.
Michael let himself into his house and walked through the cold hall to the dining room, turned on the overhead light and poured himself a brandy from the decanter. He took off his coat, threw it across the large mahogany dining table and pulled a chair over to the window where he sat nursing his drink and his grievances.
Tap tap tap, he went on the window.
He had sullenly remained as editor for the stipulated three issues and was then, with little ceremony, let go. A new editor was found, a certain A. K. Ross, who was young, hungry and ambitious, and he quickly turned the magazineinto a resounding success. Michael, in the meantime, had been lost and naked. There was nothing else for him.

He tapped on the window again and looked, as he frequently did, at the small table lamp that stood on the sill. It was a rather ugly, ordinary little lamp, and the only thing about it that regularly transfixed hisattention was that this was the lamp thathad electrocuted his father, and this was where he had been sitting.
The old boy was such a fool with anything technical. Michael could just see him peering with profound concentration through his half moons and suckinghis moustache as he tried to unravelthearcane complexities of a thirteen-amp plug. He had, it seemed, plugged it back in the wall without first screwing the cover back on and then tried to change the fuse in situ. From this he received the shock which had stilled his already dicky heart.
Such a simple, simple error, thought Michael, such as anyone could have made, anyone, but the consequences of it were catastrophic. Utterly catastrophic. His fatherâs death, his own loss, the rise of the appalling Ross and his disastrously successful magazine and...
Tap tap tap.
He looked at the window, at his own reflection, and at the dark shadows of the bushes on the other side of it. He looked again at the lamp. This was the very object, this the very place, and the error was such a simple one. Simple to make, simple to prevent.
The only thing that separated him from that simple moment was the invisible barrier of the months that had passed in between.
A sudden, odd calm descended on him as if something inside him had suddenly been resolved.
Tap tap tap.
Fathom was his. It wasnât meant to be a success, it was his life. His life had been taken from him, and that demanded a response.

Tap tap tap crack.
He surprised himself by suddenly punching his hand through the window and cutting himself quite badly.
CHAPTER 15
Some of the less pleasant aspects of being dead were beginning to creep up on Gordon Way as he stood in front of his âcottageâ.
It was in fact a rather large house by anybody elseâs standards but he had always wanted to have a cottage in the country and so when the time came for him finally to buy one and he discovered that he had rather more money available than he had ever seriously believed he might own, he bought a large old rectory and called it a cottage in spite of its seven bedrooms and its four acres of dank Cambridgeshire land. This did little to endear him to people who only had cottages, but then if Gordon Way had allowed his actions to be governed by what endeared him to people he wouldnât have been Gordon Way.
He wasnât, of course, Gordon Way any longer. He was the ghost of Gordon Way.
In his pocket he had the ghosts of Gordon Wayâs keys.
It was this realisation that had stopped him for a moment in his invisible tracks. The idea of walking through walls frankly revolted him. It was something he had been trying strenuously to avoid all night. He had instead been fighting to grip and grapple with every object hetouched in order to render it, and thereby himself, substantial. To enter his house, his own house, by any means other than that of opening the front door and striding in in a proprietorial manner filled him with a hurtling sense of loss.
He wished, as he stared at it, that the house was not such an extreme example of Victorian Gothic, and that the moonlight didnât play so coldly on its

narrow gabled windows and its forbidding turrets. He had joked, stupidly, when he bought it that it looked as if it ought to be haunted, not realising that one day it would be -- or by whom.
A chill of the spirit gripped him as he made his way silently up the driveway, lined by the looming shapes of yew trees that were far older than the rectory itself. It was a disturbing thought that anybody else might be scared walking up such a driveway on such a night for fear of meeting something such as him.
Behind a screen of yew trees off to his left stood the gloomy bulk of the old church, decaying now, only used in rotation with others in neighbouring villages and presided over by a vicar who was always breathless from bicycling there and dispirited by the few who were waiting for him when he arrived. Behind the steeple of the church hung the cold eye of the moon.
A glimpse of movement seemed suddenly to catch his eye, as if a figure had moved in the bushes near the house, but it was, he told himself, only his imagination, overwrought by the strain of being dead. What was there here that he could possibly be afraid of?
He continued onwards, around the angle of the wing of the rectory, towards the front door set deep within its gloomy porch wreathed in ivy. He was suddenly startled to realise that there was light coming from within the house. Electric light and also the dim flicker of firelight.
It was a moment or two before he realised that he was, of course, expected that night, though hardly in his present form. Mrs Bennett, the elderly housekeeper, would have been in to make the bed, light the fire and leave out a light supper for him.
The television, too, would be on, especially so that he could turn it off impatiently upon entering.
His footsteps failed to crunch on the gravel as he approached. Though he knew that he must fail at the door, he nevertheless could not but go there first, to try if he could open it, and only then, hidden within the shadows of the porch, would he close his eyes and let himself slip ashamedly through it.

He stepped up to the door and stopped. It was open.
Just half an inch, but it was open. His spirit fluttered in fearful surprise. How could it be open? Mrs Bennett was always so conscientious about such things. He stood uncertainly for a moment and then with difficulty exerted himself against the door. Under the little pressure he could bring to bear on it, it swung slowly and unwillingly open, its hinges groaning in protest. He stepped through and slipped along the stone-flagged hallway. A wide staircase led up into the darkness, but the doors that led off from the hallway all stood closed.
The nearest door led into the drawing room, in which the fire was burning, and from which he could hear the muted car chases of the late movie. He struggled futilely for a minute or two with its shiny brass door knob, but was forced in the end to admit a humiliating defeat, and with a sudden rage flung himself straight at the door -- and through it.
The room inside was a picture of pleasant domestic warmth. He staggered violently into it, and was unable to stop himself floating on through a small occasional table set with thick sandwiches and a Thermos flask of hot coffee, through a large overstuffed armchair, into the fire, through the thick hot brickwork and into the cold dark dining room beyond.
The connecting door back into the sitting room was also closed. Gordon fingereditnumbly and then, submitting himself to the inevitable, braced himself, and slid back through it, calmly, gently, noticing for the first time the rich internal grain of the wood.
The coziness of the room was almost too much for Gordon, and he wandered distractedly around it, unable to settle, letting the warm liveliness of the firelight play through him. Him it couldnât warm.
What, he wondered, were ghosts supposed to do all night?
He sat, uneasily, and watched the television. Soon, however, the car chases drifted peacefully to a close and there was nothing left but grey snow and

white noise, which he was unable to turn off.
He found heâd sunk too far into the chair and confused himself with bits of it as he pushed and pulled himself up. He tried to amuse himself by standing in the middle of a table, but it did little to alleviatea mood thatwas sliding inexorablyfrom despondency downwards.
Perhaps he would sleep. Perhaps.
He felt no tiredness or drowsiness, but just a deadly craving for oblivion. He passed back through the closed door and into the dark hallway, from which the wide heavy stairs led to the large gloomy bedrooms above.
Up these, emptily, he trod.
It was for nothing, he knew. If you cannot open the door to a bedroom you cannot sleep in its bed. He slid himself through the door and lifted himself on to the bed which he knew to be cold though he could not feel it. The moon seemed unable to leave him alone and shone full on him as he lay there wide- eyed and empty, unable now to remember what sleep was or how to do it.
The horror of hollowness lay on him, the horror of lying ceaselessly and forever awake at four oâclock in the morning.
He had nowhere to go, nothing to do when he got there, and no one he could go and wake up who wouldnât be utterly horrified to see him.
The worst moment had been when he had seen Richard on the road, Richardâs face frozen white in the windscreen. He saw again his face, and that of the pale figure next to him.
That had been the thing which had shaken out of him the lingering shred of warmth at the back of his mind which said that this was just a temporary problem. It seemed terrible in the night hours, but would be all right in the morning when he could see people and sort things out. He fingered the memory

of the moment in his mind and could not let it go.
He had seen Richard and Richard, he knew, had seen him. It was not going to be all right.
Usually when he felt this bad at night he popped downstairs to see what was in the fridge, so he went now. It would be more cheerful than this moonlit bedroom. He would hang around the kitchen going bump in the night.
He slid down -- and partially through -- the banisters, wafted through the kitchen door without a second thought and then devoted all his concentration and energy for about five minutes to getting the light switch on.
That gave him a real sense of achievement and he determined to celebrate with a beer.
After a minute or two of repeatedly juggling and dropping a can of Fosters he gave it up. He had not the slightest conception of how he could manage to open a ring pull, and besides the stuff was all shaken up by now -- and what was he going to do with the stuff even if he did get it open?
He didnât have a body to keep it in. He hurled the can away from him and it scuttled off under a cupboard.
He began to notice something about himself, which was the way in which his ability to grasp things seemed to grow and fade in a slow rhythm, as did his visibility.
There was an irregularity in the rhythm, though, or perhaps it was just that sometimes the effects of it would be much more pronounced than at others. That, too, seemed to vary according to a slower rhythm. Just at that moment it seemed to him that his strength was on the increase.
In a sudden fever of activity he tried to see how many things in the kitchen he could move or use or somehow get to work.

He pulled open cupboards, he yanked out drawers, scattering cutlery on the floor. He got a brief whirr out of the food processor, he knocked over the electric coffee grinder without getting it to work, he turned on the gas on the cooker hob but then couldnât light it, he savaged a loaf of bread with a carving knife. He tried stuffing lumps of bread into his mouth, but they simply fell through his mouth to the floor. A mouse appeared, but scurried from the room, its coat electric with fear.
Eventually he stopped and sat at the kitchen table, emotionally exhausted but physically numb.
How, he wondered, would people react to his death? Who would be most sorry to know that he had gone?
For a while there would be shock, then sadness, then they would adjust, and he would be a fading memory as people got on with their own lives without him, thinking that he had gone on to wherever people go. That was a thought that filled him with the most icy dread.
He had not gone. He was still here.
He sat facing one cupboard that he hadnât managed to open yet because its handle was too stiff, and that annoyed him. He grappled awkwardly with a
tin of tomatoes, then went over again to the large cupboard and attacked the handle with the tin. The door flew open and his own missing bloodstained body fell horribly forward out of it.
Gordon hadnât realised up till this point that it was possible for a ghost to faint. He realised it now and did it.
He was woken a couple of hours later by the sound of his gas cooker exploding.

CHAPTER 16
The following morning Richard woke up twice.
The first time he assumed he had made a mistake and turned over for a fitful few minutes more. The second time he sat up with a jolt as the events of the previous night insisted themselves upon him.
He went downstairs and had a moody and unsettled breakfast, during which nothing went right. He burned the toast, spilled the coffee, and realised that though heâd meant to buy some more marmalade yesterday, he hadnât. He surveyed his feeble attempt at feeding himself and thought that maybe he could at least allow himself the time to take Susan out for an amazing meal tonight, to make up for last night.
If he could persuade her to come.
There was a restaurant that Gordon had been enthusing about at great length and recommending that they try. Gordon was pretty good on restaurants -- he certainly seemed to spend enough time in them. He sat and tapped his teeth with a pencil for a couple of minutes, and then went up to his workroom and lugged a telephone directory out from under a pile of computer magazines.
LâEsprit dâEscalier.
He phoned the restaurant and tried to book a table, but when he said when he wanted it for this seemed to cause a little amusement.
âAh, non, mâsieur,â said the maÃ®tre dâ, âI regret that it is impossible. At this moment it is necessary to make reservations at least three weeks in advance. Pardon, mâsieur.â
Richard marvelled at the idea that there were people who actually knew what they wanted to do three weeks in advance, thanked the maÃ®tre dâ and rang off. Well, maybe a pizza again instead. This thought connected back to the appointment he had failed to keep last night, and after a moment curiosity overcame him and he reached for the phone book again.

Gentleman... Gentles... Gentry.
There was no Gently at all. Not a single one. He found the other directories, exceptfor the S-Z book whichhiscleaning lady continually threw away for reasons he had never yet fathomed.
There was certainly no Cjelli, or anything like it. There was no Jently, no Dgently, no Djently, no Dzently, nor anything remotely similar. He wondered about Tjently, Tsentli or Tzentli and tried Directory Enquiries, but they were out. He sat and tapped his teeth with a pencil again and watched his sofa slowly revolving on the screen of his computer.
How very peculiar it had been that it had only been hours earlier that Reg had asked after Dirk with such urgency.
If you really wanted to find someone, how would you set about it, what would you do?
He tried phoning the police, but they were out too. Well, that was that. He had done all he could do for the moment short of hiring a private detective, and he had better ways of wasting his time and money. He would run into Dirk again, as he did every few years or so.
He found it hard to believe there were really such people, anyway, as private detectives.
What sort of people were they? What did they look like, where did they work?
What sort of tie would you wear if you were a private detective? Presumably it would have to be exactly the sort of tie that people wouldnât expect private detectives to wear. Imagine having to sort out a problem like that when youâd

just got up.
Just out of curiosity as much as anything else, and because the only alternative was settling down to Anthem coding, he found himself leafing through the Yellow Pages.
Private Detectives -- see Detective Agencies.
The words looked almost odd in such a solid and businesslike context. He flipped back through the book. Dry Cleaners, Dog Breeders, Dental Technicians, Detective Agencies...
At that moment the phone rang and he answered it, a little curtly. He didnât like being interrupted.
âSomething wrong, Richard?â
âOh, hi, Kate, sorry, no. I was... my mind was elsewhere.â
Kate Anselm was another star programmer at WayForward Technologies. She was working on a long-term Artificial Intelligence project, the sort of thing that sounded like an absurd pipe dream until you heard her talking about it. Gordon needed to hear her talking about it quite regularly, partly because he was nervous about the money it was costing and partly because, well, there was little doubt that Gordon liked to hear Kate talking anyway.
âI didnât want to disturb you,â she said. âItâs just I was trying to contact Gordon and canât. Thereâs no reply from London or the cottage, or his car or his bleeper. Itâs just that for someone as obsessively in contact as Gordon itâs a bit odd. You heard heâs had a phone put in his isolation tank? True.â
âI havenât spoken to him since yesterday,â said Richard. He suddenly remembered the tape he had taken from Susanâs answering machine, and hoped to God there wasnât anything more important in Gordonâs message than ravings about rabbits. He said, âI know he was going to the cottage. Er, I donât know where he is. Have you tried --â Richard couldnât think of anywhere else to try -- â...er. Good God.â

âRichard?â
âHow extraordinary...â
âRichard, whatâs the matter?â
âNothing, Kate. Er, Iâve just read the most astounding thing.â
âReally, what are you reading?â
âWell, the telephone directory, in fact...â
âReally? I must rush out and buy one. Have the film rights gone?â
âLook, sorry, Kate, can I get back to you? I donât know where Gordon is at the moment and --â
âDonât worry. I know how it is when you canât wait to turn the next page. They always keep you guessing till the end, donât they? It must have been Zbigniew that did it. Have a good weekend.â She hung up.
Richard hung up too, and sat staring at the box advertisement lying open in front of him in the Yellow Pages.

33a Peckender St., London N1 01-354 9112
Peckender Street was only a few minutesâwalk away. Richard scribbled down the address, pulled on his coat and trotted downstairs, stopping to make another quick inspection of the sofa. There must, he thought, be something terribly obvious that he was overlooking. The sofa was jammed on a slight turn in the long narrow stairway. At this point the stairs were interrupted for a couple of yards of flat landing, which corresponded with the position of the flat directly beneath Richardâs. However, his inspection produced no new insights, and he eventually clambered on over it and out of the front door.
In Islington you can hardly hurl a brick without hitting three antique shops, an estate agent and a bookshop.
Even if you didnât actually hit them you would certainly set off their burglar alarms, which wouldnât be turned off again till after the weekend. A police car played its regular game of dodgems down Upper Street and squealed to a halt just past him. Richard crossed the road behind it.
The day was cold and bright, which he liked. He walked across the top of Islington Green, where winos get beaten up, past the site of the old Collins Music Hall which had got burnt down, and through Camden Passage where American tourists get ripped off. He browsed among the antiques for a while and looked at a pair of earrings that he thought Susan would like, but he wasnât sure. Then he wasnât sure that he liked them, got confused and gave up. He looked in at a bookshop, and on an impulse bought an anthology of Coleridgeâs poems since it was just lying there.
From here he threaded his way through the winding back streets, over the canal, past the council estates that lined the canal, through a number of smaller andsmaller squares, till finally he reached Peckender Street, which had turned out to be a good deal farther than heâd thought.
It was the sort of street where property developers in large Jaguars drive around at the weekend salivating. It was full of end-of-lease shops, Victorian industrial architecture and a short, decaying late-Georgian terrace, all just

itching to be pulled down so that sturdy young concrete boxes could sprout in their places. Estate agents roamed the area in hungry packs, eyeing each other warily, their clipboards on a hair trigger.
Number 33, when he eventually found it neatly sandwiched between 37 and 45, was in a poorish state of repair, but no worse than most of the rest.
The ground floor was a dusty travel agentâs whose window was cracked and whose faded BOAC posters were probably now quite valuable. The doorway next to the shop had been painted bright red, not well, but at least recently. A push button next to the door said, in neatly pencilled lettering, âDominique, French lessons, 3me Floorâ.
The most striking feature of the door, however, was the bold and shiny brass plaque fixed in the dead centre of it, on which was engraved the legend âDirk Gentlyâs Holistic Detective Agencyâ.
Nothing else. It looked brand new -- even the screws that held it in place were still shiny.
The door opened to Richardâs push and he peered inside.
He saw a short and musty hallway which contained little but the stairway that led up from it. A door at the back of the hall showed little sign of having been opened in recent years, and had stacks of old metal shelving, a fish tank and the carcass of a bike piled up against it. Everything else, thewalls, the floor,the stairs themselves, and as much of the rear door as could be got at, had been painted grey in an attempt to smarten it up cheaply, but it was all now badly scuffed, and little cups of fungus were peeking from a damp stain near the ceiling.
The sounds of angry voices reached him, and as he started up the stairs he was able to disentangle the noises of two entirely separate but heated arguments that were going on somewhere above him.
One ended abruptly -- or at least half of it did -- as an angry overweight man came clattering down the stairs pulling his raincoat collar straight. The

other half of the argument continued in a torrent of aggrieved French from high above them. The man pushed past Richard, said, âSave your money, mate, itâs a complete washout,â and disappeared out into the chilly morning.
The other argument was more muffled. As Richard reached the first corridor
a door slammed somewhere and brought that too to an end. He looked into the nearest open doorway.
It led into a small ante-office. The other, inner door leading from it was firmly closed. A youngish plump-faced girl in a cheap blue coat was pulling sticks of make-up and boxes of Kleenex out of her desk drawer and thrusting them into her bag.
âIs this the detective agency?â Richard asked her tentatively. The girl nodded, biting her lip and keeping her head down. âAnd is Mr Gently in?â
âHe may be,â she said, throwing back her hair, which was too curly for throwing back properly, âand then again he may not be. I am not in a position to tell. It is not my business to know of his whereabouts. His whereabouts are, as of now, entirely his own business.â
She retrieved her last pot of nail varnish and tried to slam the drawer shut. A fat book sitting upright in the drawer prevented it from closing. She tried to slam the drawer again, without success. She picked up the book, ripped out a clump of pages and replaced it. This time she was able to slam the drawer with ease.
âAre you his secretary?â asked Richard.
âI am his ex-secretary and I intend to stay that way,â she said, firmly snapping her bag shut. âIf he intends to spend his money on stupid expensive brass plaques rather than on paying me, then let him. But I wonât stay to
stand for it, thank you very much. Good for business, my foot. Answering the phones properly is good for business and Iâd like to see his fancy brass plaque

do that. If youâll excuse me Iâd like to storm out, please.â Richard stood aside, and out she stormed.
âAnd good riddance!â shouted a voice from the inner office. A phone rang and was picked up immediately.
âYes?â answered the voice from the inner office, testly. The girl popped back for her scarf, but quietly, so her ex-employer wouldnât hear. Then she was finally gone.
âYes, Dirk Gentlyâs Holistic Detective Agency. How can we be of help to you?â
The torrent of French from upstairs had ceased. A kind of tense calm descended.
Inside, the voice said,âThatâs right, Mrs Sunderland, messy divorces are our particular speciality.â
There was a pause.
âYes, thank you, Mrs Sunderland, not quite that messy.â Down went the phone again, to be replaced instantly by the ringing of another one.
Richard looked around the grim little office. There was very little in it. A battered chipboard veneer desk, an old grey filing cabinet and a dark green tin wastepaper bin. On the wall was a Duran Duran poster on which someone had scrawled in fat red felt tip, âTake this down pleaseâ.
Beneath that another hand had scrawled, âNoâ.
Beneath that again the first hand had written, âI insist that you take it downâ. Beneath that the second hand had written, âWonât!â
Beneath that -- âYouâre firedâ.

Beneath that -- âGood!â
And there the matter appeared to have rested.
He knocked on the inner door, but was not answered. Instead the voice continued, âIâm very glad you asked me that, Mrs Rawlinson. The term âholisticâ refers to my conviction that what we are concerned with here is the fundamental interconnectedness of all things. I do not concern myself with such petty things as fingerprint powder, telltale pieces of pocket fluff and inane footprints. I see the solution to each problem as being detectable in the pattern and web of the whole. The connections between causes and effects are often much more subtle and complex than we with our rough and ready understanding of the physical world might naturally suppose, Mrs Rawlinson.
âLet me give you an example. If you go to an acupuncturist with toothache he sticks a needle instead into your thigh. Do you know why he does that, Mrs Rawlinson?
âNo, neither do I, Mrs Rawlinson, but we intend to find out. A pleasure talking to you, Mrs Rawlinson. Goodbye.â
Another phone was ringing as he put this one down. Richard eased the door open and looked in.
It was the same Svlad, or Dirk, Cjelli. Looking a little rounder about the middle, a little looser and redder about the eyes and the neck, but it was still essentially the same face that he remembered most vividly smiling a grim smile as its owner climbed into the back of one of the Black Marias of the Cambridgeshire constabulary, eight years previously.
He wore a heavy old light brown suit which looked as if it has been worn extensively for bramble hacking expeditions in some distant and better past, a red checked shirt which failed entirely to harmonise with the suit, and a green striped tie which refused to speak to either of them. He also wore thick metal- rimmed spectacles, which probably accounted at least in part for his dress

sense.
âAh, Mrs Bluthall, how thoroughly uplifting to hear from you,â he was saying. âI was so distressed to learn that Miss Tiddles has passed over. This is desperate news indeed. And yet, and yet... Should we allow black despair to hide from us the fairer light in which your blessed moggy now forever dwells?
âI think not. Hark. I think I hear Miss Tiddles miaowing even now. She calls to you, Mrs Bluthall. She says she is content, she is at peace. She says sheâll be even more at peace when youâve paid some bill or other. Does that ring a bell with you at all, Mrs Bluthall? Come to think of it I think I sent you one myself not three months ago. I wonder if it can be that which is disturbing her eternal rest.â
Dirk beckoned Richard in with a brisk wave and then motioned him to pass the crumpled pack of French cigarettes that was sitting just out of his reach.
âSunday night, then, Mrs Bluthall, Sunday night at eight-thirty. You know the address. Yes, Iâm sure Miss Tiddles will appear, as Iâm sure will your cheque book. Till then, Mrs Bluthall, till then.â
Another phone was already ringing as he got rid of Mrs Bluthall. He grabbed at it, lighting his crumpled cigarette at the same time.
âAh, Mrs Sauskind,â he said in answer to the caller, âmy oldest and may I say most valued client. Good day to you, Mrs Sauskind, good day. Sadly, no sign as yet of young Roderick, Iâm afraid, but the search is intensifying as it
moves into what I am confident are its closing stages, and I am sanguine that within mere days from todayâs date we will have the young rascal permanently restored to your arms and mewing prettily, ah yes the bill, I was wondering if you had received it.â
Dirkâs crumpled cigarette turned out to be too crumpled to smoke, so he hooked the phone on his shoulder and poked around in the packet for another, but it was empty.

He rummaged on his desk for a piece of paper and a stub of pencil and wrote a note which he passed to Richard.
âYes, Mrs Sauskind,â he assured the telephone, âI am listening with the utmost attention.â
The note said âTell secretary get cigsâ.
âYes,â continued Dirk into the phone, âbut as I have endeavoured to explain to you, Mrs Sauskind, over the seven years of our acquaintance, I incline to the quantum mechanical view in this matter. My theory is that your cat is not lost, but that his waveform has temporarily collapsed and must be restored. SchrÃ¶dinger. Planck. And so on.â
Richard wrote on the note âYou havenât got secretaryâ and pushed it back.
Dirk considered this for a while, then wrote âDamn and blastâ on the paper and pushed it to Richard again.
âI grant you, Mrs Sauskind,â continued Dirk blithely, âthat nineteen years is, shall we say, a distinguished age for a cat to reach, yet can we allow ourselves to believe that a cat such as Roderick has not reached it?
âAnd should we now in the autumn of his years abandon him to his fate? This surely is the time that he most needs the support of our continuing investigations. This is the time that we should redouble our efforts, and with your permission, Mrs Sauskind, that is what I intend to do. Imagine, Mrs Sauskind, how you would face him if you had not done this simple thing for him.â
Richard fidgeted with the note, shrugged to himself, and wrote âIâll get themâ on it and passed it back once more.
Dirk shook his head in admonition, then wrote âI couldnât possibly that would be most kindâ. As soon as Richard had read this, Dirk took the note back and added âGet money from secretaryâ to it.

Richard looked at the paper thoughtfully, took the pencil and put a tick next to where hehad previously written âYou havenât got secretaryâ. He pushed the paper back across the table to Dirk, who merely glanced at it and ticked âI couldnât possibly that would be most kindâ.
âWell, perhaps,â continued Dirk to Mrs Sauskind, âyou could just run over any of the areas in the bill that cause you difficulty. Just the broader areas.â
Richard let himself out.
Running down the stairs, he passed a young hopeful in a denim jacket and close-cropped hair peering anxiously up the stairwell.
âAny good, mate?â he said to Richard.
âAmazing,â murmured Richard, âjust amazing.â
He found a nearby newsagentâs and picked up a couple of packets of Disque Bleu for Dirk, and a copy of the new edition of Personal Computer World, which had a picture of Gordon Way on the front.
âPity about him, isnât it?â said the newsagent.
âWhat? Oh, er... yes,â said Richard. He often thought the same himself, but was surprised to find his feelings so widely echoed. He picked up a Guardian as well, paid and left.
Dirk was still on the phone with his feet on the table when Richard returned, and it was clear that he was relaxing into his negotiations.âYes, expenses were, well, expensive in the Bahamas, Mrs Sauskind, it is in the nature of expenses to be so. Hence the name.â He took the proffered packets of cigarettes, seemed disappointed there were only two, but briefly raised his eyebrows to Richard in acknowledgement of the favour he had done him, and then waved him to a chair.
The sounds of an argument conducted partly in French drifted down from the floor above.

âOf course I will explain to you again why the trip to the Bahamas was so vitally necessary,â said Dirk Gently soothingly. âNothing could give me greater pleasure. I believe, as you know, Mrs Sauskind, in the fundamentalinterconnectedness of all things. Furthermore I have plotted and triangulated the vectors of the interconnectedness of all things and traced them to a beach in Bermuda which it is therefore necessary for me to visit from time to time in the course of my investigations. I wish it were not the
case, since, sadly, I am allergic to both the sun and rum punches, but then we all have our crosses to bear, do we not, Mrs Sauskind?â
A babble seemed to break out from the telephone.
âYou sadden me, Mrs Sauskind. I wish I could find it in my heart to tell you that I find your scepticism rewarding and invigorating, but with the best will in the world I cannot. I am drained by it, Mrs Sauskind, drained. I think you will find an item in the bill to that effect. Let me see.â
He picked up a flimsy carbon copy lying near him.
ââDetecting and triangulating the vectors of interconnectedness of all things, one hundred and fifty pounds.â Weâve dealt with that.
ââTracing same to beach on Bahamas, fare and accommodation.â A mere fifteen hundred.The accommodation was, of course, distressingly modest.
âAh yes, here we are, âStruggling on in the face of draining scepticism from client, drinks -- three hundred and twenty-seven pounds fifty.ââWould that I did not have to make such charges, my dear Mrs Sauskind, would that the occasion did not continually arise. Not believing in my methods only makes my job more difficult, Mrs Sauskind, and hence, regrettably, more expensive.â
Upstairs, the sounds of argument were becoming more heated by the moment. The French voice seemed to be verging on hysteria.
âI do appreciate, Mrs Sauskind,â continued Dirk, âthat the cost of the

investigation has strayed somewhat from the original estimate, but I am sure that you will in your turn appreciate that a job which takes seven years to do must clearly be more difficult than one that can be pulled off in an afternoon and must therefore be charged at a higher rate. I have continually to revise my estimate of how difficult the task is in the light of how difficult it has so far proved to be.â
The babble from the phone became more frantic.
âMy dear Mrs Sauskind -- or may I call you Joyce? Very well then. My dear Mrs Sauskind, let me say this. Do not worry yourself about this bill, do not let it alarm or discomfit you. Do not, I beg you, let it become a source of anxiety to you. Just grit your teeth and pay it.â
He pulled his feet down off the table and leaned forward over the desk, inching the telephone receiver inexorably back towards its cradle.
âAs always, the very greatest pleasure to speak with you, Mrs Sauskind. For now, goodbye.â
He at last put down the receiver, picked it up again, and dropped it for the moment into the waste basket.
âMy dear Richard MacDuff,â he said, producing a large flat box from under his desk and pushing it across the table at him, âyour pizza.â
Richard started back in astonishment.
âEr, no thanks,â he said, âI had breakfast. Please. You have it.â
Dirk shrugged. âI told them youâd pop in and settle up over the weekend,â he said. âWelcome, by the way, to my offices.â
He waved a vague hand around the tatty surroundings.
âThe light works,â he said, indicating the window, âthe gravity works,â he said, dropping a pencil on the floor. âAnything else we have to take our chances

with.â
Richard cleared his throat. âWhat,â he said, âis this?â
âWhat is what?â
âThis,â exclaimed Richard, âall this. You appear to have a Holistic Detective Agency and I donât even know what one is.â
âI provide a service that is unique in this world,â said Dirk. âThe term âholisticâ refers to my conviction that what we are concerned with here is the fundamental interconnectedness of all --â
âYes, I got that bit earlier,â said Richard. âI have to say that it sounded a bit like an excuse for exploiting gullible old ladies.â
âExploiting?â asked Dirk. âWell, I suppose it would be if anybody ever paid me, but I do assure you, my dear Richard, that there never seems to be the remotest danger of that. I live in what are known as hopes. I hope for fascinating and remunerative cases, my secretary hopes that I will pay her, her landlord hopes that she will produce some rent, the Electricity Board hopes that he will settle their bill, and so on. I find it a wonderfully optimistic way of life.
âMeanwhile I give a lot of charming and silly old ladies something to be happily cross about and virtually guarantee the freedom of their cats. Is there, you ask -- and I put the question for you because I know you know I hate to be interrupted -- is there a single case that exercises the tiniest part of my intellect, which, as you hardly need me to tell you, is prodigious? No. But do I despair? Am I downcast? Yes. Until,â he added, âtoday.â
âOh, well, Iâm glad of that,â said Richard, âbut what was all that rubbish about cats and quantum mechanics?â
With a sigh Dirk flipped up the lid of the pizza with a single flick of practised fingers. He surveyed the cold round thing with a kind of sadness and then tore off a hunk of it. Pieces of pepperoni and anchovy scattered over his desk.

âI am sure, Richard,â he said, âthat you are familiar with the notion of SchrÃ¶dingerâs Cat,â and he stuffed the larger part of the hunk into his mouth.
âOf course,â said Richard. âWell, reasonably familiar.â âWhat is it?â said Dirk through a mouthful.
Richard shifted irritably in his seat. âItâs an illustration,â he said, âof the principle that at a quantum level all events are governed by probabilities...â
âAt a quantum level, and therefore at all levels,â interrupted Dirk. âThough at any level higher than the subatomic the cumulative effect of those probabilities is, in the normal course of events, indistinguishable from the effect of hard and fast physical laws. Continue.â
He put some more cold pizza into his face.
Richard reflected that Dirkâs was a face into which too much had already been put. What with that and the amount he talked, the traffic through his mouth was almost incessant. His ears, on the other hand, remained almost totally unused in normal conversation.
It occurred to Richard that if Lamarck had been right and you were to take a line through this behaviour for several generations, the chances were that some radical replumbing of the interior of the skull would eventually take place.
Richard continued, âNot only are quantum level events governed by probabilities, but those probabilities arenât even resolved into actual events
until they are measured. Or to use a phrase that I just heard you use in a rather bizarre context, the act of measurement collapses the probability waveform. Up until that point all the possible courses of action open to, say, an electron, coexist as probability waveforms. Nothing is decided. Until itâs measured.â
Dirk nodded. âMore or less,â he said, taking another mouthful. âBut what of the cat?â

Richard decided that there was only one way to avoid having to watch Dirk eat his way through all the rest of the pizza, and that was to eat the rest himself. He rolled it up and took a token nibble off the end. It was rather good. He took another bite.
Dirk watched this with startled dismay.
âSo,â said Richard, âthe idea behind SchrÃ¶dingerâs Cat was to try and imagine a way in which the effects of probabilistic behaviour at a quantum level could be considered at a macroscopic level. Or letâs say an everyday level.â
âYes, letâs,â said Dirk, regarding the rest of the pizza with a stricken look. Richard took another bite and continued cheerfully.
âSo you imagine that you take a cat and put it in a box that you can seal completely. Also in the box you put a small lump of radioactive material, and a phial of poison gas. You arrange it so that within a given period of time there is an exactly fifty-fifty chance that an atom in the radioactive lump
will decay and emit an electron. If it does decay then it triggers the release of the gas and kills the cat. If it doesnât, the cat lives. Fifty-fifty. Depending on the fifty-fifty chance that a single atom does or does not decay.
âThe point as I understand it is this: since the decay of a single atom is a quantum level event that wouldnât be resolved either way until it was observed, and since you donât make the observation until you open the box and see whether the cat is alive or dead, then thereâs a rather extraordinary consequence.
âUntil you do open the box the cat itself exists in an indeterminate state. The possibility that it is alive, and the possibility that it is dead, are two different
waveforms superimposed on each other inside the box. SchrÃ¶dinger put forward this idea to illustrate what he thought was absurd about quantum theory.â
Dirk got up and padded over to the window, probably not so much for the meagre view it afforded over an old warehouse on which an alternative

comedian was lavishing his vast lager commercial fees developing into luxury apartments, as for the lack of view it afforded of the last piece of pizza disappearing.
âExactly,â said Dirk, âbravo!â
âBut whatâs all that got to do with this -- this Detective Agency?ââOh, that. Well, some researchers were once conducting such an experiment, but when they opened up the box, the cat was neither alive nor dead but was in fact completely missing, and they called me in to investigate. I was able to
deduce that nothing very dramatic had happened. The cat had merely got fed up with being repeatedly locked up in a box and occasionally gassed and had taken the first opportunity to hoof it through the window. It was for me the work of a moment to set a saucer of milk by the window and call âBerniceâ in an enticing voice -- the catâs name was Bernice, you understand --â
âNow, wait a minute --â said Richard.
â -- and the cat was soon restored. A simple enough matter, but it seemed to create quite an impression in certain circles, and soon one thing led to another as they do and it all culminated in the thriving career you see before you.â
âWait a minute, wait a minute,â insisted Richard, slapping the table. âYes?â enquired Dirk innocently.
âNow, what are you talking about, Dirk?â
âYou have a problem with what I have told you?â
âWell, I hardly know where to begin,â protested Richard. âAll right. You said that some people were performing the experiment. Thatâs nonsense. SchrÃ¶dingerâs Cat isnât a real experiment. Itâs just an illustration for arguing about the idea. Itâs not something youâd actually do.â
Dirk was watching him with odd attention.

âOh, really?â he said at last. âAnd why not?â
âWell, thereâs nothing you can test. The whole point of the idea is to think about what happens before you make your observation. You canât know whatâs going on inside the box without looking, and the very instant you look the wave packet collapses and the probabilities resolve. Itâs self-defeating. Itâs completely purposeless.â
âYou are, of course, perfectly correct as far as you go,â replied Dirk, returning to his seat. He drew a cigarette out of the packet, tapped it several times on the desk, and leant across the desk and pointed the filter at Richard.
âBut think about this,â he continued. âSupposing you were to introducea psychic, someone with clairvoyantpowers, into the experiment -- someone who is able to divine what state of health the cat is in without opening the box. Someone who has, perhaps, a certain eerie sympathy with cats. What then? Might that furnish us with an additional insight into the problem of quantum physics?â
âIs that what they wanted to do?â
âItâs what they did.â
âDirk, this is complete nonsense.â
Dirk raised his eyebrows challengingly.
âAll right, all right,â said Richard, holding up his palms, âletâs just follow it through. Even if I accepted -- which I donât for one second -- that there was any basis at all for clairvoyance, it wouldnât alter the fundamental undoableness of the experiment. As I said, the whole thing turns on what happens inside the box before itâs observed. It doesnât matter how you observe it, whether you look into the box with your eyes or -- well, with your mind, if you insist. If clairvoyance works, then itâs just another way of looking into the box, and if it doesnât then of course itâs irrelevant.â
âIt might depend, of course, on the view you take of clairvoyance...â

âOh yes? And what view do you take of clairvoyance? I should be very interested to know, given your history.â
Dirk tapped the cigarette on the desk again and looked narrowly at Richard.
There was a deep and prolonged silence, disturbed only by the sound of distant crying in French.
âI take the view I have always taken,â said Dirk eventually. âWhich is?â
âThat I am not clairvoyant.â
âReally,â said Richard. âThen what about the exam papers?â
The eyes of Dirk Gently darkened at the mention of this subject.
âA coincidence,â he said, in a low, savage voice, âa strange and chilling coincidence, but none the less a coincidence. One, I might add, which caused meto spend a considerable timein prison. Coincidences can be frightening and dangerous things.â
Dirk gave Richard another of his long appraising looks.
âI have been watching you carefully,â he said. âYou seem to be extremely relaxed for a man in your position.â
This seemed to Richard to be an odd remark, and he tried to make sense of it for a moment. Then the light dawned, and it was an aggravating light.
âGood heavens,â he said, âhe hasnât got to you as well, has he?â This remark seemed to puzzle Dirk in return.
âWho hasnât got to me?â he said.

âGordon. No, obviously not. Gordon Way. He has this habit of trying to get other people to bring pressure on me to get on with what he sees as important work. I thought for a moment -- oh, never mind. What did you mean, then?â
âAh. Gordon Way has this habit, has he?â
âYes. I donât like it. Why?â
Dirk looked long and hard at Richard, tapping a pencil lightly on the desk.
Then he leaned back in his chair and said as follows: âThe body of Gordon Way was discovered before dawn this morning. He had been shot, strangled, and then his house was set on fire. Police are working on the theory that he was not actually shot in the house because no shotgun pellets were discovered there other than those in the body.
âHowever, pellets were found near to Mr Wayâs Mercedes 500 SEC, which was found abandoned about three miles from his house. This suggests that the body was moved after the murder. Furthermore the doctor who examined the body is of the opinion that Mr Way was in fact strangled after he was shot, which seems to suggest a certain confusion in the mind of the killer.
âBy a startling coincidence it appears that the police last night had occasion to interview a very confused-seeming gentleman who said that he was suffering from some kind of guilt complex about having just run over his employer.
âThat man was a Mr Richard MacDuff, and his employer was the
deceased, Mr Gordon Way. It has further been suggested that Mr Richard MacDuff is one of the two people most likely to benefit from Mr Wayâs death, since WayForward Technologies would almost certainly pass at least partly into his hands. The other person is his only living relative, Miss Susan Way,
into whose flat Mr Richard MacDuff was observed to break last night. The police donât know that bit, of course. Nor, if we can help it, will they. However, any relationship between the two of them will naturally come under close scrutiny. The news reports on the radio say that they are urgently

seeking Mr MacDuff, who they believe will be able to help them with their enquiries, but the tone of voice says that heâs clearly guilty as hell.âMy scale of charges is as follows: two hundred pounds a day, plus expenses. Expenses are not negotiable and will sometimes strike those who do not understand these matters as somewhat tangential. They are all necessary and are, as I say, not negotiable. Am I hired?â
âSorry,â said Richard, nodding slightly. âWould you start that again?â
CHAPTER 17
The Electric Monk hardly knew what to believe any more.
He had been through a bewildering number of belief systems in the previous few hours, most of which had failed to provide him with the long-term spiritual solace that it washis boundenprogramming eternally to seek.
He was fed up. Frankly. And tired. And dispirited.
And furthermore, which caught him by surprise, he rather missed his horse. A dull and menial creature, to be sure, and as such hardly worthy of the preoccupation of one whose mind was destined forever to concern itself with higher things beyond the understanding of a simple horse, but nevertheless he missed it.
He wanted to sit on it. He wanted to pat it. He wanted to feel that it didnât understand.
He wondered where it was.
He dangled his feet disconsolately from the branch of the tree in which he had spent the night. He had climbed it in pursuit of some wild fantastic dream and then had got stuck and had to stay there till the morning.

Even now, by daylight, he wasnât certain how he was going to get down. He came for a moment perilously close to believing that he could fly, but a quick- thinking error-checking protocol cut in and told him not to be so silly.
It was a problem though.
Whatever burning fire of faith had borne him, inspired on wings of hope, upwards through the branches of the tree in the magic hours of night, had not also provided him with instructions on how to get back down again when, like altogether too many of these burning fiery night-time faiths, it had deserted him in the morning.
And speaking -- or rather thinking -- of burning fiery things, there had been a major burning fiery thing a little distance from here in the early pre-dawn hours.
It lay, he thought, in the direction from which he himself had come when he had been drawn by a deep spiritual compulsion towards this inconveniently high but otherwise embarrassingly ordinary tree. He had longed to go and worship at the fire, to pledge himself eternally to its holy glare, but while he had been struggling hopelessly to find a way downwards through the branches, fire engines had arrived and put the divine radiance out, and that had been another creed out of the window.
The sun had been up for some hours now, and though he had occupied the time as best as he could, believing in clouds, believing in twigs, believing in a peculiar form of flying beetle, he believed now that he was fed up, and was utterly convinced, furthermore, that he was getting hungry.
He wished heâd taken the precaution of providing himself with some food from the dwelling place he had visited in the night, to which he had carried his sacred burden for entombment in the holy broom cupboard, but he had left in the grip of a white passion, believing that such mundane matters as food were of no consequence, that the tree would provide.
Well, it had provided. It had provided twigs.

Monks did not eat twigs.
In fact, now he came to think of it, he felt a little uncomfortable about some of the things he had believed last night and had found some of the results a little confusing. He had been quite clearly instructed to âshoot offâ and had felt strangely compelled to obey but perhaps he had made a mistake in acting so precipitately on an instruction given in a language he had learned only two minutes before. Certainly the reaction of the person he had shot off at had seemed a little extreme.In his own world when people were shot at like that they came back next week for another episode, but he didnât think this person would be doing that.
A gust of wind blew through the tree, making it sway giddily. He climbed down a little way. The first part was reasonably easy, since the branches were all fairly close together. It was the last bit that appeared to be an insuperable obstacle -- a sheer drop which could cause him severe internal damage or rupture and might in turn cause him to start believing things that were seriously strange.
The sound of voices over in a distant corner of the field suddenly caught his attention. A lorry had pulled up by the side of the road. He watched carefully for a moment, but couldnât see anything particular to believe in and so returned to his introspection.
There was, he remembered, an odd function call he had had last night, which he hadnât encountered before, but he had a feeling that it might be something heâd heard of called remorse. He hadnât felt at all comfortable about the way the person he had shot at had just lain there, and after initially walking away the Monk had returned to have another look. There was definitely an expression on the personâs face which seemed to suggest that something was up, that this didnât fit in with the scheme of things. The Monk worried that he might have badly spoiled his evening.
Still, he reflected, so long as you did what you believed to be right, that was the main thing.

The next thing he had believed to be right was that having spoiled this personâs evening he should at least convey him to his home, and a quick search of his pockets had produced an address, some maps and some keys. The trip had been an arduous one, but he had been sustained on the way by his faith.
The word âbathroomâ floated unexpectedly across the field.
He looked up again at the lorry in the distant comer. There was a man in a dark blue uniform explaining something to a man in rough working clothes, who seemed a little disgruntled about whatever it was. The words âuntil we trace the ownerâ and âcompletely batty, of courseâ were gusted over on the wind. The man in the working clothes clearly agreed to accept the situation, but with bad grace.
A few moments later, a horse was led out of the back of the lorry and into the field. The Monk blinked. His circuits thrilled and surged with astonishment. Now here at last was something he could believe in, a truly miraculous event, a reward at last for his unstinting if rather promiscuous devotion.
The horse walked with a patient, uncomplaining gait. It had long grown used to being wherever it was put, but for once it felt it didnât mind this. Here, it thought, was a pleasant field. Here was grass. Here was a hedge it could look at. There was enough space that it could go for a trot later on if it felt the urge. The humans drove off and left it to its own devices, to which it was quite content to be left. It went for a little amble, and then, just for the hell of it, stopped ambling. It could do what it liked.
What pleasure.
What very great and unaccustomed pleasure.
It slowly surveyed the whole field, and then decided to plan out a nice relaxed day for itself. A little trot later on, it thought, maybe around threeish. After that a bit of a lie down over on the east side of the field where the grass was thicker. It looked like a suitable spot to think about supper in.
Lunch, it rather fancied, could be taken at the south end of the field where a

small stream ran. Lunch by a stream, for heavenâs sake. This was bliss.
It also quite liked the notion of spending half an hour walking alternately a little bit to the left and then a little bit to the right, for no apparent reason. It didnât know whether the time between two and three would be best spent swishing its tail or mulling things over.
Of course, it could always do both, if it so wished, and go for its trot a little later. And it had just spotted what looked like a fine piece of hedge for watching things over, and that would easily while away a pleasant pre-prandial hour or two.
Good.
An excellent plan.
And the best thing about it was that having made it the horse could now completely and utterly ignore it. It went instead for a leisurely stand under the only tree in the field.
From out of its branches the Electric Monk dropped on to the horseâs back, with a cry which sounded suspiciously like âGeronimoâ.
CHAPTER 18
Dirk Gently briefly ran over the salient facts once more while Richard MacDuffâs world crashed slowly and silently into a dark, freezing sea which he hadnât even known was there, waiting inches beneath his feet. When Dirk had finished for the second time the room fell quiet while Richard stared fixedly at his face.
âWhere did you hear this?â said Richard at last.
âThe radio,â said Dirk, with a slight shrug, âat least the main points. Itâs all

over the news of course. The details? Well, discreet enquiries among contacts here and there. There are one or two people I got to know at Cambridge police station, for reasons which may occur to you.â
âI donât even know whether to believe you,â said Richard quietly. âMay I use the phone?â
Dirk courteously picked a telephone receiver out of the wastepaper bin and handed it to him. Richard dialled Susanâs number.
The phone was answered almost immediately and a frightened voice said, âHello?â
âSusan, itâs Ri --â
âRichard! Where are you? For Godâs sake, where are you? Are you all right?â
âDonât tell her where you are,â said Dirk.
âSusan, whatâs happened?â
âDonât you -- ?â
âSomebody told me that somethingâs happened to Gordon, but...â
âSomethingâs happened-- ? Heâs dead, Richard, heâs been murdered --â
âHang up,â said Dirk.
âSusan, listen. I --â
âHang up,â repeated Dirk, and then leaned forward to the phone and cut him off.
âThe police will probably have a trace on the line,â he explained. He took the receiver and chucked it back in the bin.

âBut I have to go to the police,â Richard exclaimed.
âGo to the police?â
âWhat else can I do? I have to go to the police and tell them that it wasnât me.â
âTell them that it wasnât you?â said Dirk incredulously. âWell I expect that will probably make it all right, then. Pity Dr Crippen didnât think of that. Would have saved him a lot of bother.â
âYes, but he was guilty!â
âYes, so it would appear. And so it would appear, at the moment, are you.â âBut I didnât do it, for Godâs sake!â
âYou are talking to someone who has spent time in prison for something he didnât do, remember. I told you that coincidences are strange and dangerous things. Believe me, it is a great deal better to find cast-iron proof that youâre innocent, than to languish in a cell hoping that the police -- who already think youâre guilty -- will find it for you.â
âI canât think straight,â said Richard, with his hand to his forehead. âJust stop for a moment and let me think this out --â
âIf I may --â
âLet me think -- !â
Dirk shrugged and turned his attention back to his cigarette, which seemed to be bothering him.
âItâs no good,â said Richard shaking his head after a few moments, âI canât take it in. Itâs like trying to do trigonometry when someoneâs kicking your head. OK, tell me what you think I should do.â
âHypnotism.â

âWhat?â
âIt is hardly surprising in the circumstances that you should be unable to gather your thoughts clearly. However, it is vital that somebody gathers them. It will be much simpler for both of us if you will allow me to hypnotise you. I strongly suspect that there is a very great deal of information jumbled up in your head that will not emerge while you are shaking it up so -- that might not emerge at all because you do not realise its significance. With your permission we can shortcut all that.â
âWell, thatâs decided then,â said Richard, standing up, âIâm going to the police.â
âVery well,â said Dirk, leaning back and spreading his palms on the desk, âI wish you the very best of luck. Perhaps on your way out you would be kind enough to ask my secretary to get me some matches.â
âYou havenât got a secretary,â said Richard, and left.
Dirk sat and brooded for a few seconds, made a valiant but vain attempt to fold the sadly empty pizza box into the wastepaper bin, and then went to look in the cupboard for a metronome.
Richard emerged blinking into the daylight. He stood on the top step rocking slightly, then plunged off down the street with an odd kind of dancing walk which reflected the whirling dance of his mind. On the one hand he simply couldnât believe that the evidence wouldnât show perfectly clearly that he couldnât have committed the murder; on the other hand he had to admit that it all looked remarkably odd.
He found it impossible to think clearly or rationally about it. The idea that Gordon had been murdered kept blowing up in his mind and throwing all other thoughts into total confusion and disruption.
It occurred to him for a moment that whoever did it must have been a damn fast shot to get the trigger pulled beforebeing totally overwhelmed by

waves of guilt, but instantly he regretted the thought. In fact he was a little appalled by the general quality of the thoughts that sprang into his mind. They seemed inappropriate and unworthy and mostly had to do with how it would affect his projects in the company.He looked about inside himself for any feeling of great sorrow or regret, and assumed that it must be there somewhere, probably hiding behind the huge wall of shock.
He arrived back within sight of Islington Green, hardly noticing the distance he had walked. The sudden sight of the police squad car parked outside his house hit him like a hammer and he swung on his heel and stared with furious concentration at the menu displayed in the window of a Greek restaurant.
âDolmades,â he thought, frantically.
âSouvlaki,â he thought.
âA small spicy Greek sausage,â passed hectically through his mind. He tried to reconstruct the scene in his mindâs eye without turning round. There had been a policeman standing watching the street, and as far as he could recall from the brief glance he had, it looked as if the side door of the building which led up to his flat was standing open.
The police were in his flat. In his flat. Fassolia Plaki! A filling bowl of haricot beans cooked in a tomato and vegetable sauce!
He tried to shift his eyes sideways and back over his shoulder. The policeman was looking at him. He yanked his eyes back to the menu and tried to fill his mind with finely ground meat mixed with potato, breadcrumbs, onions and herbs rolled into small balls and fried. The policeman must have recognised him and was at that very moment dashing across the road to grab him and lug him off in a Black Maria just as they had done to Dirk all those years ago in Cambridge.
He braced his shoulders against the shock, but no hand came to grab him. He glanced back again, but the policeman was looking unconcernedly in another direction. Stifado.

It was very apparent to him that his behaviour was not that of one who was about to go and hand himself in to the police.
So what else was he to do?
Trying in a stiff, awkward way to walk naturally, he yanked himself away from the window, strolled tensely down the road a few yards, and then ducked back down Camden Passage again, walking fast and breathing hard. Where could he go? To Susan? No -- the police would be there or watching. To the WFT offices in Primrose Hill? No -- same reason. What on earth, he screamed silently at himself, was he doing suddenly as a fugitive?
He insisted to himself, as he had insisted to Dirk, that he should not be running away from the police. The police, he told himself, as he had been taught when he was a boy, were there to help and protect the innocent. This thought caused him instantly to break into a run and he nearly collided with the proud new owner of an ugly Edwardian floor lamp.
âSorry,â he said, âsorry.â He was startled that anyone should want such a thing, and slowed his pace to a walk, glancing with sharp hunted looks around him. The very familiar shop fronts full of old polished brass, old polished wood and pictures of Japanese fish suddenly seemed very threatening and aggressive.
Who could possibly have wanted to kill Gordon? This was the thought that suddenly hammered at him as he turned down Charlton Place. All that had concerned him so far was that he hadnât.
But who had?
This was a new thought.
Plenty of people didnât care for him much, but there is a huge difference between disliking somebody -- maybe even disliking them a lot -- and actually shooting them, strangling them, dragging them through the fields and setting their house on fire. It was a difference which kept the vast majority of the population alive from day to day.

Was it just theft? Dirk hadnât mentioned anything being missing but then he hadnât asked him.
Dirk. The image of his absurd but oddly commanding figure sitting like a large toad, brooding in his shabby office, kept insisting itself upon Richardâs mind. He realised that he was retracing the way he had come, and deliberately made himself turn right instead of left.
That way madness lay.
He just needed a space, a bit of time to think and collect his thoughts together.
All right -- so where was he going? He stopped for a moment, turned around and then stopped again. The idea of dolmades suddenly seemed very attractive and it occurred to him that the cool, calm and collected course of action would have been simply to walk in and have some. That would have shown Fate who was boss.
Instead, Fate was engaged on exactly the same course of action. It wasnât actually sitting in a Greek restaurant eating dolmades, but it might as well have been, because it was clearly in charge. Richardâs footsteps drew him inexorably back through the winding streets, over the canal.
He stopped, briefly, at a corner shop, and then hurried on past the council estates, and into developer territory again until he was standing once more outside 33, Peckender Street. At about the same time as Fate would have been pouring itself the last of the retsina, wiping its mouth and wondering if it had any room left for baklavas, Richard gazed up at the tall ruddy Victorian building with its soot-darkened brickwork and its heavy, forbidding windows. A gust of wind whipped along the street and a small boy bounded up to him.
âFuck off,â chirped the little boy, then paused and looked at him again. ââEre, mister,â he added, âcan I have your jacket?â
âNo,â said Richard.

âWhy not?â said the boy.
âEr, because I like it,â said Richard.
âCanât see why,â muttered the boy. âFuck off.â He slouched off moodily down the street, kicking a stone at a cat.
Richard entered the building once more, mounted the stairs uneasily and looked again into the office.
Dirkâs secretary was sitting at her desk, head down, arms folded. âIâm not here,â she said.
âI see,â said Richard.
âI only came back,â she said, without looking up from the spot on her desk at which she was staring angrily, âto make sure he notices that Iâve gone. Otherwise he might just forget.â
âIs he in?â asked Richard.
âWho knows? Who cares? Better ask someone who works for him, because I donât.â
âShow him in!â boomed Dirkâs voice.
She glowered for a moment, stood up, went to the inner door, wrenched it open, said âShow him in yourself,â slammed the door once more and returned to her seat.
âEr, why donât I just show myself in?â said Richard.
âIcanât evenhear you,âsaid Dirkâs ex-secretary, staring resolutely at her desk. âHow do you expect me to hear you if Iâm not even here?â

Richard made a placatory gesture, which was ignored, and walked through and opened the door to Dirkâs office himself. He was startled to find the room in semi-darkness. A blind was drawn down over the window, and Dirk was lounging back in his seat, his face bizarrely lit by the strange arrangement of objects sitting on the desk. At the forward edge of the desk sat an old grey bicycle lamp, facing backwards and shining a feeble light on a metronome which was ticking softly back and forth, with a highly polished silver teaspoon strapped to its metal rod.
Richard tossed a couple of boxes of matches on to the desk.
âSit down, relax, and keep looking at the spoon,â said Dirk, âyou are already feeling sleepy...â
Another police car pulled itself up to a screeching halt outside Richardâs flat, and a grim-faced man climbed out and strode over to one of the constables on duty outside, flashing an identity card.
âDetective Inspector Mason, Cambridgeshire CID,â he said. âThis the MacDuff place?â
The constable nodded and showed him to the side-door entrance which opened on to the long narrow staircase leading up to the top flat. Mason bustled in and then bustled straight out again.
âThereâs a sofa halfway up the stairs,â he told the constable. âGet it moved.â
âSome of the lads have already tried, sir,â the constable replied anxiously. âIt seems to be stuck. Everyoneâs having to climb over it for the moment, sir. Sorry, sir.â
Mason gave him another grim look from a vast repertoire he had developed which ranged from very, very blackly grim indeed at the bottom of the scale, all the way up to tiredly resigned and only faintly grim, which he reserved for his childrenâs birthdays.
âGet it moved,â he repeated grimly, and bustled grimly back through the door

grimly hauling up his trousers and coat in preparation for the grim ascent ahead.
âNo sign of him yet?â asked the driver of the car, coming over himself. âSergeant Gilks,â he introduced himself. He looked tired.
âNot as far as I know,â said the constable, âbut no one tells me anything.â
âKnow how you feel,â agreed Gilks. âOnce the CID gets involved you just get relegated to driving them about. And Iâm the only one who knows what he looked like. Stopped him in the road last night. We just came from Wayâs house. Right mess.â
âBad night, eh?â
âVaried. Everything from murder to hauling horses out of bathrooms. No, donât even ask. Do you have the same cars as these?â he added, pointing at his
own. âThis oneâs been driving me crazy all the way up. Cold even with the heater on full blast, and the radio keeps turning itself on and off.â
CHAPTER 19
The same morning found Michael Wenton-Weakes in something of an odd mood.
You would need to know him fairly well to know that it was an especially odd mood, because most people regarded him as being a little odd to start with. Few people knew him that well. His mother, perhaps, but there existed between them a state of cold war and neither had spoken to the other now in weeks.
He also had an elder brother, Peter, who was now tremendously senior in the Marines. Apart from at their fatherâs funeral, Michael had not seen Peter since he came back from the Falklands, covered in glory, promotion, and

contempt for his younger brother.
Peter had been delighted that their mother had taken over Magna, and had sent Michael a regimental Christmas card to that effect. His own greatest satisfaction still remained that of throwing himself into a muddy ditch and firing a machine gun for at least a minute, and he didnât think that the British newspaper and publishing industry, even in its current state of unrest, was likely to afford him that pleasure, at least until some more Australians moved into it.
Michael had risen very late after a night of cold savagery and then of troubled dreams which still disturbed him now in the late morning daylight.
His dreams had been filled with the familiar sensations of loss, isolation,
guilt and so forth, but had also been inexplicably involved with large quantities of mud. By the telescopic power of the night, the nightmareof mud andloneliness had seemed to stretch on for terrifying, unimaginable lengths of time, and had only concluded with the appearance of slimy things with legs that had crawled on the slimy sea. This had been altogether too much and he had woken with a start in a cold sweat.
Though all the business with the mud had seemed strange to him, the sense of loss, of isolation, and above all the aggrievement, the need to undo what had been done, these had all found an easy home in his spirit.
Even the slimy things with legs seemed oddly familiar and ticked away irritably at the back of his mind while he made himself a late breakfast, a piece of grapefruit and some China tea, allowed his eyes to rest lightly on the arts pages of the Daily Telegraph for a while, and then rather clumsily changed the dressing on the cuts on his hand.These small tasks accomplished, he was then in two minds as to what to do next.
He was able to view the events of the previous night with a cool detachment that he would not have expected. It had been right, it had been proper, it had been correctly done. But it resolved nothing. All that mattered was yet to be done.

All what? He frowned at the odd way his thoughts ebbed and flowed.
Normally he would pop along to his club at about this time. It used to be that he would do this with a luxurious sense of the fact that there were many other things that he should be doing. Now there was nothing else to do, which made time spent there, as anywhere else, hang somewhat heavy on his hands.
When he went he would do as he always did -- indulge in a gin and tonic and a little light conversation, and then allow his eyes to rest gently on the pages of the Times Literary Supplement, Opera, The New Yorker or whatever else fell easily to hand, but there was no doubt that he did it these days with less verve and relish than previously.
Then there would be lunch. Today, he had no lunch date planned -- again -- and would probably therefore have stayed at his club, and eaten a lightly grilled Dover sole, with potatoes garnished with parsley and boiled to bits, followed by a large heap of trifle. A glass or two of Sancerre. And coffee. And then the afternoon, with whatever that might bring.
But today he felt oddly impelled not to do that. He flexed the muscles in his cut hand, poured himself another cup of tea, looked with curious dispassion at the large kitchen knife that still lay by the fine bone china teapot, and waited for a moment to see what he would do next. What he did next, in fact, was to walk upstairs.
His house was rather chill in its formal perfection, and looked much as people who buy reproduction furniture would like their houses to look. Except of course that everything here was genuine -- crystal, mahogany and Wilton -- and only looked as if it might be fake because there was no life to any of it.
He walked up into his workroom, which was the only room in the house that was not sterile with order, but here the disorder of books and papers was instead sterile with neglect. A thin film of dust had settled over everything. Michael had not been into it in weeks, and the cleaner was under strict instructions to leave it well alone. He had not worked here since he edited the last edition of Fathom. Not, of course, the actual last edition, but the last proper edition. The last edition as far as he was concerned.

He set his china cup down in the fine dust and went to inspect his elderly record player. On it he found an elderly recording of some Vivaldi wind concertos, set it to play and sat down.
He waited again to see what he would do next and suddenly found to his surprise that he was already doing it, and it was this: he was listening to the music.
A bewildered look crept slowly across his face as he realised that he had never done this before. He had heard it many, many times and thought that it made a very pleasant noise. Indeed, he found that it made a pleasant background against which to discuss the concert season, but it had never before occurred to him that there was anything actually to listen to.
He sat thunderstruck by the interplay of melody and counterpoint which suddenly stood revealed to him with a clarity that owed nothing to the dust- ridden surface of the record or the fourteen-year-old stylus.
But withthis revelation came an almostimmediate sense of disappointment, which confused him all the more. The music suddenly revealed to him was oddly unfulfilling. It was as if his capacity to understand the music had suddenly increased up to and far beyond the musicâs ability to satisfy it, all in one dramatic moment.
He strained to listen for what was missing, and felt that the music was like a flightless bird that didnât even know what capacity it had lost. It walked very well, but it walked where it should soar, it walked where it should swoop, it walked where it should climb and bank and dive, it walked where it should thrill with the giddiness of flight. It never even looked up.
He looked up.
After a while he became aware that all he was doing was simply staring stupidly at the ceiling. He shook his head, and discovered that the perception had faded, leaving him feeling slightly sick and dizzy. It had not vanished entirely, but had dropped deep inside him, deeper than he could reach.

The music continued. It was an agreeable enough assortment of pleasant sounds in the background, but it no longer stirred him.
He needed some clues as to what it was he had just experienced, and a thought flicked momentarily at the back of his mind as to where he might find them. He let go of the thought in anger, but it flicked at him again, and kept on flicking at him until at last he acted upon it.From under his desk he pulled out the large tin wastepaper bin. Since he had barred his cleaning lady from even coming in here for the moment, the bin had remained unemptied and he found in it the tattered shreds of what he was looking for with the contents of an ashtray emptied over them.
He overcame his distaste with grim determination and slowly jiggled around the bits of the hated object on his desk, clumsily sticking them together with bits of sticky tape that curled around and stuck the wrong bit to the wrong bit and stuck the right bit to his pudgy fingers and then to the desk, until at last there lay before him, crudely reassembled, a copy of Fathom. As edited by the execrable creature A. K. Ross.
Appalling.
He turned the sticky lumpish pages as if he was picking over chicken giblets. Not a single line drawing of Joan Sutherland or Marilyn Horne anywhere. No profiles of any of the major Cork Street art dealers, not a one.
His series on the Rossettis: discontinued.
âGreen Room Gossipâ: discontinued.
He shook his head in incredulity and then he found the article he was after. âMusic and Fractal Landscapesâ by Richard MacDuff.
He skipped over the first couple of paragraphs of introduction and picked it up further on:

Mathematical analysis and computer modelling are revealing to us that the shapes and processes we encounter in nature -- the way that plants grow, the way that mountains erode or rivers flow, the way that snowflakes or islands achieve their shapes, the way that light plays on a surface, the way the milk folds and spins into your coffee as you stir it, the way that laughter sweeps through a crowd of people -- all these things in their seemingly magical complexity can be described by the interaction of mathematical processes that are, if anything, even more magical in their simplicity.
Shapes that we think of as random are in fact the products
of complex shifting webs of numbers obeying simple rules. The very word ânaturalâthat we have often taken to mean âunstructuredâ in fact describes shapes and processes that appear so unfathomably complex that we cannot consciously perceive the simple natural laws at work.

They can all be described by numbers.
Oddly, this idea seemed less revolting now to Michael than it had done on his first, scant reading.
He read on with increasing concentration.
We know, however, that the mind is capable of understanding these matters in all their complexity and in all their simplicity. A ball flying through the air is responding to the force and direction with which it was thrown, the action of gravity, the friction of the air which it must expend its energy on overcoming, the turbulence of the air around its surface, and the rate and direction of the ballâs spin.
And yet, someone who might have difficulty consciously trying towork outwhat 3 x4x5comesto would haveno trouble in doing differential calculus and a whole host of

related calculations so astoundingly fast that they /can actually catch a flying ball./
People who call this âinstinctâ are merely giving the phenomenon a name, not explaining anything.
I think that the closest that human beings come to expressing our understanding of these natural complexities is in music. It is the most abstract of the arts -- it has no meaning or purpose other than to be itself.
Every single aspect of a piece of music can be represented
by numbers. From the organisation of movements in a whole symphony, down through the patterns of pitch and rhythm that make up the melodies and harmonies, the dynamics that shape the performance, all the way down to the timbres of the notes themselves, their harmonics, the way they change over time, in short, all the elements of a noise that distinguish between

the sound of one person piping on a piccolo and another one thumping a drum -- all of these things can be expressed by patterns and hierarchies of numbers.
And in my experience the more internal relationships there
are between the patterns of numbers at different levels of the hierarchy, however complex and subtle those relationships may be, the more satisfying and, well, whole, the music will seem to be.
In fact the more subtle and complex those relationships, and the further they are beyond the grasp of the conscious mind, the more the instinctive part of your mind -- by which I mean that part of your mind that can do differential calculus so astoundingly fast that it will put your hand in the right place to catch a flying ball -- the more that part of your brain revels in it.
Music of any complexity (and even âThree Blind Miceâ is

complex in its way by the time someone has actually performed it on an instrument with its own individual timbre and articulation) passes beyond your conscious mind into the arms of your own private mathematical genius who dwells in your unconscious responding to all the inner complexities and relationships and proportions that we think we know nothing about.
Some people object to such a view of music, saying that if
you reduce music to mathematics, where does the emotion come into it? I would say that itâs never been out of it.
The things by which our emotions can be moved -- the shape of a flower or a Grecian urn, the way a baby grows, the way the wind brushes across your face, the way clouds move, their shapes, the way light dances on the water, or daffodils flutter in the breeze, the way in which the person you love moves their head, the way their hair follows that movement,

the curve described by the dying fall of the last chord of a piece of music -- all these things can be described by the complex flow of numbers.
Thatâs not a reduction of it, thatâs the beauty of it.
Ask Newton.
Ask Einstein.
Ask the poet (Keats) who said that what the imagination seizes as beauty must be truth.
He might also have said that what the hand seizes as a ball must be truth, but he didnât, because he was a poet and preferred loafing about under trees with a bottle of laudanum and a notebook to playing cricket, but it would have been equally true.

This jogged a thought at the back of Michaelâs memory, but he couldnât immediately place it.
Because that is at the heart of the relationship between on
the one hand our âinstinctiveâ understanding of shape, form, movement, light, and on the other hand our emotional responses to them.
And that is why I believe that there must be a form of music inherent in nature, in natural objects, in the patterns of natural processes. A music that would be as deeply satisfying as any naturally occurring beauty -- and our own deepest emotions are, after all, a form of naturally occurring beauty...
Michael stopped reading and let his gaze gradually drift from the page.
He wondered if he knew what such a music would be and tried to grope in the dark recesses of his mind for it. Each part of his mind that he visited seemed as if that music had been playing there only seconds before and all that was

left was the last dying echo of something he was unable to catch at and hear. He laid the magazine limply aside.
Then he remembered what it was that the mention of Keats had jogged in his memory.
The slimy things with legs from his dream.
A cold calm came over him as he felt himself coming very close to something.
Coleridge. That man.
Yea, slimy things did crawl with legsUpon the slimy sea. âThe Rime of the Ancient Mariner.â
Dazed, Michael walked over to the bookshelf and pulled down his Coleridge anthology. He took it back to his seat and with a certain apprehension he riffled through the pages until he found the opening lines.
It is an ancient Mariner,And he stoppeth one of three.
The words were very familiar to him, and yet as he read on through them they awoke in him strange sensations and fearful memories that he knew were not his. There reared up inside him a sense of loss and desolation of terrifying intensity which, while he knew it was not his own, resonated so perfectly now with his own aggrievements that he could not but surrender to it absolutely.
And a thousand thousand slimy thingsLived on; and so did I.
CHAPTER 20
The blind rolled up with a sharp rattle and Richard blinked.

âA fascinating evening you appear to have spent,â said Dirk Gently, âeven though the most interesting aspects of it seem to have escaped your curiosity entirely.â
He returned to his seat and lounged back in it pressing his fingertips together.
âPlease,â he said, âdo not disappoint me by saying âwhere am I?â A glance will suffice.â
Richard looked around him in slow puzzlement and felt as if he were returning unexpectedly from a long sojourn on another planet where all was peace and light and music that went on for ever and ever. He felt so relaxed he could hardly be bothered to breathe.
The wooden toggle on the end of the blind cord knocked a few times against the window, but otherwise all was now silent. The metronome was still. He glanced at his watch. It was just after one oâclock.
âYou have been under hypnosis for a little less than an hour,â said Dirk, âduring which I have learned many interesting things and been puzzled by some others which I would now like to discuss with you. A little fresh air will probably help revive you and I suggest a bracing stroll along the canal. No one will be looking for you there. Janice!âSilence.
A lot of things were still not clear to Richard, and he frowned to himself. When his immediate memory returned a moment later, it was like an elephant suddenly barging through the door and he sat up with a startled jolt.
âJanice!â shouted Dirk again. âMiss Pearce! Damn the girl.â
He yanked the telephone receivers out of the wastepaper basket and replaced them. An old and battered leather briefcase stood by the desk, and he picked this up, retrieved his hat from the floor and stood up, screwing his hat absurdly on his head.

âCome,â he said, sweeping through the door to where Miss Janice Pearce sat glaring at a pencil, âlet us go. Let us leave this festering hellhole. Let us think the unthinkable, let us do the undoable. Let us prepare to grapple with the ineffable itself, and see if we may not eff it after all. Now, Janice --ââShut up.â
Dirk shrugged, and then picked off her desk the book which earlier she had mutilated when trying to slam her drawer. He leafed through it, frowning, and then replaced it with a sigh. Janice returned to what she had clearly been doing a moment or two earlier, which was writing a long note with the pencil.
Richard regarded all this in silence, still feeling only semi-present. He shook his head.
Dirk said to him, âEvents may seem to you to be a tangled mass of confusion at the moment. And yet we have some interesting threads to pull on. For of all the things you have told me that have happened, only two are actually physically impossible.â
Richard spoke at last. âImpossible?â he said with a frown. âYes,â said Dirk, âcompletely and utterly impossible.â
He smiled.
âLuckily,â he went on, âyou have come to exactly the right place withyourinteresting problem, for there is no suchword as âimpossibleâ in my dictionary. In fact,â he added, brandishing the abused book, âeverything between âherringâ and âmarmaladeâ appears to be missing. Thank you, Miss Pearce, you have once again rendered me sterling service, for which I thank you and will, in the event of a successful outcome to this endeavour, even attempt to pay you. In the meantime we have much to think on, and I leave the office in your very capable hands.â
The phone rang and Janice answered it.
âGood afternoon,âshe said,âWainwrightâs Fruit Emporium. Mr Wainwright is not able to take calls at this time since he is not right in the head and thinks he is

a cucumber. Thank you for calling.â
She slammed the phone down. She looked up again to see the door closing softly behind her ex-employer and his befuddled client.
âImpossible?â said Richard again, in surprise.
âEverything about it,â insisted Dirk, âcompletely and utterly -- well, let us say inexplicable. There is no point in using the word âimpossibleâ to describe something that has clearly happened. But it cannot be explained by anything we know.â
The briskness of the air along the Grand Union Canal got in among Richardâs senses and sharpened them up again. He was restored to his normal faculties, and though the fact of Gordonâs death kept jumping at him all over again every few seconds, he was at least now able to think more clearly about it. Oddly enough, though, that seemed for the moment to be the last thing on Dirkâs mind. Dirk was instead picking on the most trivial of the nightâs sequence of bizarre incidents on which to cross-examine him.
A jogger going one way and a cyclist going the other both shouted at each other to get out of the way, and narrowly avoided hurling each other into the murky, slow-moving waters of the canal. They were watched carefully by a very slow-moving old lady who was dragging an even slower-moving old dog.
On the other bank large empty warehouses stood startled, every window shattered and glinting. A burned-out barge lolled brokenly in the water. Within it a couple of detergent bottles floated on the brackish water. Over the nearest bridge heavy-goods lorries thundered, shaking the foundations of the houses, belching petrol fumes into the air and frightening a mother trying to cross the road with her pram.
Dirk and Richard were walking along from the fringes of South Hackney, amile from Dirkâs office, back towards the heart of Islington, where Dirk knew the nearest lifebelts were positioned.

âBut it was only a conjuring trick, for heavenâs sake,â said Richard. âHe does them all the time. Itâs just sleight of hand. Looks impossible but Iâm sure if you asked any conjurer heâd say itâs easy once you know how these things are done. I once saw a man on the street in New York doing --â
âI know how these things are done,â said Dirk, pulling two lighted cigarettes and a large glazed fig out of his nose. He tossed the fig up in to the air, but it somehow failed to land anywhere. âDexterity, misdirection, suggestion. All things you can learn if you have a little time to waste. Excuse me, dear lady,â he said to the elderly, slow-moving dog-owner as they passed her. He bent down to the dog and pulled a long string of brightly coloured flags from its bottom. âI think he will move more comfortably now,â he said, tipped his hat courteously to her and moved on.
âThese things, you see,â he said to a flummoxed Richard, âare easy. Sawing a lady in half is easy. Sawing a lady in half and then joining her up together again is less easy, but can be done with practice. The trick you described to me with the two-hundred-year-old vase and the college salt cellar is --â he paused for emphasis -- âcompletely and utterly inexplicable.â
âWell there was probably some detail of it I missed, but...ââOh, without question. But the benefit of questioning somebody under hypnosis is that it allows the questioner to see the scene in much greater detail than the subject was even aware of at the time. The girl Sarah, for instance. Do you recall what she was wearing?â
âEr, no,â said Richard, vaguely, âa dress of some kind, I suppose -- â âColour? Fabric?â
âWell, I canât remember, it was dark. She was sitting several places away from me. I hardly glimpsed her.â
âShe was wearing a dark blue cotton velvet dress gathered to a dropped waist. It had raglan sleeves gathered to the cuffs, a white Peter Pan collar and six small pearl buttons down the front -- the third one down had a small thread hanging off it. She had long dark hair pulled back with a red butterfly

hairgrip.â
âIf youâre going to tell me you know all that from looking at a scuff mark on my shoes, like Sherlock Holmes, then Iâm afraid I donât believe you.â
âNo, no,â said Dirk, âitâs much simpler than that. You told me yourself under hypnosis.â
Richard shook his head.
âNot true,â he said, âI donât even know what a Peter Pan collar is.ââBut I do and you described it to me perfectly accurately. As you did the conjuring trick. And that trick was not possible in the form in which it occurred. Believe me. I know whereof I speak. There are some other things I would like to discover about the Professor, like for instance who wrote the note you discovered on the table and how many questions George III actually asked, but --â
âWhat?â
â-- but I think I would do better to question the fellow directly. Except...â He frowned deeply in concentration. âExcept,â he added, âthat being rather vain in these matters I would prefer to know the answers before I asked the questions. And I do not. I absolutely do not.â He gazed abstractedly into the distance, and made a rough calculation of the remaining distance to the nearest lifebelt.
âAnd the second impossible thing,â he added, just as Richard was about to get a word in edgeways, âor at least, the next completely inexplicable thing, is of course the matter of your sofa.â
âDirk,â exclaimed Richard in exasperation, âmay I remind you that Gordon Way is dead, and that I appear to be under suspicion of his murder! None of these things have the remotest connection with that, and I --â
âBut I am extremely inclined to believe that they are connected.â âThatâs absurd!â

âI believe in the fundamental inter--â
âOh, yeah, yeah,â said Richard, âthe fundamental interconnectedness of all things. Listen, Dirk, I am not a gullible old lady and you wonât be getting any trips to Bermuda out of me. If youâre going to help me then letâs stick to the point.â
Dirk bridled at this. âI believe that all things are fundamentally interconnected, as anyonewho follows the principles of quantum mechanics to their logical extremes cannot, if they are honest, help but accept. But I also believe that some things are a great deal more interconnected than others. And when two apparently impossible events and a sequence of highly peculiar ones all occur to the same person, and when that person suddenly becomes the suspect of a highly peculiar murder, then it seems to me that we should look for the solution in the connection between these events. You are the connection, and you yourself have been behaving in a highly peculiar and eccentric way.â
âI have not,â said Richard. âYes, some odd things have happened to me, but I - -â
âYou were last night observed, by me, to climb the outside of a building and break into the flat of your girlfriend, Susan Way.â
âIt may have been unusual,â said Richard, âit may not even have been wise. But it was perfectly logical and rational. I just wanted to undo something I had done before it caused any damage.â
Dirk thought for a moment, and slightly quickened his pace.
âAnd what you did was a perfectly reasonable and normal response to the problem of the message you had left on the tape -- yes, you told me all about that in our little session -- itâs what anyone would have done?â
Richard frowned as if to say that he couldnât see what all the fuss was about. âI donât say anyone would have done it,â he said, âI probably have a slightly more logical and literal turn of mind than many people, which is why I can

write computer software. It was a logical and literal solution to the problem.â
âNot a little disproportionate, perhaps?â
âIt was very important to me not to disappoint Susan yet again.â
âSo you are absolutely satisfied with your own reasons for doing what you did?â
âYes,â insisted Richard angrily.
âDo you know,â said Dirk, âwhat my old maiden aunt who lived in Winnipeg used to tell me?â
âNo,â said Richard. He quickly took off all his clothes and dived into the canal. Dirk leapt for the lifebelt, with which they had just drawn level, yanked it out of its holder and flung it to Richard, who was floundering in the middle of the canal looking completely lost and disoriented.
âGrab hold of this,â shouted Dirk, âand Iâll haul you in.â âItâs all right,â spluttered Richard, âI can swim --â
âNo, you canât,â yelled Dirk, ânow grab it.â
Richard tried to strike out for the bank, but quickly gave up in consternation and grabbed hold of the lifebelt. Dirk pulled on the rope till Richard reached the edge, and then bent down to give him a hand out. Richard came up out of the water puffing and spitting, then turned and sat shivering on the edge with his hands in his lap.
âGod, itâs foul in there!â he exclaimed and spat again. âItâs absolutely disgusting. Yeuchh. Whew. God. Iâm usually a pretty good swimmer. Must have got some kind of cramp. Lucky coincidence we were so close to the lifebelt. Oh thanks.â This last he said in response to the large towel which Dirk handed him.

He rubbed himself down briskly, almost scraping himself with the towel to get the filthy canal water off him. He stood up and looked about. âCan you find my pants?â
âYoung man,â said the old lady with the dog, who had just reached them. She stood looking at them sternly, and was about to rebuke them when Dirk interrupted.
âA thousand apologies, dear lady,â he said, âfor any offence my friend may inadvertently have caused you. Please,â he added, drawing a slim bunch of anemones from Richardâs bottom, âaccept these with my compliments.â
The lady dashed them out of Dirkâs hand with her stick, and hurried off, horror- struck, yanking her dog after her.
âThat wasnât very nice of you,â said Richard, pulling on his clothes underneath the towel that was now draped strategically around him.
âI donât think sheâs a very nice woman,â replied Dirk, âsheâs always down here, yanking her poor dog around and telling people off. Enjoy your swim?â
âNot much, no,â said Richard, giving his hair a quick rub. âI hadnât realised how filthy it would be in there. And cold. Here,â he said, handing the towel back to Dirk, âthanks. Do you always carry a towel around in your briefcase?â
âDo you always go swimming in the afternoons?â
âNo, I usually go in the mornings, to the swimming pool on Highbury Fields, just to wake myself up, get the brain going. It just occurred to me I hadnât been this morning.â
âAnd, er -- that was why you just dived into the canal?â
âWell, yes. I just thought that getting a bit of exercise would probably help me deal with all this.â
âNot a little disproportionate, then, to strip off and jump into the canal.â

âNo,â he said, âit may not have been wise given the state of the water, but it was perfectly --â
âYou were perfectly satisfied with your own reasons for doing what you did.â
âYes --â
âAnd it was nothing to do with my aunt, then?â
Richardâs eyes narrowed suspiciously. âWhat on earth are you talking about?â he said.
âIâll tell you,â said Dirk. He went and sat on a nearby bench and opened his case again. He folded the towel away into it and took out instead a small Sony tape recorder. He beckoned Richard over and then pushed the Play button. Dirkâs own voice floated from the tiny speaker in a lilting singsong voice. It said, âIn a minute I will click my fingers and you will wake and forget all of this except for the instructions I shall now give you.
âIn a little while we will go for a walk along the canal, and when you hear me say the words âmy old maiden aunt who lived in Winnipegâ -- â
Dirk suddenly grabbed Richardâs arm to restrain him.
The tape continued, âYou will take off all your clothes and dive into the canal. You will find that you are unable to swim, but you will not panic or sink, you will simply tread water until I throw you the lifebelt...â
Dirk stopped the tape and looked round at Richardâs face which for the second time that day was pale with shock.
âI would be interested to know exactly what it was that possessed you to climb into Miss Wayâs flat last night,â said Dirk, âand why.â
Richard didnât respond -- he was continuing to stare at the tape recorder in some confusion. Then he said in a shaking voice, âThere was a message from

Gordon on Susanâs tape. He phoned from the car. The tapeâs in my flat. Dirk, Iâm suddenly very frightened by all this.â
CHAPTER 21
Dirk watched the police officer on duty outside Richardâs house from behind a van parked a few yards away. He had been stopping and questioning everyone who tried to enter the small side alley down which Richardâs door was situated, including, Dirk was pleased to note, other policemen if he didnât immediately recognise them. Another police car pulled up and Dirk started to move.
A police officer climbed out of the car carrying a saw and walked towards the doorway. Dirk briskly matched his pace with him, a step or two behind, striding authoritatively.
âItâs all right, heâs with me,â said Dirk, sweeping past at the exact moment that the one police officer stopped the other.
And he was inside and climbing the stairs.
The officer with the saw followed him in.
âEr, excuse me, sir,â he called up after Dirk.
Dirk had just reached the point where the sofa obstructed the stairway. He stopped and twisted round.
âStay here,â he said, âguard this sofa. Do not let anyone touch it, and I mean anyone. Understood?â
The officer seemed flummoxed for a moment. âIâve had orders to saw it up,â he said.

âCountermanded,â barked Dirk. âWatch it like a hawk. I shall want a full report.â
He turned back and climbed up over the thing. A moment or two later he emerged into a large open area. This was the lower of the two floors that comprised Richardâs flat.
âHave you searched that?â snapped Dirk at another officer who was sitting at Richardâs dining table looking through some notes. The officer looked up in surprise and started to stand up. Dirk was pointing at the wastepaper basket.
âEr, yes --â
âSearch it again. Keep searching it. Whoâs here?â
âEr, well --â
âI havenât got all day.â
âDetective Inspector Mason just left, with --â
âGood, Iâm having him pulled off. Iâll be upstairs if Iâm needed, but I donât wantany interruptions unless itâs very important. Understood?â
âEr, who --â
âI donât see you searching the wastepaper basket.â
âEr, right, sir. Iâll --â
âI want it deep-searched. You understand?â
âEr --â
âGet cracking.â Dirk swept on upstairs and into Richardâs workroom.The tape

was lying exactly where Richard had told him it would be, on the long desk on which the six Macintoshes sat. Dirk was about to pocket it when his curiosity was caught by the image of Richardâs sofa slowly twisting and turning on the big Macintosh screen, and he sat down at the keyboard.
He explored the program Richard had written for a short while, but quickly realised that in its present form it was less than self-explanatory and he learned little. He managed at last to get the sofa unstuck and move it back down the stairs, but he realised that he had had to turn part of the wall off in order to do it. With a grunt of irritation he gave up.
Another computer he looked at was displaying a steady sine wave. Around the edges of the screen were the small images of other waveforms which could be selected and added to the main one or used to modify it in other ways. He quickly discovered that this enabled you to build up very complex waveforms from simple ones and he played with this for a while. He added a simple sine wave to itself, which had the effect of doubling the height of the peaks and troughs of the wave. Then he slid one of the waves half a step back with respect to the other, and the peaks and troughs of one simply cancelled out the peaks and troughs of the other, leaving a completely flat line. Then he changed the frequency of one of the sine waves by a small extent.
The result of this was that at some positions along the combined waveform the two waves reinforced each other, and at others they cancelled each other out. Adding a third simple wave of yet another frequency resulted in a combined wave in which it was hard to see any pattern at all. The line danced up and down seemingly at random, staying quite low for some periods and then suddenly building into very large peaks and troughs as all three waves came briefly into phase with each other.
Dirk assumed that there must be amongst this array of equipment a means for translating the waveform dancing on the Macintosh screen into an actual musical tone and hunted among the menus available in the program. He found one menu item which invited him to transfer the wave sample into an Emu.
This puzzled him. He glanced around the room in search of a large flightless

bird, but was unable to locate any such thing. He activated the process anyway, and then traced the cable which led from the back of the Macintosh, down behind the desk, along the floor, behind a cupboard, under a rug until it fetched up plugged into the back of a large grey keyboard called an Emulator II.
This, he assumed, was where his experimental waveform has just arrived. Tentatively he pushed a key.
The nasty farting noise that surged instantly out of the speakers was so loud that for a moment he didnât hear the words âSvlad Cjelli!â that were barked simultaneously from the doorway.
Richard sat in Dirkâs office and threw tiny screwed-up balls of paper at the wastepaper bin which was already full of telephones. He broke pencils. He played major extracts from an old Ginger Baker solo on his knees.
In a word, he fretted.
He had been trying to write down on a piece of Dirkâs notepaper all that he could remember of the events of the previous evening and, as far as he could pinpoint them, the times at which each had occurred. He was astonished at how difficult it was, and how feeble his conscious memory seemed to be in comparison with his unconscious memory, as Dirk had demonstrated it to him.
âDamn Dirk,â he thought. He wanted to talk to Susan.
Dirk had told him he must not do so on any account as there would be a trace on the phone lines.
âDamn Dirk,â he said suddenly, and sprang to his feet.
âHave you got any ten-pence pieces?â he said to the resolutely glum Janice. Dirk turned.
Framed in the doorway stood a tall dark figure.

The tall dark figure appeared to be not at all happy with what it saw, to be rather cross about it, in fact. To be more than cross. It appeared to be a tall dark figure who could very easily yank the heads off half a dozen chickens and still be cross at the end of it.
It stepped forward into the light and revealed itself to be Sergeant Gilks of the Cambridgeshire Constabulary.
âDoyouknow,â said SergeantGilksof theCambridgeshire Constabulary, blinking with suppressed emotion, âthat when I arrive back here to discover one police officer guarding a sofa with a saw and another dismembering an innocent wastepaper basket I have to ask myself certain questions? And I have to ask them with the disquieting sense that I am not going to like the answers when I find them.
âI then find myself mounting the stairs with a horrible premonition, Svlad Cjelli, a very horrible premonition indeed. A premonition, I might add, that I now find horribly justified. I suppose you canât shed any light on a horse discovered in a bathroom as well? That seemed to have an air of you about it.â
âI cannot,â said Dirk, âas yet. Though it interests me strangely.â
âI should think it bloody did. It would have interested you strangely if youâd had to get the bloody thing down a bloody winding staircase at one oâclock in the morning as well. What the hell are you doing here?â said Sergeant Gilks, wearily.
âI am here,â said Dirk, âin pursuit of justice.â
âWell, I wouldnât mix with me then,â said Gilks, âand I certainly wouldnât mix with the Met. What do you know of MacDuff and Way?â
âOf Way? Nothing beyond what is common knowledge. MacDuff I knew at Cambridge.â
âOh, you did, did you? Describe him.â

âTall. Tall and absurdly thin. And good-natured. A bit like a preying mantis that doesnât prey -- a non-preying mantis if you like. A sort of pleasant genial mantis thatâs given up preying and taken up tennis instead.â
âHmm,â said Gilks gruffly, turning away and looking about the room. Dirk pocketed the tape.
âSounds like the same one,â said Gilks.
âAnd of course,â said Dirk, âcompletely incapable of murder.â
âThatâs for us to decide.â
âAnd of course a jury.â
âTchah! Juries!â
âThough, of course, it will not come to that, since the facts will speak for themselves long before it comes to a court of law for my client.â
âYour bleeding client, eh? All right, Cjelli, where is he?â âI havenât the faintest idea.â
âIâll bet youâve got a billing address.â
Dirk shrugged.
âLook, Cjelli, this is a perfectly normal, harmless murder enquiry, and I donât want you mucking it up. So consider yourself warned off as of now. If I see a single piece of evidence being levitated Iâll hit you so hard you wonât know if itâs tomorrow or Thursday. Now get out, and give me that tape on the way.â He held out his hand.
Dirk blinked, genuinely surprised. âWhat tape?â
Gilks sighed. âYouâre a clever man, Cjelli, I grant you that,â he said, âbut you

make the same mistake a lot of clever people do of thinking everyone else is stupid. If I turn away itâs for a reason, and the reason was to see what you picked up. I didnât need to see you pick it up, I just had to see what was missing afterwards. We are trained you know. We used to get half an hour Observation Training on Tuesday afternoons. Just as a break after four
hours solid of Senseless Brutality.â
Dirk hid his anger with himself behind a light smile. He fished in the pocket of his leather overcoat and handed over the tape.
âPlay it,â said Gilks, âletâs see what you didnât want us to hear.ââIt wasnât that I didnât want you to hear it,â said Dirk, with a shrug. âI just wanted to hear it first.â He went over to the shelf which carried Richardâs hi-fi equipment and slipped the tape into the cassette player.
âSo do you want to give me a little introduction?â
âItâs a tape,â said Dirk, âfrom Susan Wayâs telephone answering machine. Way apparently had this habit of leaving long...â
âYeah, I know about that. And his secretary goes round picking up his prattlings in the morning, poor devil.â
âWell, I believe there may be a message on the tape from Gordon Wayâs car last night.â
âI see. OK. Play it.â
With a gracious bow Dirk pressed the Play button.
âOh, Susan, hi, itâs Gordon,â said the tape once again. âJust on my way to the cottage --â
âCottage!â exclaimed Gilks, satirically.
âItâs, er, Thursday night, and itâs, er... 8.47. Bit misty on the roads. Listen, I have those people from the States coming over this weekend...â

Gilks raised his eyebrows, looked at his watch, and made a note on his pad.
Both Dirk and the police sergeant experienced a chill as the dead manâs voice filled the room.
â-- itâs a wonder I donât end up dead in the ditch, that would be something wouldnât it, leaving your famous last words on somebodyâs answering machine, thereâs no reason --â
They listened in a tense silence as the tape played on through the entire message.
âThatâs the problem with crunch-heads -- they have one great idea that actually works and then they expect you to carry on funding them for years while they sit and calculate the topographies of their navels. Iâm sorry, Iâm going to have to stop and close the boot properly. Wonât be a moment.â
Next came the muffled bump of the telephone receiver being dropped on the passenger seat, and a few seconds later the sound of the car door being opened. In the meantime, the music from the carâs sound system could be heard burbling away in the background.
A fewseconds laterstillcamethe distant, muffled, but unmistakable double blam of a shotgun.
âStop the tape,â said Gilks sharply and glanced at his watch. âThree minutes and twenty-five seconds since he said it was 8.47.â He glanced up at Dirk again. âStay here. Donât move. Donât touch anything. Iâve made a note of the position of every particle of air in this room, so I shall know if youâve been breathing.â
He turned smartly and left. Dirk heard him saying as he went down the stairs, âTuckett, get on to WayForwardâs office, get the details of Wayâs carphone, what number, which network...â The voice faded away downstairs.
Quickly Dirk twisted down the volume control on the hi-fi, and resumed playing the tape.

The music continued for a while. Dirk drummed his fingers in frustration. Still the music continued.
He flicked the Fast Forward button for just a moment. Still music. It occurred to him that he was looking for something, but that he didnât know what. That thought stopped him in his tracks.
He was very definitely looking for something. He very definitely didnât know what.
The realisation that he didnât know exactly why he was doing what he was doing suddenly chilled and electrified him. He turned slowly like a fridge door opening.
There was no one there, at least no one that he could see. But he knew the chill prickling through his skin and detested it above all things.
He said in a low savage whisper, âIf anyone can hear me, hear this. My mindis my centre and everything that happens there is my responsibility. Other people may believe what it pleases them to believe, but I will do nothing without I know the reason why and know it clearly. If you want something then let me know, but do not you dare touch my mind.â
He was trembling with a deep and old rage. The chill dropped slowly and almost pathetically from him and seemed to move off into the room. He tried to follow it with his senses, but was instantly distracted by a sudden voice that seemed to come at him on the edge of his hearing, on a distant howl of wind.
It was a hollow, terrified, bewildered voice, no more than an insubstantial whisper, but it was there, audible, on the telephone-answering machine tape.
It said, âSusan! Susan, help me! Help me for Godâs sake. Susan, Iâm dead --â Dirk whirled round and stopped the tape.

âIâm sorry,â he said under his breath, âbut I have the welfare of my client to consider.â
He wound the tape back a very short distance, to just before where the voice began, twisted the Record Level knob to zero and pressed Record. He left the tape to run, wiping off the voice and anything that might follow it. If the tape was going to establish the time of Gordon Wayâs death, then Dirk didnât want any embarrassing examples of Gordon speaking to turn up on the tape after that point, even if it was only to confirm that he was, in fact, dead.
There seemed to be a great eruption of emotion in the air near to him. A wave of something surged through the room, causing the furniture to flutter in its wake. Dirk watched where it seemed to go, towards a shelf near the door on which, he suddenly realised, stood Richardâs own telephone-answering machine. The machine started to jiggle fitfully where it sat, but then sat still as Dirk approached it. Dirk reached out slowly and calmly and pushed the button which set the machine to Answer.
The disturbance in the air then passed back through the room to Richardâs long desk where two old-fashioned rotary-dial telephones nestled among the piles of paper and micro floppy disks. Dirk guessed what would happen, but elected to watch rather than to intervene.
One of the telephone receivers toppled off its cradle. Dirk could hear the dialling tone. Then, slowly and with obvious difficulty, the dial began to turn. It moved unevenly round, further round, slower and slower, and then suddenly slipped back.
There was a momentâs pause. Then the receiver rests went down and up again to get a new dialling tone. The dial began to turn again, but creaking even more fitfully than the last time.
Again it slipped back.
There was a longer pause this time, and then the entire process was repeated once more.

When the dial slipped back a third time there was a sudden explosion of fury -- the whole phone leapt into the air and hurtled across the room. The receiver
cord wrapped itself round an Anglepoise lamp on the way and brought it crashing down in a tangle of cables, coffee cups and floppy disks. A pile of books erupted off the desk and on to the floor.The figure of Sergeant Gilks stood stony-faced in the doorway.
âIâm going to come in again,â he said, âand when I do, I donât want to see anything of that kind going on whatsoever. Is that understood?â He turned and disappeared.
Dirk leapt for the cassette player and hit the Rewind button. Then he turned and hissed at the empty air, âI donât know who you are, but I can guess. If you want my help, donât you ever embarrass me like that again!â
A few moments later, Gilks walked in again. âAh, there you are,â he said.
He surveyed the wreckage with an even gaze. âIâll pretend I canât see any of this, so that I wonât have to ask any questions the answers to which would, I know, only irritate me.â
Dirk glowered.
In the moment or two of silence that followed, a slight ticking whirr could be heard which caused the sergeant to look sharply at the cassette player.
âWhatâs that tape doing?â
âRewinding.â
âGive it to me.â
The tape reached the beginning and stopped as Dirk reached it. He took it out and handed it to Gilks.
âIrritatingly, this seems to put your client completely in the clear,â said the sergeant. âCellnet have confirmed that the last call made from the car was at

8.46 pm last night, at which point your client was lightly dozing in front of several hundred witnesses. I say witnesses, in fact they were mostly students, but we will probably be forced to assume that they canât all be lying.â
âGood,â said Dirk, âwell, Iâm glad thatâs all cleared up.â
âWe never thought he had actually done it, of course. Simply didnât fit. But you know us -- we like to get results. Tell him we still want to ask him some questions, though.â
âI shall be sure to mention it if I happen to run into him.â âYou just do that little thing.â
âWell, I shanât detain you any longer, Sergeant,â said Dirk, airily waving at the door.
âNo, but I shall bloody detain you if youâre not out of here in thirty seconds, Cjelli. I donât know what youâre up to, but if I can possibly avoid finding out I shall sleep easier in my office. Out.â
âThen I shall bid you good day, Sergeant. I wonât say itâs been a pleasure because it hasnât.â
Dirk swept out of the room, and made his way out of the flat, noting with sorrow that where there had been a large chesterfield sofa wedged magnificently in the staircase, there was now just a small, sad pile of sawdust.
With a jerk Michael Wenton-Weakes looked up from his book.
Hismind suddenly was alive with purpose.Thoughts, images, memories, intentions, all crowded in upon him, and the more they seemed to contradict each other the more they seemed to fit together, to pair and settle.
The match at last was perfect, the teeth of one slowly aligned with the teeth of another.

A pull and they were zipped.
Though the waiting had seemed an eternity of eternities when it was filled with failure, with fading waves of weakness, with feeble groping and lonely impotence, the match once made cancelled it all. Would cancel it all. Would undo what had been so disastrously done.
Who thought that? It did not matter, the match was made, the match was perfect.
Michael gazed out of the window across the well-manicured Chelsea street and did not care whether what he saw were slimy things with legs or whether they were all Mr A. K. Ross. What mattered was what they had stolen and what they would be compelled to return. Ross now lay in the past. What he was now concerned with lay still further in it.
His large soft cowlike eyes returned to the last few lines of âKubla Khanâ, which he had just been reading. The match was made, the zip was pulled.
He closed the book and put it in his pocket.
His path back now was clear. He knew what he must do. It only remained to do a little shopping and then do it.
CHAPTER 22
âYou? Wanted for murder? Richard what are you talking about?â
The telephone wavered in Richardâs hand. He was holding it about half an inch away from his ear anyway because it seemed that somebody had dipped the earpiece in some chow mein recently, but that wasnât so bad. This was a public telephone so it was clearly an oversight that it was working at all. But Richard was beginning to feel as if the whole world had shifted about half an inch away from him, like someone in a deodorant commercial.

âGordon,â said Richard, hesitantly, âGordonâs been murdered -- hasnât he?â Susan paused before she answered.
âYes, Richard,â she said in a distressed voice, âbut no one thinks you did it. They want to question you of course, but --â
âSo there are no police with you now?â
âNo, Richard,â insisted Susan, âLook, why donât you come here?â
âAnd theyâre not out searching for me?â
âNo! Where on earth did you get the idea that you were wanted for -- that they thought you had done it?â
âEr -- well, this friend of mine told me.â
âWho?â
âWell, his name is Dirk Gently.â
âYouâve never mentioned him. Who is he? Did he say anything else?â
âHe hypnotised me and, er, made me jump in the canal, and, er, well, that was it really --â
There was a terribly long pause at the other end.
âRichard,â said Susan at last with the sort of calmness that comes over people when they realise that however bad things may seem to be, there is absolutely no reason why they shouldnât simply get worse and worse, âcome over here. I was going to say I need to see you, but I think you need to see me.â
âI should probably go to the police.â

âGo to the police later. Richard, please. A few hours wonât make any difference. I... I can hardly even think. Richard, itâs so awful. It would just help if you were here. Where are you?â
âOK,â said Richard, âIâll be with you in about twenty minutes.â
âShall I leave the window open or would you like to try the door?â she said with a sniff.
CHAPTER 23
âNo, please,â said Dirk, restraining Miss Pearceâs hand from opening a letter from the Inland Revenue, âthere are wilder skies than these.âHe had emerged from a spell of tense brooding in his darkened office and there was an air of excited concentration about him. It had taken his actual signature on an actual salary cheque to persuade Miss Pearce to forgive him for the latest unwarrantable extravagance with which he had returned to the office and he felt that just to sit there blatantly opening letters from the taxman was to take his magnanimous gesture in entirely the wrong spirit.
She put the envelope aside.
âCome!â he said. âI have something I wish you to see. I shall observe your reactions with the very greatest of interest.â
He bustled back into his own office and sat at his desk.
She followed him in patiently and sat opposite, pointedly ignoring the new unwarrantable extravagance sitting on the desk.
The flashy brass plaque for the door had stirred her up pretty badly but the silly phone with big red push buttons she regarded as being beneath contempt. And she certainly wasnât going to do anything rash like smile until she knew for certain that the cheque wouldnât bounce. The last time he signed a cheque

for her he cancelled it before the end of the day, to prevent it, as he explained, âfalling into the wrong handsâ. The wrong hands presumably, being those of her bank manager.
He thrust a piece of paper across the desk.
She picked it up and looked at it. Then she turned it round and looked at it again. She looked at the other side and then she put it down.
âWell?â demanded Dirk. âWhat do you make of it? Tell me!â Miss Pearce sighed.
âItâs a lot of meaningless squiggles done in blue felt tip on a piece of typing paper,â she said. âIt looks like you did them yourself.â
âNo!â barked Dirk, âWell, yes,â he admitted, âbut only because I believe that it is the answer to the problem!â
âWhat problem?â
âThe problem,â insisted Dirk, slapping the table, âof the conjuring trick! I told you!â
âYes, Mr Gently, several times. I think it was just a conjuring trick. You see them on the telly.â
âWith this difference -- that this one was completely impossible!â
âCouldnât have been impossible or he wouldnât have done it. Stands to reason.â
âExactly!â said Dirk excitedly. âExactly! Miss Pearce, you are a lady of rare perception and insight.â
âThank you, sir, can I go now?â

âWait! I havenât finished yet! Not by a long way, not by a bucketful! You have demonstrated to me the depth of your perception and insight, allow me to demonstrate mine!â
Miss Pearce slumped patiently in her seat.
âI think,â said Dirk, âyou will be impressed. Consider this. An intractable problem. In trying to find the solution to it I was going round and round in little circles in my mind, over and over the same maddening things. Clearly I wasnât going to be able to think of anything else until I had the answer, but equally clearly I would have to think of something else if I was ever going to get the answer. How to break this circle? Ask me how.â
âHow?â said Miss Pearce obediently, but without enthusiasm.
âBy writing down what the answer is!â exclaimed Dirk. âAnd here it is!â He slapped the piece of paper triumphantly and sat back with a satisfied smile.
Miss Pearce looked at it dumbly.
âWith the result,â continued Dirk, âthat I am now able to turn my mind to fresh and intriguing problems, like, for instance...â
He took the piece of paper, covered with its aimless squiggles and doodlings, and held it up to her.
âWhat language,â he said in a low, dark voice, âis this written in?âMiss Pearce continued to look at it dumbly.
Dirk flung the piece of paper down, put his feet up on the table, and threw his head back with his hands behind it.
âYou see what I have done?â he asked the ceiling, which seemed to flinch slightly at being yanked so suddenly into the conversation. âI have transformed the problem from an intractably difficult and possibly quite insoluble conundrum into a mere linguistic puzzle. Albeit,â he muttered, after a long moment of silent pondering, âan intractably difficult and possibly insoluble

one.â
He swung back to gaze intently at Janice Pearce.
âGo on,â he urged, âsay that itâs insane -- but it might just work!âJanice Pearce cleared her throat.
âItâs insane,â she said, âtrust me.â
Dirk turned away and sagged sideways off his chair, much as the sitter for The Thinker probably did when Rodin went off to be excused.He suddenly looked profoundly tired and depressed.
âI know,â he said in a low, dispirited voice, âthat there is something profoundly wrong somewhere. And I know that I must go to Cambridge to put it right. But I would feel less fearful if I knew what it was...â
âCan I get on now, please, then?â said Miss Pearce. Dirk looked up at her glumly.
âYes,â he said with a sigh, âbut just -- just tell me --â he flicked at the piece of paper with his fingertips -- âwhat do you think of this, then?â
âWell, I think itâs childish,â said Janice Pearce, frankly.
âBut -- but -- but!â said Dirk thumping the table in frustration. âDonât you understand that we need to be childish in order to understand? Only a child sees things with perfect clarity, because it hasnât developed all those filters which prevent us from seeing things that we donât expect to see?â
âThen why donât you go and ask one?â
âThank you, Miss Pearce,â said Dirk reaching for his hat, âonce again you have rendered me an inestimable service for which I am profoundly grateful.â

He swept out.
CHAPTER 24
The weather began to bleaken as Richard made his way to Susanâs flat. The sky which had started out with such verve and spirit in the morning was beginning to lose its concentration and slip back into its normal English condition, that of a damp and rancid dish cloth. Richard took a taxi, which got him there in a few minutes.
âThey should all be deported,â said the taxi driver as they drew to a halt.
âEr, who should?â said Richard, who realisedhe hadnât been listening to a word the driver said.
âEr --âsaid the driver, who suddenly realised he hadnât been listening either, âer, the whole lot of them. Get rid of the whole bloody lot, thatâs what I say. And their bloody newts,â he added for good measure.
âExpect youâre right,â said Richard, and hurried into the house.
Arriving at the front door of her flat he could hear from within the sounds of Susanâs cello playing a slow, stately melody. He was glad of that, that she was playing. She had an amazingemotional self sufficiency and control provided she could play her cello. He had noticed an odd and extraordinary thing about her relationship with the music she played. If ever she was feeling emotional or upset she could sit and play some music with utter concentration and emerge seeming fresh and calm.The next time she played the same music, however, it would all burst from her and she would go completely to pieces.
He let himself in as quietly as possible so as not to disturb her concentration.
He tiptoed past the small room she practised in, but the door was open so he paused and looked at her, with the slightest of signals that she shouldnât stop.

She was looking pale and drawn but gave him a flicker of a smile and continued bowing with a sudden intensity.
With an impeccable timing of which it is very rarely capable the sun chose that moment to burst briefly through the gathering rainclouds, and as she played her cello a stormy light played on her and on the deep old brown of the wood of the instrument. Richard stood transfixed. The turmoil of the day stood still for a moment and kept a respectful distance.
He didnât know the music, but it sounded like Mozart and he remembered her saying she had some Mozart to learn. He walked quietly on and sat down to wait and listen.
Eventually she finished the piece, and there was about a minute of silence before she came through. She blinked and smiled and gave him a long, trembling hug, then released herself and put the phone back on the hook. It usually got taken off when she was practising.
âSorry,â she said, âI didnât want to stop.â She briskly brushed away a tear as if it was a slight irritation. âHow are you Richard?â
He shrugged and gave her a bewildered look. That seemed about to cover it.
âAnd Iâm going to have to carry on, Iâm afraid,â said Susan with a sigh âIâm sorry. Iâve just been...â She shook her head. âWho would do it?â
âI donât know. Some madman. Iâm not sure that it matters who.â âNo,â she said. âLook, er, have you had any lunch?â
âNo. Susan, you keep playing and Iâll see whatâs in the fridge. We can talk about it all over some lunch.â
Susan nodded.
âAll right,â she said, âexcept...â

âYes?â
âWell, just for the moment I donât really want to talk about Gordon. Just till it sinks in. I feel sort of caught out. It would be easier if Iâd been closer to him, but I wasnât and Iâm sort of embarrassed by not having a reaction ready. Talking about it would be all right except that you have to use the past tense and thatâs whatâs...â
She clung to him for a moment and then quieted herself with a sigh.âThereâs not much in the fridge at the moment,â she said, âsome yoghurt, I think, and a jar of roll-mop herrings you could open. Iâm sure youâll be able to muck it up if you try, but itâs actually quite straightforward. The main trick is not to throw them all over the floor or get jam on them.â
She gave him a hug, a kiss and a glum smile and then retreated back to her music room.
The phone rang and Richard answered it.
âHello?â he said. There was nothing, just a faint sort of windy noise on the line.
âHello?â he said again, waited, shrugged and put the phone back down.
âWas there anybody there?â called Susan.
âNo, no one,â said Richard.
âThatâs happened a couple of times,â said Susan. âI think itâs a sort of minimalist heavy breather.â She resumed playing.
Richard went into the kitchen and opened the fridge. He was less of a health- conscious eater than Susan and was therefore less than thrilled by what he found there, but he managed to put some roll-mop herrings, some yoghurt, some rice and some oranges on a tray without difficulty and tried not to think that a couple of fat hamburgers and fries would round it off nicely.

He found a bottle of white wine and carried it all through to the small dining table.
After a minute or two Susan joined him there. She was at her most calm and composed, and after a few mouthsful she asked him about the canal.
Richard shook his head in bemusement and tried to explain about it, and about Dirk.
âWhat did you say his name was?â said Susan with a frown when he had come, rather lamely, to a conclusion.
âItâs, er, Dirk Gently,â said Richard, âin a way.â âIn a way?â
âEr, yes,â said Richard with a difficult sigh. He reflected that just about anything you could say about Dirk was subject to these kind of vague and shifty qualifications. There was even, on his letter heading, a string of vague and shifty-looking qualifications after his name. He pulled out the piece of paper on which he had vainly been trying to organise his thoughts earlier in the day.
âI...â he started, but the doorbell rang. They looked at each other.âIf itâs the police,â said Richard, âIâd better see them. Letâs get it over with.â
Susan pushed back her chair, went to the front door and picked up the Entryphone.
âHello?â she said.
âWho?â she said after a moment. She frowned as she listened then swung round and frowned at Richard.
âYouâd better come up,â she said in a less than friendly tone of voice and then pressed the button. She came back and sat down.

âYour friend,â she said evenly, âMr Gently.â
The Electric Monkâs day was going tremendously well and he broke into an excited gallop. That is to say that, excitedly, he spurred his horse to a gallop and, unexcitedly, his horse broke into it.
This world, the Monk thought, was a good one. He loved it. He didnât know whose it was or where it had come from, but it was certainly a deeply fulfilling place for someone with his unique and extraordinary gifts.
He was appreciated. All day he had gone up to people, fallen into conversation with them, listened to their troubles, and then quietly uttered those three magic words, âI believe you.â
The effect had invariably been electrifying. It wasnât that people on this world didnât occasionally say it to each other, but they rarely, it seemed,
managed to achieve that deep timbre of sincerity which the Monk had been so superbly programmed to reproduce.
On his own world, after all, he was taken for granted. People would just expect him to get on and believe things for them without bothering them. Someone would come to the door with some great new idea or proposal or even a
new religion, and the answer would be âOh, go and tell that to the Monk.â And the Monk would sit and listen and patiently believe it all, but no one would take any further interest.
Only one problem seemed to arise on this otherwise excellent world. Often, after he had uttered the magic words, the subject would rapidly change to that of money, and the Monk of course didnât have any -- a shortcoming that had quickly blighted a number of otherwise very promising encounters.
Perhaps he should acquire some -- but where?
He reined his horse in for a moment, and the horse jerked gratefully to a halt and started in on the grass on the roadside verge. The horse had no idea what all this galloping up and down was in aid of, and didnât care. All it did care about was that it was being made to gallop up and down past a seemingly

perpetual roadside buffet. It made the best of its moment while it had it.
The Monk peered keenly up and down the road. It seemed vaguely familiar. He trotted a little further up it for another look. The horse resumed its meal a few yards further along.
Yes. The Monk had been here last night.
He remembered it clearly, well, sort of clearly. He believed that he remembered it clearly, and that, after all, was the main thing. Here was where he had walked to in a more than usually confused state of mind, and just around the very next corner, if he was not very much mistaken, again, lay the small roadside establishment at which he had jumped into the back of that nice manâs car -- the nice man who had subsequently reacted so oddly to being shot at.
Perhaps they would have some money there and would let him have it. He wondered. Well, he would find out. He yanked the horse from its feast once again and galloped towards it.
As he approached the petrol station he noticed a car parked there at an arrogant angle. The angle made it quite clear that the car was not there for anything so mundane as to have petrol put into it, and was much too important to park itself neatly out of the way. Any other car that arrived for petrol would just have to manoeuvre around it as best it could. The car was white with stripes and badges and important looking lights.
Arriving at the forecourt the Monk dismounted and tethered his horse to a pump. He walked towards the small shop building and saw that inside it there was a man with his back to him wearing a dark blue uniform and a peaked cap. The man was dancing up and down and twisting his fingers in his ears, and this was clearly making a deep impression on the man behind the till.
The Monk watched in transfixed awe. The man, he believed with an instant effortlessness which would have impressed even a Scientologist, must be a God of some kind to arouse such fervour. He waited with bated breath to worship him. In a moment the man turned around and walked out of the shop, saw the

Monk and stopped dead.
The Monk realised that the God must be waiting for him to make an act of worship, so he reverently danced up and down twisting his fingers in his ears.
His God stared at him for a moment, caught hold of him, twisted him round, slammed him forward spreadeagled over the car and frisked him for weapons.
Dirk burst into the flat like a small podgy tornado.
âMiss Way,â he said, grasping her slightly unwilling hand and doffing his absurd hat, âit is the most inexpressible pleasure to meet you, but also the matter of the deepest regret that the occasion of our meeting should be one of such great sorrow and one which bids me extend to you my most profound sympathy and commiseration. I ask you to believe me that I would not intrude upon your private grief for all the world if it were not on a matter of the gravest moment and magnitude. Richard -- I have solved the problem of the conjuring trick and itâs extraordinary.â
He swept through the room and deposited himself on a spare chair at the small dining table, on which he put his hat.
âYou will have to excuse us, Dirk --â said Richard, coldly.
âNo, I am afraid you will have to excuse me,â returned Dirk. âThe puzzle is solved, and the solution is so astounding that it took a seven-year-old child on the street to give it to me. But it is undoubtedly the correct one, absolutely undoubtedly. âWhat, then, is the solution?â you ask me, or rather would ask me if you could get a word in edgeways, which you canât, so I will save you the bother and ask the question for you, and answer it as well by saying that I will not tell you, because you wonât believe me. I shall instead show you, this very afternoon.
âRest assured, however, that it explains everything. It explains the trick. It explains the note you found -- that should have made it perfectly clear to
me but I was a fool. And it explains what the missing third question was, or

rather -- and this is the significant point -- it explains what the missing first question was!â
âWhat missing question?â exclaimed Richard, confused by the sudden pause, and leaping in with the first phrase he could grab.
Dirk blinked as if at an idiot. âThe missing question that George III asked, of course,â he said.
âAsked who?â
âWell, the Professor,â said Dirk impatiently. âDonât you listen to anything you say? The whole thing was obvious!â he exclaimed, thumping the table, âSo obvious that the only thing which prevented me from seeing the solution was the trifling fact that it was completely impossible. Sherlock Holmes observed that once you have eliminated the impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the answer. I, however, do not like to eliminate the impossible. Now. Let us go.â
âNo.â
âWhat?â Dirk glanced up at Susan, from whom this unexpected -- or at least, unexpected to him -- opposition had come.
âMr Gently,â said Susan in a voice you could notch a stick with, âwhy did you deliberately mislead Richard into thinking that he was wanted by the police?â
Dirk frowned.
âBut he was wanted by the police,â he said, âand still is.â
âYes, but just to answer questions! Not because heâs a suspected murderer.â Dirk looked down.
âMiss Way,â he said, âthe police are interested in knowing who murdered

your brother. I, with the very greatest respect, am not. It may, I concede, turn out to have a bearing on the case, but it may just as likely turn out to be a casual madman. I wanted to know, still need desperately to know, why Richard climbed into this flat last night.ââI told you,â protested Richard.
âWhat you told me is immaterial -- it only reveals the crucial fact that you do not know the reason yourself! For heavenâs sake I thought I had demonstrated that to you clearly enough at the canal!â
Richard simmered.
âIt was perfectly clear to me watching you,â pursued Dirk, âthat you had very little idea what you were doing, and had absolutely no concern about the physical danger you were in. At first I thought, watching, that it was just a brainless thug out on his first and quite possibly last burgle. But then the figure looked back and I realised it was you -- and I know you to be an intelligent, rational, and moderate man. Richard MacDuff? Risking his neck carelessly climbing up drainpipes at night? It seemed to me that you would only behave in such a reckless and extreme way if you were desperately worried about something of terrible importance. Is that not true, Miss Way?â
He looked sharply up at Susan, who slowly sat down, looking at him with an alarm in her eyes which said that he had struck home.
âAnd yet, when you came to see me this morning you seemed perfectly calm and collected. You argued with me perfectly rationally when I talked a lot of nonsense about SchrÃ¶dingerâs Cat. This was not the behaviour of someone who had the previous night been driven to extremes by some desperate purpose. I confess that it was at that moment that I stooped to, well, exaggerating your predicament, simply in order to keep hold of you.â
âYou didnât. I left.â
âWith certain ideas in your head. I knew you would be back. I apologise most humbly for having misled you, er, somewhat, but I knew that what I had to find out lay far beyond what the police would concern themselves with. And it was this -- if you were not quite yourself when you climbed the wall

last night... then who were you, -- and why?â
Richard shivered. A silence lengthened.
âWhat has it got to do with conjuring tricks?â he said at last.
âThat is what we must go to Cambridge to find out.â
âBut what makes you so sure -- ?â
âIt disturbs me,â said Dirk, and a dark and heavy look came into his face. For one so garrulous he seemed suddenly oddly reluctant to speak.
He continued, âIt disturbs me very greatly when I find that I know things and do not know why I know them. Maybe it is the same instinctive processing of data that allows you to catch a ball almost before youâve seen it. Maybe
it is the deeper and less explicable instinct that tells you when someone is watching you. It is a very great offence to my intellect that the very things that I despise other people for being credulous of actually occur to me. You will remember the... unhappiness surrounding certain exam questions.â
He seemed suddenly distressed and haggard. He had to dig deep inside himself to continue speaking.
He said, âThe ability to put two and two together and come up instantly with four is one thing. The ability to put the square root of five hundred and thirty-nine point seven together with the cosine of twenty-six point four three two and come up with... with whatever the answer to that is, is quite another. And I... well, let me give you an example.â
He leant forward intently. âLast night I saw you climbing into this flat. I knew that something was wrong. Today I got you to tell me every last detail you knew about what happened last night, and already, as a result, using my intellect alone, I have uncovered possibly the greatest secret lying hidden on this planet. I swear to you that this is true and that I can prove it. Now you must believe me when I tell you that I know, I know that there is something

terribly, desperately, appallingly wrong and that we must find it. Will you go with me now, to Cambridge?â
Richard nodded dumbly.
âGood,â said Dirk. âWhat is this?â he added, pointing at Richardâs plate. âA pickled herring. Do you want one?â
âThank you, no,â said Dirk, rising and buckling his coat. âThere is,â he added as he headed towards the door, steering Richard with him, âno such word as âherringâ in my dictionary. Good afternoon, Miss Way, wish us God speed.â
CHAPTER 25
There was a rumble of thunder, and the onset of that interminable tight drizzle from the north-east by which so many of the worldâs most momentous events seem to be accompanied.
Dirk turned up the collar of his leather overcoat against the weather, but nothing could dampen his demonic exuberance as he and Richard approached the great twelfth-century gates.
âSt Ceddâs College, Cambridge,â he exclaimed, looking at them for the first time in eight years. âFounded in the year something or other, by someone I forget in honour of someone whose name for the moment escapes me.â
âSt Cedd?â suggested Richard.
âDo you know, I think it very probably was? One of the duller Northumbrian saints. His brother Chad was even duller. Has a cathedral in Birmingham if that gives you some idea. Ah, Bill, how good to see you again,â he added, accosting the porter who was just walking into the college as well. The porter looked round.

âMr Cjelli, nice to see you back, sir. Sorry you had a spot of bother, hope thatâs all behind you now.â
âIndeed, Bill, it is. You find me thriving. And Mrs Roberts? How is she? Foot still troubling her?â
âNot since she had it off, thanks for asking, sir. Between you and me, sir, I wouldâve been just as happy to have had her amputated and kept the foot. I had a little spot reserved on the mantelpiece, but there we are, we have to take things as we find them.
âMr MacDuff, sir,â he added, nodding curtly at Richard. âOh that horse you mentioned, sir, when you were here last night, Iâm afraid we had to have it removed. It was bothering Professor Chronotis.â
âI was only curious, er, Bill,â said Richard. âI hope it didnât disturb you.â
âNothing ever disturbs me, sir, so long as it isnât wearing a dress. Canât abide it when the young fellers wear dresses, sir.â
âIf the horse bothers you again, Bill,â interrupted Dirk, patting him on the shoulder, âsend it up to me and I shall speak with it. Now, you mention the good Professor Chronotis. Is he in at the moment? Weâve come on an errand.â
âFar as I know, sir. Canât check for you because his phoneâs out of order. Suggest you go and look yourself. Far left corner of Second Court.â
âI know it well, Bill, thank you, and my best to what remains of Mrs Roberts.â
They swept on through into First Court, or at least Dirk swept, and Richard walked in his normal heron-like gait, wrinkling up his face against the measly drizzle.
Dirk had obviously mistaken himself for a tour guide.
âSt Ceddâs,â he pronounced, âthe college of Coleridge, and the college of

Sir Isaac Newton, renowned inventor of the milled-edge coin and the catflap!â âThe what?â said Richard.
âThe catflap! A device of the utmost cunning, perspicuity and invention. It is a door within a door, you see, a...â
âYes,â said Richard, âthere was also the small matter of gravity.â
âGravity,â said Dirk with a slightly dismissive shrug, âyes, there was that as well, I suppose. Though that, of course, was merely a discovery. It was there to be discovered.â
He took a penny out of his pocket and tossed it casually on to the pebbles that ran alongside the paved pathway.
âYou see?â he said, âThey even keep it on at weekends. Someone was bound to notice sooner or later. But the catflap... ah, there is a very different matter. Invention, pure creative invention.â
âI would have thought it was quite obvious. Anyone could have thought of it.â
âAh,â said Dirk, âit is a rare mind indeed that can render the hitherto non- existent blindingly obvious. The cry âI could have thought of thatâ is a very popular and misleading one, for the fact is that they didnât, and a very significant and revealing fact it is too. This if I am not mistaken is the staircase we seek. Shall we ascend?â
Without waiting for an answer he plunged on up the stairs. Richard, following uncertainly, found him already knocking on the inner door. The outer one stood open.
âCome in!â called a voice from within. Dirk pushed the door open, and they were just in time to see the back of Regâs white head as he disappeared into the kitchen.

âJust making some tea,â he called out. âLike some? Sit down, sit down, whoever you are.â
âThat would be most kind,â returned Dirk. âWe are two.â Dirk sat, and Richard followed his lead.
âIndian or China?â called Reg. âIndian, please.â
There was a rattle of cups and saucers.
Richard looked around the room. It seemed suddenly humdrum. The fire was burning quietly away to itself, but the light was that of the grey afternoon. Though everything about it was the same, the old sofa, the table burdened with books, there seemed nothing to connect it with the hectic strangeness of the previous night. The room seemed to sit there with raised eyebrows, innocently saying âYes?â
âMilk?â called out Reg from the kitchen.
âPlease,â replied Dirk. He gave Richard a smile which seemed to him to be half-mad with suppressed excitement.
âOne lump or two?â called Reg again.
âOne, please,â said Dirk, â...and two spoons of sugar if you would.âThere was a suspension of activity in the kitchen. A moment or two passed and Reg stuck his head round the door.
âSvlad Cjelli!â he exclaimed. âGood heavens! Well, that was quick work, young MacDuff, well done. My dear fellow, how very excellent to see you, how good of you to come.â
He wiped his hands on a tea towel he was carrying and hurried over to shake hands.

âMy dear Svlad.â
âDirk, please, if you would,â said Dirk, grasping his hand warmly, âI prefer it. It has more of a sort of Scottish dagger feel to it, I think. Dirk Gently is the name under which I now trade. There are certain events in the past, Iâm afraid, from which I would wish to disassociate myself.â
âAbsolutely, I know how you feel. Most of the fourteenth century, for instance, was pretty grim,â agreed Reg earnestly.
Dirk was about to correct the misapprehension, but thought that it might be somewhat of a long trek and left it.
âSo how have you been, then, my dear Professor?â he said instead, decorously placing his hat and scarf upon the arm of the sofa.
âWell,â said Reg, âitâs been an interesting time recently, or rather, a dull time. But dull for interesting reasons. Now, sit down again, warm yourselves by the fire, and I will get the tea and endeavour to explain.â He bustled out again, humming busily, and left them to settle themselves in front of the fire.
Richard leant over to Dirk. âI had no idea you knew him so well,â he said with a nod in the direction of the kitchen.
âI donât,â said Dirk instantly. âWe met once by chance at some dinner, but there was an immediate sympathy and rapport.â
âSo how come you never met again?â
âHe studiously avoided me, of course. Close rapports with people are dangerous if you have a secret to hide. And as secrets go, I fancy that this is somewhat of a biggie. If there is a bigger secret anywhere in the world I would very much care,â he said quietly, âto know what it is.â
He gave Richard a significant look and held his hands out to the fire. Since Richard had tried before without success to draw him out on exactly what the secret was, he refused to rise to the bait on this occasion, but sat back in his

armchair and looked about him.
âDid I ask you,â said Reg, returning at that moment, âif you wanted any tea?â
âEr, yes,â said Richard, âwe spoke about it at length. I think we agreed in the end that we would, didnât we?â
âGood,â said Reg, vaguely, âby a happy chance there seems to be some ready in the kitchen. Youâll have to forgive me. I have a memory like a... like a... what are those things you drain rice in? What am I talking about?â
With a puzzled look he turned smartly round and disappeared once more into the kitchen.
âVery interesting,â said Dirk quietly, âI wondered if his memory might be poor.â
He stood, suddenly, and prowled around the room. His eyes fell on the abacus which stood on the only clear space on the large mahogany table.
âIs this the table,â he asked Richard in a low voice, âwhere you found the note about the salt cellar?â
âYes,â said Richard, standing, and coming over, âtucked into this book.â He picked up the guide to the Greek islands and flipped through it.
âYes, yes, of course,â said Dirk, impatiently. âWe know about all that. Iâm just interested that this was the table.â He ran his fingers along its edge, curiously.
âIf you think it was some sort of prior collaboration between Reg and the girl,â Richard said, âthen I must say that I donât think it possibly can have been.â
âOf course it wasnât,â said Dirk testily, âI would have thought that was perfectly clear.â

Richard shrugged in an effort not to get angry and put the book back down again.
âWell, itâs an odd coincidence that the book should have been...â
âOdd coincidence!â snorted Dirk. âHa! We shall see how much of a coincidence. We shall see exactly how odd it was. I would like you, Richard, to ask our friend how he performed the trick.â
âI thought you said you knew already.â
âI do,â said Dirk airily. âI would like to hear it confirmed.â
âOh, I see,â said Richard, âyes, thatâs rather easy, isnât it? Get him to explain it, and then say, âYes, thatâs exactly what I thought it was!â Very good, Dirk. Have we come all the way up here in order to have him explain how he did a conjuring trick? I think I must be mad.âDirk bridled at this.
âPlease do as I ask,â he snapped angrily. âYou saw him do the trick, you must ask how he did it. Believe me, there is an astounding secret hidden within it. I know it, but I want you to hear it from him.â
He spun round as Reg re-entered, bearing a tray, which he carried round the sofa and put on to the low coffee table that sat in front of the fire.
âProfessor Chronotis...â said Dirk. âReg,â said Reg, âplease.â
âVery, well,â said Dirk, âReg...â âSieve!â exclaimed Reg.
âWhat?â
âThing you drain rice in. A sieve. I was trying to remember the word, though I forget now the reason why. No matter. Dirk, dear fellow, you look as if you

are about to explode about something. Why donât you sit down and make yourself comfortable?â
âThank you, no, I would rather feel free to pace up and down fretfully if I may. Reg...â
He turned to face him square on, and raised a single finger. âI must tell you,â he said, âthat I know your secret.â
âAh, yes, er -- do you indeed?â mumbled Reg, looking down awkwardly and fiddling with the cups and teapot. âI see.â
The cups rattled violently as he moved them. âYes, I was afraid of that.â
âAnd there are some questions that we would like to ask you. I must tell you that I await the answers with the very greatest apprehension.ââIndeed, indeed,â Reg muttered. âWell, perhaps it is at last time. I hardly know myself what to make of recent events and am... fearful myself. Very well. Ask what you will.â He looked up sharply, his eyes glittering.
Dirk nodded curtly at Richard, turned, and started to pace, glaring at the floor.
âEr,â said Richard, âwell. Iâd be... interested to know how you did the conjuring trick with the salt cellar last night.â
Reg seemed surprised and rather confused by the question. âThe conjuring trick?â he said.
âEr, yes,â said Richard, âthe conjuring trick.â
âOh,â said Reg, taken aback, âwell, the conjuring part of it, Iâm not sure I should -- Magic Circle rules, you know, very strict about revealing these secrets. Very strict. Impressive trick, though, donât you think?â he added slyly.
âWell, yes,â said Richard, âit seemed very natural at the time, but now that I... think about it, I have to admit that it was a bit dumbfounding.â

âAh, well,â said Reg, âitâs skill. you see. Practice. Make it look natural.â
âIt did look very natural,â continued Richard, feeling his way, âI was quite taken in.â
âYou liked it?â
âIt was very impressive.â
Dirk was getting a little impatient. He shot a look to that effect at Richard.
âAnd I can quite see,â said Richard firmly, âwhy itâs impossible for you to tell me. I was just interested, thatâs all. Sorry I asked.â
âWell,â said Reg in a sudden seizure of doubt, âI suppose... well, so long as you absolutely promise not to tell anyone else.â he carried on, âI suppose you can probably work out for yourself that I used two of the salt cellars on the table. No one was going to notice the difference between one and another. The quickness of the hand, you know, deceives the eye, particularly some of the eyes around that table. While I was fiddling with my woolly hat, giving, though I say so myself, a very cunning simulation of clumsiness and muddle, I
simply slipped the salt cellar down my sleeve. You see?â
His earlier agitation had been swept away completely by his pleasure in showing off his craft.
âItâs the oldest trick in the world, in fact,â he continued, âbut nevertheless takes a great deal of skill and deftness. Then a little later, of course, I returned it to the table with the appearance of simply passing it to someone else. Takes years of practice, of course, to make it look natural, but I much prefer it to simply slipping the thing down to the floor. Amateur stuff that. You canât pick it up, and the cleaners never notice it for at least a fortnight. I once had a dead thrush under my seat for a month. No trick involved there, of course. Cat killed it.â
Reg beamed.

Richard felt he had done his bit, but hadnât the faintest idea where it was supposed to have got them. He glanced at Dirk, who gave him no help whatsoever, so he plunged on blindly.
âYes,â he said, âyes, I understand that that can be done by sleight of hand. What I donât understand is how the salt cellar got embedded in the pot.â
Reg looked puzzled once again, as if they were all talking at cross purposes. He looked at Dirk, who stopped pacing and stared at him with bright, expectant eyes.
âWell, thatâs... perfectly straightforward,â said Reg, âdidnât take any conjuring skill at all. I nipped out for my hat, you remember?â
âYes,â said Richard, doubtfully.
âWell,â said Reg, âwhile I was out of the room I went to find the man who made the pot. Took some time, of course. About three weeks of detective
work to track him down and another couple of days to sober him up, and then with a little difficulty I persuaded him to bake the salt cellar into the pot for me. After that I briefly stopped off somewhere to find some, er, powder to disguise the suntan, and of course I had to time the return a little carefully so as to make it all look natural. I bumped into myself in the anteroom, which I always find embarrassing, I never know where to look, but, er... well, there you have it.â
He smiled a rather bleak and nervous smile. Richard tried to nod, but eventually gave up. âWhat on earth are you talking about?â he said. Reg looked at him in surprise.
âI thought you said you knew my secret,â he said.

âI do,â said Dirk, with a beam of triumph. âHe, as yet, does not, though he furnished all the information I needed to discover it. Let me,â he added, âfill in a couple of little blanks. In order to help disguise the fact that you had in fact been away for weeks when as far as anyone sitting at the table was concerned you had only popped out of the door for a couple of seconds, you had to write down for your own reference the last thing you said, in order that you could pick up the thread of conversation again as naturally as possible. An important detail if your memory is not what it once was. Yes?â
âWhat it once was,â said Reg, slowly shaking his white head, âI can hardly remember what it once was. But yes, you are very sharp to pick up such a detail.â
âAnd then there is the little matter,â continued Dirk, âof the questions that George III asked. Asked you.â
This seemed to catch Reg quite by surprise.
âHe asked you,â continued Dirk, consulting a small notebook he had pulled from his pocket, âif there was any particular reason why one thing happened after another and if there was any way of stopping it. Did he not also ask you, and ask you first, if it was possible to move backwards in time, or something of that kind?âReg gave Dirk a long and appraising look.
âI was right about you,â he said, âyou have a very remarkable mind, young man.â He walked slowly over to the window that looked out on to Second Court. He watched the odd figures scuttling through it hugging themselves in the drizzle or pointing at things.
âYes,â said Reg at last in a subdued voice, âthat is precisely what he said.â
âGood,â said Dirk, snapping shut his notebook with a tight little smile which said that he lived for such praise, âthen that explains why the answers were yes, no and maybe -- in that order. Now. Where is it?ââWhere is what?â
âThe time machine.â

âYouâre standing in it.â said Reg.
CHAPTER 26
A party of noisy people spilled into the trainat Bishopâs Stortford. Some were wearing morning suits with carnations looking a little battered by a dayâs festivity. The women of the party were in smart dresses and hats, chattering excitedly about how pretty Julia had looked in all that silk taffeta, how Ralph still looked like a smug oaf even done up in all his finery, and generally giving the whole thing about two weeks.
One of the men stuck his head out of the window and hailed a passing railway employee just to check that this was the right train and was stopping at Cambridge. The porter confirmed that of course it bloody was. The young man said that they didnât all want to find they were going off in the wrong direction, did they, and made a sound a little like that of a fish barking, as if to indicate that this was a pricelessly funny remark, and then pulled his head back in, banging it on the way.
The alcohol content of the atmosphere in the carriage rose sharply.There seemed to be a general feeling in the air that the best way of getting themselves in the right mood for the post-wedding reception party that evening was to make a foray to the bar so that any members of the party who were not already completely drunk could finish the task. Rowdy shouts of
acclamation greeted this notion, the train restarted with a jolt and a lot of those still standing fell over.
Three young men dropped into the three empty seats round one table, of which the fourth was already taken by a sleekly overweight man in an old-fashioned suit. He had a lugubrious face and his large, wet, cowlike eyes gazed into some unknown distance.
Very slowly his eyes began to refocus all the way from infinity and gradually to home in on his more immediate surroundings, his new and intrusive

companions. There was a need he felt, as he had felt before.The three men were discussing loudly whether they would all go to the bar, whether some of them would go to the bar and bring back drinks for the others, whether the ones who went to the bar would get so excited by all the drinks there that they would stay put and forget to bring any back for the others who would be sitting here anxiously awaiting their return, and whether even if they did remember to come back immediately with the drinks they would actually be capable of carrying them and wouldnât simply throw them all over the carriage on the way back, incommoding other passengers.
Some sort of consensus seemed to be reached, but almost immediately none of them could remember what it was. Two of them got up, then sat down again as the third one got up. Then he sat down. The two other ones stood up again, expressing the idea that it might be simpler if they just bought the entire bar.
The third was about to get up again and follow them, when slowly, but with unstoppable purpose, the cow-eyed man sitting opposite him leant across, and gripped him firmly by the forearm.
The young man in his morning suit looked up as sharply as his somewhat bubbly brain would allow and, startled, said, âWhat do you want?â
Michael Wenton-Weakes gazed into his eyes with terrible intensity, and said, in a low voice, âI was on a ship...â
âWhat?â
âA ship...â said Michael.
âWhat ship, what are you talking about? Get off me. Let go!â
âWe came,â continued Michael, in a quiet, almost inaudible, but compelling voice, âa monstrous distance. We came to build a paradise. A paradise. Here.â
His eyes swam briefly round the carriage, and then gazed briefly out through the spattered windows at the gathering gloom of a drizzly East Anglian evening. He gazed with evident loathing. His grip on the otherâs forearm

tightened.
âLook, Iâm going for a drink,â said the wedding guest, though feebly, because he clearly wasnât.
âWe left behind those who would destroy themselves with war,â murmured Michael. âOurs was to be a world of peace, of music, of art, of enlightenment. All that was petty, all that was mundane, all that was contemptible would have no place in our world...â
The stilled reveller looked at Michael wonderingly. He didnât look like an old hippy. Of course, you never could tell. His own elder brother had once spent a couple of years living in a Druidic commune, eating LSD doughnuts
and thinking he was a tree, since when he had gone on to become a director of a merchant bank. The difference, of course, was that he hardly ever still
thought he was a tree, except just occasionally, and he had long ago learnt to avoid the particular claret which sometimes triggered off that flashback.
âThere were those who said we would fail,â continued Michael in his low tone that carried clearly under the boisterous noise that filled the carriage, âwho prophesied that we too carried in us the seed of war, but it was our high resolve and purpose that only art and beauty should flourish, the highest art, the highest beauty -- music. We took with us only those who believed, who wished it to be true.â
âBut what are you talking about?â asked the wedding guest though not challengingly, for he had fallen under Michaelâs mesmeric spell. âWhen was this? Where was this?â
Michael breathed hard. âBefore you were born --âhe said at last, âbe still, and I will tell you.â
CHAPTER 27

There was a long startled silence during which the evening gloom outside seemed to darken appreciably and gather the room into its grip. A trick of the light wreathed Reg in shadows.
Dirk was, for one of the few times in a life of exuberantly prolific loquacity, wordless. His eyes shone with a childâs wonder as they passed anew over the dull and shabby furniture of the room, the panelled walls, the threadbare carpets. His hands were trembling.
Richard frowned faintly to himself for a moment as if he was trying to work out the square root of something in his head, and then looked back directly at Reg.
âWho are you?â he asked.
âI have absolutely no idea,â said Reg brightly, âmuch of my memoryâs gone completely. I am very old, you see. Startlingly old. Yes, I think if I were to tell you how old I was it would be fair to say that you would be startled. Odds are that so would I, because I canât remember. Iâve seen an awful lot, you know. Forgotten most of it, thank God. Trouble is, when you start getting to my age, which, as I think I mentioned earlier, is a somewhat startling one -- did I say that?â
âYes, you did mention it.â
âGood. Iâd forgotten whether I had or not. The thing is that your memory doesnât actually get any bigger, and a lot of stuff just falls out. So you see, the major difference between someone of my age and someone of yours is not how much I know, but how much Iâve forgotten. And after a while you even forget what it is youâve forgotten, and after that you even forget that there was something to remember. Then you tend to forget, er, what it was you were talking about.â
He stared helplessly at the teapot.
âThings you remember...â prompted Richard gently. âSmells and earrings.â

âI beg your pardon?â
âThose are things that linger for some reason,â said Reg, shaking his head in a puzzled way. He sat down suddenly. âThe earrings that Queen Victoria wore on her Silver Jubilee. Quite startling objects. Toned down in the pictures of the period, of course. The smell of the streets before there were cars in them. Hard to say which was worse. Thatâs why Cleopatra remains so vividly in
the memory, of course. A quite devastating combination of earrings and smell. I think that will probably be the last thing that remains when all else has finally fled. I shall sit alone in a darkened room, sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything but a little grey old head, and in that little grey old head a peculiar vision of hideous blue and gold dangling things flashing in the light, and the smell of sweat, catfood and death. I wonder what I shall make of it...â
Dirk was scarcely breathing as he began to move slowly round the room, gently brushing his fingertips over the walls, the sofa, the table.
âHow long,â he said, âhas this been --ââHere?â said Reg. âJust about two hundred years. Ever since I retired.â
âRetired from what?â
âSearch me. Must have been something pretty good, though, what do you think?â
âYou mean youâve been in this same set of rooms here for... two hundred years?â murmured Richard. âYouâd think someone would notice, or think it was odd.â
âOh, thatâs one of the delights of the older Cambridge colleges,â said Reg, âeveryone is so discreet. If we all went around mentioning what was odd about each other weâd be here till Christmas. Svlad, er -- Dirk, my dear fellow, please donât touch that just at the moment.â
Dirkâs hand was reaching out to touch the abacus standing on its own on the only clear spot on the big table.

âWhat is it?â said Dirk sharply.
âItâs just what it looks like, an old wooden abacus,â said Reg. âIâll show you in a moment, but first I must congratulate you on your powers of perception. May I ask how you arrived at the solution?ââI have to admit,â said Dirk with rare humility, âthat I did not. In the end I asked a child. I told him the story of the trick and asked him how he thought it had been done, and he said and I quote, âItâs bleedinâ obvious, innit, he mustâve âad a bleedinâ time machine.â I thanked the little fellow and gave him a shilling for his trouble. He kicked me rather sharply on the shin and went about his business. But he was the one who solved it. My only contribution to the matter was to see that he must be right. He had even saved me the bother of kicking myself.â
âBut you had the perception to think of asking a child,â said Reg. âWell then, I congratulate you on that instead.â
Dirk was still eyeing the abacus suspiciously.
âHow... does it work?â he said, trying to make it sound like a casual enquiry.
âWell, itâs really terribly simple,â said Reg, âit works any way you want it to. You see, the computer that runs it is a rather advanced one. In fact it is more powerful than the sum total of all the computers on this planet including -- and this is the tricky part -- including itself. Never really understood that bit myself, to be honest with you. But over ninety-five per cent of that power is used in simply understanding what it is you want it to do. I simply plonk my abacus down there and it understands the way I use it. I think I must have been brought up to use an abacus when I was a... well, a child, I suppose.
âRichard, for instance, would probably want to use his own personal computer. If you put it down there, where the abacus is the machineâs computer would simple take charge of it and offer you lots of nice user-friendly time-travel applications complete with pull-down menus and desk accessories if you like. Except that you point to 1066 on the screen and youâve got the Battle of Hastings going on outside your door, er, if thatâs the sort of thing youâre

interested in.â
Regâs tone of voice suggested that his own interests lay in other areas.
âItâs, er, really quite fun in its way,â he concluded. âCertainly better than television and a great deal easier to use than a video recorder. If I miss a programme I just pop back in time and watch it. Iâm hopeless fiddling with all those buttons.â
Dirk reacted to this revelation with horror.
âYou have a time machine and you use it for... watching television?ââWell, I wouldnât use it at all if I could get the hang of the video recorder. Itâs a very delicate business, time travel, you know. Full of appalling traps and dangers, if you should change the wrong thing in the past, you could entirely disrupt the course of history.
âPlus, of course, it mucks up the telephone. Iâm sorry,â he said to Richard a little sheepishly, âthat you were unable to phone your young lady last night. There seems to be something fundamentally inexplicable about the British telephone system, and my time machine doesnât like it. Thereâs never any problem with the plumbing, the electricity, or even the gas. The connection interfaces are taken care of at some quantum level I donât entirely understand, and itâs never been a problem.
âThe phone on the other hand is definitely a problem. Every time I use the time machine, which is, of course, hardly at all, partly because of this very problem with the phone, the phone goes haywire and I have to get some lout from the phone company to come and fix it, and he starts asking stupid questions the answers to which he has no hope of understanding.
âAnyway, the point is that I have a very strict rule that I must not change anything in the past at all --â Reg sighed -- âwhatever the temptation.â
âWhat temptation?â said Dirk, sharply.
âOh, itâs just a little, er, thing Iâm interested in,â said Reg, vaguely, âit is

perfectly harmless because I stick very strictly to the rule. It makes me sad, though.â
âBut you broke your own rule!â insisted Dirk. âLast night! You changed something in the past --â
âWell, yes,â said Reg, a little uncomfortably, âbut that was different. Very different. If you had seen the look on the poor childâs face. So miserable. She thought the world should be a marvellous place, and all those appalling old dons were pouring their withering scorn on her just because it wasnât marvellous for them anymore.
âI mean,â he added, appealing to Richard, âremember Cawley. What a bloodless old goat. Someone should get some humanity into him even if they have to knock it in with a brick. No, that was perfectly justifiable. Otherwise, I make it a very strict rule --â
Richard looked at him with dawning recognition of something.
âReg,â he said politely, âmay I give you a little advice?â
âOf course you may, my dear fellow, I should adore you to,â said Reg.
âIf our mutual friend here offers to take you for a stroll along the banks of the River Cam, donât go.â
âWhat on earth do you mean?â
âHe means,â said Dirk earnestly, âthat he thinks there may be something a little disproportionate between what you actually did, and your stated reasons for doing it.â
âOh. Well, odd way of saying it --â
âWell, heâs a very odd fellow. But you see, there sometimes may be other reasons for things you do which you are not necessarily aware of. As in the case of post-hypnotic suggestion -- or possession.â

Reg turned very pale. âPossession --â he said.
âProfessor -- Reg -- I believe there was some reason you wanted to see me. What exactly was it?â
âCambridge! this is... Cambridge!â came the lilting squawk of the station public address system.
Crowds of noisy revellers spewed out on to the platform barking and honking at each other.
âWhereâs Rodney?â said one, who had clambered with difficulty from the carriage in which the bar was situated. He and his companion looked up and down the platform, totteringly. The large figure of Michael Wenton-Weakes loomed silently past them and out to the exit.
They jostled their way down the side of the train, looking in through the dirty carriage windows. They suddenly saw their missing companion still sitting, trance-like, in his seat in the now almost empty compartment. They banged on the window and hooted at him. For a moment or two he didnât react, and when he did he woke suddenly in a puzzled way as if seeming not to know where he was.
âHeâs pie-eyed!â his companions bawled happily, bundling themselves on to the train again and bundling Rodney back off.
He stood woozily on the platform and shook his head. Then glancing up he saw through the railings the large bulk of Michael Wenton-Weakes heaving himself and a large heavy bag into a taxi-cab, and he stood for a moment transfixed.
ââStraordinary thing,â he said, âthat man. Telling me a long story about some kind of shipwreck.â

âHar har,â gurgled one of his two companions, âget any money off you?â
âWhat?â said Rodney, puzzled. âNo. No, I donât think so. Except it wasnât a shipwreck, more an accident, an explosion -- ? He seems to think he caused it in some way. Or rather there was an accident, and he caused an explosion trying to put it right and killed everybody. Then he said there was an awful lot of rotting mud for years and years, and then slimy things with legs. It was all a bit peculiar.â
âTrust Rodney! Trust Rodney to pick a madman!â
âI think he must have been mad. He suddenly went off on a tangent about some bird. He said the bit about the bird was all nonsense. He wished he could get rid of the bit about the bird. But then he said it would be put right. It would all be put right. For some reason I didnât like it when he said that.â
âShould have come along to the bar with us. Terribly funny, we --â âI also didnât like the way he said goodbye. I didnât like that at all.â
CHAPTER 28
âYou remember,â said Reg, âwhen you arrived this afternoon I said that times recently had been dull, but for... interesting reasons?â
âI remember it vividly,â said Dirk, âit happened a mere ten minutes ago. You were standing exactly there as I recall. Indeed you were wearing the very clothes with which you are currently apparelled, and - -â
âShut up, Dirk,â said Richard, âlet the poor man talk, will you?â
Dirk made a slight, apologetic bow.
âQuite so,â said Reg. âWell, the truth is that for many weeks, months even, I

have not used the time machine at all, because I had the oddest feeling that someone or something was trying to make me do it. It started as the very faintest urge, and then it seemed to come at me in stronger and stronger waves. It was extremely disturbing. I had to fight it very hard indeed because it was trying to make me do something I actually wanted to do. I donât think I would have realised that it was something outside of me creating this pressure and not just my own wishes asserting themselves if it wasnât for the fact that I was so wary of allowing myself to do any such thing. As soon as I began to realise that it was something else trying to invade me things got really bad and
the furniture began to fly about. Quite damaged my little Georgian writing desk. Look at the marks on the --â
âIs that what you were afraid of last night, upstairs?â asked Richard.
âOh yes,â said Reg in a hushed voice, âmost terribly afraid. But it was only that rather nice horse, so that was all right. I expect it just wandered in when I was out getting some powder to cover up my suntan.â
âOh?â said Dirk, âAnd where did you go for that?â he asked. âI canât think of many chemists that a horse would be likely to visit.â
âOh, thereâs a planet off in whatâs known here as the Pleiades where the dust is exactly the right --â
âYou went,â said Dirk in a whisper, âto another planet? To get face powder?â
âOh, itâs no distance,â said Reg cheerfully. âYou see, the actual distance between two points in the whole of the space\time continuum is almost infinitely smaller than the apparent distance between adjacent orbits of an electron. Really, itâs a lot less far than the chemist, and thereâs no waiting about at the till. I never have the right change, do you? Go for the quantum jump is always my preference. Except of course that you then get all the trouble with the telephone. Nothingâs ever that easy, is it?â
He looked bothered for a moment.
âI think you may be right in what I think youâre thinking, though,â he added

quietly. âWhich is?â
âThat I went through a rather elaborate bit of business to achieve a very small result. Cheering up a little girl, charming, delightful and sad though she was, doesnât seem to be enough explanation for -- well, it was a fairly major operation in time-engineering, now that I come to face up to it. Thereâs no doubt that it would have been simpler to compliment her on her dress. Maybe the... ghost -- we are talking of a ghost here, arenât we?â
âI think we are, yes,â said Dirk slowly.
âA ghost?â said Richard, âNow come on --â
âWait!â said Dirk, abruptly. âPlease continue,â he said to Reg.
âItâs possible that the... ghost caught me off my guard. I was fighting so strenuously against doing one thing that it easily tripped me into another --â
âAnd now?â
âOh, itâs gone completely. The ghost left me last night.â
âAnd where, we wonder,â said Dirk, turning his gaze on Richard, âdid it go?â
âNo, please,â said Richard, ânot this. Iâm not even sure Iâve agreed weâre talking about time machines yet, and now suddenly itâs ghosts?â
âSo what was it,â hissed Dirk, âthat got into you to make you climb the wall?â
âWell, you suggested that I was under post-hypnotic suggestion from someone - -â
âI did not! I demonstrated the power of post-hypnotic suggestion to you. But I believe that hypnosis and possession work in very, very similar ways. You can be made to do all kinds of absurd things, and will then cheerfully invent

the most transparent rationalisations to explain them to yourself. But -- you cannot be made to do something that runs against the fundamental grain of your character. You will fight. You will resist!â
Richard remembered then the sense of relief with which he had impulsively replaced the tape in Susanâs machine last night. It had been the end of a struggle which he had suddenly won. With the sense of another struggle that he was now losing he sighed and related this to the others.
âExactly!â exclaimed Dirk. âYou wouldnât do it! Now weâre getting somewhere! You see, hypnosis works best when the subject has some fundamental sympathy with what he or she is being asked to do. Find the right subject for your task and the hypnosis can take a very, very deep hold indeed. And I believe the same to be true of possession. So. What do we have?
âWe have a ghost that wants something done and is looking for the right person to take possession of to do that for him. Professor --â
âReg --â said Reg.
âReg -- may I ask you something that may be terribly personal? I will understand perfectly if you donât want to answer, but I will just keep pestering you until you do. Just my methods, you see. You said there was something that you found to be a terrible temptation to you. That you wanted to do but would not allow yourself, and that the ghost was trying to make you do? Please. This may be difficult for you, but I think it would be very helpful if you would tell us what it is.â
âI will not tell you.â
âYou must understand how important --â âIâll show you instead,â said Reg.
Silhouetted in the gates of St Ceddâs stood a large figure carrying a large heavy black nylon bag. The figure was that of Michael Wenton-Weakes, the voice that asked the porter if Professor Chronotis was currently in his room was

that of Michael Wenton-Weakes, the ears that heard the porter say he was buggered if he knew because the phone seemed to be on the blink again was that of Michael Wenton-Weakes, but the spirit that gazed out of his eyes was his no longer.
He had surrendered himself completely. All doubt, disparity and confusion had ceased.
A new mind had him in full possession.
The spirit that was not Michael Wenton-Weakes surveyed the college which lay before it, to which it had grown accustomed in the last few frustrating, infuriating weeks.
Weeks! Mere microsecond blinks.
Although the spirit -- the ghost -- that now inhabited Michael Wenton- Weakesâ body had known long periods of near oblivion, sometimes even for centuries at a stretch, the time for which it had wandered the earth was such that it seemed only minutes ago that the creatures which had erected these walls had arrived. Most of his personal eternity -- not really eternity, but a few billion years could easily seem like it -- had been spent wandering across interminable mud, wading through ceaseless seas, watching with stunned horror when the slimy things with legs suddenly had begun to crawl from those rotting seas -- and here they were, suddenly walking around as if they
owned the place and complaining about the phones.
Deep in a dark and silent part of himself he knew that he was now mad, had been driven mad almost immediately after the accident by the knowledge of what he had done and of the existence he faced, by the memories of his fellows who had died and who for a while had haunted him even as he had haunted the Earth.
He knew that what he now had been driven to would have revolted the self he only infinitesimally remembered, but that it was the only way for him to end the ceaseless nightmare in which each second of billions of years had been worse than the previous one.

He hefted the bag and started to walk.
CHAPTER 29
Deep in the rain forest it was doing what it usually does in rain forests, which was raining: hence the name.
It was a gentle, persistent rain, not the heavy slashing which would come later in the year, in the hot season. It formed a fine dripping mist through which the occasional shaft of sunlight would break, be softened and pass through on its way towards the wet bark of a calvaria tree on which it would settle and glisten. Sometimes it would do this next to a butterfly or a tiny motionless sparkling lizard, and then the effect would be almost unbearable.
Away up in the high canopy of the trees an utterly extraordinary thought would suddenly strike a bird, and it would go flapping wildly through the branches and settle at last in a different and altogether better tree where it would sit and consider things again more calmly until the same thought came along and struck it again, or it was time to eat.
The air was full of scents -- the light fragrance of flowers, and the heavy odour of the sodden mulch with which the floor of the forest was carpeted.
Confusions of roots tangled through the mulch, moss grew on them, insects crawled.
In a space in the forest, on an empty patch of wet ground between a circle of craning trees, appeared quietly and without fuss a plain white door. After a few seconds it opened a little way with a slight squeak. A tall thin man looked out, looked around, blinked in surprise, and quietly pulled the door closed again.
A few seconds later the door opened again and Reg looked out.

âItâs real,â he said, âI promise you. Come out and see for yourself.â Walking out into the forest, he turned and beckoned the other two to follow him.
Dirk stepped boldly through, seemed disconcerted for about the length of time it takes to blink twice, and then announced that he saw exactly how it worked, that it was obviously to do with the unreal numbers that lay between minimum quantum distances and defined the fractal contours of the enfolded Universe and he was only astonished at himself for not having thought of it himself.
âLike the catflap,â said Richard from the doorway behind him.
âEr, yes, quite so,â said Dirk, taking off his spectacles and leaning against a tree wiping them, âyou spotted of course that I was lying. A perfectly natural reflex in the circumstances as I think youâll agree. Perfectly natural.â He squinted slightly and put his spectacles back on. They began to mist up again almost immediately.
âAstounding,â he admitted.
Richard stepped through more hesitantly and stood rocking for a moment with one foot still on the floor in Regâs room and the other on the wet earth of the forest. Then he stepped forward and committed himself fully.
His lungs instantly filled with the heady vapours and his mind with the wonder of the place. He turned and looked at the doorway through which he had walked. It was still a perfectly ordinary door frame with a perfectly ordinary little white door swinging open in it, but it was standing free in the open forest, and through it could clearly he seen the room he had just stepped out of.
He walked wonderingly round the back of the door, testing each foot on the muddy ground, not so much for fear of slipping as for fear that it might simply not be there. From behind it was just a perfectly ordinary open door frame, such as you might fail to find in any perfectly ordinary rain forest. He walked through the door from behind, and looking back again could once more see, as if he had just stepped out of them again, the college rooms of Professor Urban

Chronotis of St Ceddâs College, Cambridge, which must be thousands of miles away. Thousands? Where were they?
He peered off through the trees and thought he caught a slight shimmer in the distance, between the trees.
âIs that the sea?â he asked.
âYou can see it a little more clearly from up here,â called Reg, who had walked on a little way up a slippery incline and was now leaning, puffing, against a tree. He pointed.
The other two followed him up, pulling themselves noisily through the branches and causing a lot of cawing and complaining from unseen birds high above.
âThe Pacific?â asked Dirk.
âThe Indian Ocean,â said Reg.
Dirk wiped his glasses again and had another look. âAh, yes, of course,â he said.
âNot Madagascar?â said Richard. âIâve been there --â
âHave you?â said Reg. âOne of the most beautiful and astonishing places on Earth, and one that is also full of the most appalling... temptations for me. No.â
His voice trembled slightly, and he cleared his throat.
âNo,â he continued, âMadagascar is -- let me see, which direction are we -- whereâs the sun? Yes. That way. Westish. Madagascar is about five hundred miles roughly west of here. The island of RÃ©union lies roughly in-between.â
âEr, whatâs the place called?â said Dirk suddenly, rapping his knuckles on

the tree and frightening a lizard. âPlace where that stamp comes from, er -- Mauritius.â
âStamp?â said Reg.
âYes, you must know,â said Dirk, âvery famous stamp. Canât remember anything about it, but it comes from here. Mauritius. Famous for its very remarkable stamp, all brown and smudged and you could buy Blenheim Palace with it. Or am I thinking of British Guiana?â
âOnly you,â said Richard, âknow what you are thinking of.â âIs it Mauritius?â
âIt is,â said Reg, âit is Mauritius.â
âBut you donât collect stamps?â
âNo.â
âWhat on earthâs that?â said Richard suddenly, but Dirk carried on with his thought to Reg, âPity, you could get some nice first-day covers, couldnât you?â
Reg shrugged. âNot really interested,â he said. Richard slithered back down the slope behind them.
âSo whatâs the great attraction here?â said Dirk. âItâs not, I have to confess, what I was expecting. Very nice in its way, of course, all this nature, but Iâm a city boy myself, Iâm afraid.â He cleaned his glasses once again and pushed them back up his nose.
He started backwards at what he saw, and heard a strange little chuckle from Reg. Just in front of the door back into Regâs room, the most extraordinary confrontation was taking place.

A large cross bird was looking at Richard and Richard was looking at a large cross bird. Richard was looking at the bird as if it was the most extraordinary thing he had ever seen in his life, and the bird was looking at Richard as if defying him to find its beak even remotely funny.
Once it had satisfied itself that Richard did not intend to laugh, the bird regarded him instead with a sort of grim irritable tolerance and wondered if
he was just going to stand there or actually do something useful and feed it. It padded a couple of steps back and a couple of steps to the side and then just a single step forward again, ongreat waddlingyellow feet. It then looked athim again, impatiently, and squarked an impatient squark.
The bird then bent forward and scraped its great absurd red beak across the ground as if to give Richard the idea that this might be a good area to look for things to give it to eat.
âIt eats the nuts of the calvaria tree,â called out Reg to Richard.The big bird looked sharply up at Reg in annoyance, as if to say that it was perfectly clear to any idiot what it ate. It then looked back at Richard once more and stuck its head on one side as if it had suddenly been struck by the thought that perhaps it was an idiot it had to deal with, and that it might need to reconsider its strategy accordingly.
âThere are one or two on the ground behind you,â called Reg softly.In a trance of astonishment Richard turned awkwardly and saw one or two large nuts lying on the ground. He bent and picked one up, glancing up at Reg, who gave him a reassuring nod.
Tentatively Richard held the thing out to the bird, which leant forward and pecked it sharply from between his fingers. Then, because Richardâs hand was still stretched out, the bird knocked it irritably aside with its beak.
Once Richard had withdrawn to a respectful distance, it stretched its neck up, closed its large yellow eyes and seemed to gargle gracelessly as it shook the nut down its neck into its maw.
It appeared then to be at least partially satisfied. Whereas before it had been a

cross dodo, it was at least now a cross, fed dodo, which was probably about as much as it could hope for in this life.
It made a slow, waddling, on-the-spot turn and padded back into the forest whence it had come, as if defying Richard to find the little tuft of curly feathers stuck up on top of its backside even remotely funny.
âI only come to look,â said Reg in a small voice, and glancing at him Dirk was discomfited to see that the old manâs eyes were brimming with tears which he quickly brushed away. âReally, it is not for me to interfere --â
Richard came scurrying breathlessly up to them. âWas that a dodo?â he exclaimed.
âYes,â said Reg, âone of only three left at this time. The year is 1676. They will all be dead within four years, and after that no one will ever see them again. Come,â he said, âlet us go.â
Behind the stoutly locked outer door in the corner staircase in the Second Court of St Ceddâs College, where only a millisecond earlier there had been a slight flicker as the inner door departed, there was another slight flicker as the inner door now returned.
Walking through the dark evening towards it the large figure of Michael Wenton-Weakes looked up at the corner windows. If any slight flicker had been visible, it would have gone unnoticed in the dim dancing firelight that spilled from the window.
The figure then looked up into the darkness of the sky, looking for what it knew to be there though there was not the slightest chance of seeing it, even on a clear night which this was not. The orbits of Earth were now so cluttered with pieces of junk and debris that one more item among them -- even such a large one as this was -- would pass perpetually unnoticed. Indeed, it had done
so, though its influence had from time to time exerted itself. From time to time. When the waves had been strong. Not for nearly two hundred years had they been so strong as now they were again.

And all at last was now in place. The perfect carrier had been found. The perfect carrier moved his footsteps onwards through the court.
The Professor himself had seemed the perfect choice at first, but that attempt had ended in frustration, fury, and then -- inspiration! Bring a Monk to Earth! They were designed to believe anything, to be completely malleable. It could be suborned to undertake the task with the greatest of ease.
Unfortunately, however, this onehad proved to be completely hopeless. Getting it to believe something was very easy. Getting it to continue to believe the same thing for more than five minutes at a time had proved to be an even more impossible task than that of getting the Professor to do what he fundamentally wanted to do but wouldnât allow himself.
Then another failure and then, miraculously, the perfect carrier had come at last.
The perfect carrier had already proved that it would have no compunction in doing what would have to be done.
Damply, clogged in mist, the moon struggled in a corner of the sky to rise. At the window, a shadow moved.
CHAPTER 30
From the window overlooking Second Court Dirk watched the moon. âWe shall not,â he said, âhave long to wait.â
âTo wait for what?â said Richard. Dirk turned.

âFor the ghost,â he said, âto return to us. Professor --â he added to Reg, who was sitting anxiously by the fire, âdo you have any brandy, French cigarettes or worry beads in your rooms?â
âNo,â said Reg.
âThen I shall have to fret unaided,â said Dirk and returned to staring out of the window.
âI have yet to be convinced,â said Richard, âthat there is not some other explanation than that of... ghosts to --â
âJust as you required actually to see a time machine in operation before you could accept it,â returned Dirk. âRichard, I commend you on your scepticism, but even the sceptical mind must be prepared to accept the unacceptable when there is no alternative. If it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, we have at least to consider the possibility that we have a small aquatic bird of the family Anatidae on our hands.ââThen what is a ghost?â
âI think that a ghost...â said Dirk, âis someone who died either violently or unexpectedly with unfinished business on his, her -- or its -- hands. Who cannot rest until it has been finished, or put right.â
He turned to face them again.
âWhich is why,â he said, âa time machine would have such a fascination for a ghost once it knew of its existence. A time machine provides the means to put right what, in the ghostâs opinion, went wrong in the past. To free it.
âWhich is why it will be back. It tried first to take possession of Reg himself, but he resisted. Then came the incident with the conjuring trick, the face powder and the horse in the bathroom which I --â he paused -- âwhich even I do not understand, though I intend to if it kills me. And then you, Richard, appear on the scene. The ghost deserts Reg and concentrates instead on you. Almost immediately there occurs an odd but significant incident. You do something that you then wish you hadnât done.

âI refer, of course, to the phone call you made to Susan and left on her answering machine.
âThe ghost seizes its chance and tries to induce you to undo it. To, as it were, go back into the past and erase that message -- to change the mistake you had made. Just to see if you would do it. Just to see if it was in your character.
âIf it had been, you would now be totally under its control. But at the very last second your nature rebelled and you would not do it. And so the ghost gives you up as a bad job and deserts you in turn. It must find someone else.
âHow long has it been doing this? I do not know. Does this now make sense to you? Do you recognise the truth of what I am saying?â
Richard turned cold.
âYes,â he said, âI think you must be absolutely right.â
âAnd at what moment, then,â said Dirk, âdid the ghost leave you?â Richard swallowed.
âWhen Michael Wenton-Weakes walked out of the room,â he said.
âSo I wonder,â said Dirk quietly, âwhat possibilities the ghost saw in him. I wonder whether this time it found what it wanted. I believe we shall not have long to wait.â
There was a knock on the door.
When it opened, there stood Michael Wenton-Weakes.
He said simply, âPlease, I need your help.â
Reg and Richard stared at Dirk, and then at Michael.
âDo you mind if I put this down somewhere?â said Michael. âItâs rather

heavy. Full of scuba-diving equipment.â
âOh, I see,â said Susan, âoh well, thanks, Nicola, Iâll try that fingering. Iâm sure he only put the E flat in there just to annoy people. Yes, Iâve been at
it solidly all afternoon. Some of those semiquaver runs in the second movement are absolute bastards. Well, yes, it helped take my mind off it all. No, no news. Itâs all just mystifying and absolutely horrible. I donât want even to -- look, maybe Iâll give you a call again later and see how youâre feeling. I know, yes, you never know whichis worse, do you, the illness, the antibiotics, or the doctorâs bedside manner. Look after yourself, or at least, make sure Simon does. Tell him to bring you gallons of hot lemon. OK. Well, Iâll talk to you later. Keep warm. Bye now.â
She put the phone down and returned to her cello. She had hardly started to reconsider the problem of the irritating E flat when the phone went again. She had simply left it off the hook for the afternoon, but had forgotten to do so again after making her own call.With a sigh she propped up the cello, put down the bow, and went to the phone again.
âHello?â she demanded.
Again, there was nothing, just a distant cry of wind. Irritably, she slammed the receiver back down once more.
She waited a few seconds for the line to clear, and then was about to take the phone off the hook once more when she realised that perhaps Richard might need her.
She hesitated.
She admitted to herself that she hadnât been using the answering machine, because she usually just put it on for Gordonâs convenience, and that was something of which she did not currently wish to be reminded.
Still, she put the answering machine on, turned the volume right down, and returned again to the E flat that Mozart had put in only to annoy cellists.

In the darkness of the offices of Dirk Gentlyâs Holistic Detective Agency, Gordon Way clumsily fumbled the telephone receiver back on to its rest and sat slumped in the deepest dejection. He didnât even stop himself slumping all the way through the seat until he rested lightly on the floor.
Miss Pearce had fled the office the first time the telephone had started actually using itself, her patience with all this sort of thing finally exhausted again, since which time Gordon had had the office to himself.However, hisattempts to contactanybody hadfailed completely.
Or rather, his attempts to contact Susan, which was all he cared about. It was Susan he had been speaking to when he died and he knew he had somehow to speak to her again. But she had left her phone off the hook most of the afternoon and even when she had answered she could not hear him.
He gave up. He roused himself from the floor, stood up, and slipped out and down into the darkening streets. He drifted aimlessly for a while, went for a walk on the canal, which was a trick that palled very quickly, and then wandered back up to the street again.
The houses with light and life streaming from them upset him most particularly since the welcome they seemed to extend would not be extended to him. He wondered if anyone would mind if he simply slipped into their house and watched television for the evening. He wouldnât be any trouble.
Or a cinema.
That would be better, he could go to the cinema.
He turned with more positive, if still insubstantial, footsteps into Noel Road and started to walk up it.
Noel Road, he thought. It rang a vague bell. He had a feeling that he had recently had some dealings with someone in Noel Road. Who was it?
His thoughts were interrupted by a terrible scream of horror that rang through the street. He stood stock still. A few seconds later a door flew open a few

yards from him and a woman ran out of it, wild-eyed and howling.
CHAPTER 31
Richard had never liked Michael Wenton-Weakes and he liked him even less with a ghost in him. He couldnât say why, he had nothing against ghosts personally, didnât think a person should be judged adversely simply for being dead, but -- he didnât like it.
Nevertheless, it was hard not to feel a little sorry for him.
Michael sat forlornly on a stool with his elbow resting on the large table and his head resting on his fingers. He looked ill and haggard. He looked deeply
tired. He looked pathetic. His story had been a harrowing one, and concluded with his attempts to possess first Reg and then Richard.
âYou were,â he concluded, âright. Entirely.â
He said this last to Dirk, and Dirk grimaced as if trying not to beam with triumph too many times in a day.
The voice was Michaelâs and yet it was not Michaelâs. Whatever timbre a voice acquires through a billion or so years of dread and isolation, this voice had acquired it, and it filled those who heard it with a dizzying chill akin to that which clutches the mind and stomach when standing on a cliff at night.
He turned his eyes on Reg and on Richard, and the effect of the eyes, too, was one that provoked pity and terror. Richard had to look away.
âI owe you both an apology,â said the ghost within Michael âwhich I offer you from the depths of my heart, and only hope that as you come to understand the desperation of my predicament, and the hope which this machine offers me, you will understand why I have acted as I have, and that you will find it within yourselves to forgive me. And to help me. I beg you.â

âGive the man a whisky,â said Dirk gruffly.
âHavenât got any whisky,â said Reg. âEr, port? Thereâs a bottle or so of Margaux I could open. Very fine one. Should be chambrÃ©d for an hour, but I can do that of course, itâs very easy, I --â
âWill you help me?â interrupted the ghost.
Reg bustled to fetch some port and some glasses.
âWhy have you taken over the body of this man?â said Dirk.
âI need to have a voice with which to speak and a body with which to act. No harm will come to him, no harm --â
âLet me ask the question again. Why have you taken over the body of this man?â insisted Dirk.
The ghost made Michaelâs body shrug.
âHe was willing. Both of these two gentlemen quite understandably resisted being... well, hypnotised -- your analogy is fair. This one? Well, I think his sense of self is at a low ebb, and he has acquiesced. I am very grateful to him and will not do him any harm.â
âHis sense of self,â repeated Dirk thoughtfully, âis at a low ebb.ââI suppose that is probably true,â said Richard quietly to Dirk. âHe seemed very depressed last night. The one thing that was important to him had been taken away because he, well, he wasnât really very good at it. Although heâs proud I expect he was probably quite receptive to the idea of actually being wanted for something.â
âHmmm,â said Dirk, and said it again. He said it a third time with feeling. Then he whirled round and barked at the figure on the stool.
âMichael Wenton-Weakes!â

Michaelâs head jolted back and he blinked.
âYes?â he said, in his normal lugubrious voice. His eyes followed Dirk as he moved.
âYou can hear me,â said Dirk, âand you can answer for yourself?â âOh, yes,â said Michael, âmost certainly I can.â
âThis... being, this spirit. You know he is in you? You accept his presence? You are a willing party to what he wishes to do?â
âThat is correct. I was much moved by his account of himself, and am very willing to help him. In fact I think it is right for me to do so.ââAll right,â said Dirk with a snap of his fingers, âyou can go.â
Michaelâs head slumped forward suddenly, and then after a second or so it slowly rose again, as if being pumped up from inside like a tyre.The ghost was back in possession.
Dirk took hold of a chair, spun it round and sat astride it facing the ghost in Michael, peering intently into its eyes.
âAgain,â he said, âtell me again. A quick snap account.â
Michaelâs body tensed slightly. It reached out to Dirkâs arm.
âDonât -- touch me!â snapped Dirk. âJust tell me the facts. The first time you try and make me feel sorry for you Iâll poke you in the eye. Or at least, the one youâve borrowed. So leave out all the stuff that sounded like... er --â
âColeridge,â saidRichard suddenly, âitsounded exactly like Coleridge. It was like âThe Rime of the Ancient Marinerâ. Well bits of it were.â
Dirk frowned. âColeridge?â he said.
âI tried to tell him my story,â admitted the ghost, âI --â

âSorry,â said Dirk, âyouâll have to excuse me -- Iâve never cross-examined a four-billion-year-old ghost before. Are we talking Samuel Taylor here? Are you saying you told your story to Samuel Taylor Coleridge?â
âI was able to enter his mind at... certain times. When he was in an impressionable state.â
âYou mean when he was on laudanum?â said Richard. âThat is correct. He was more relaxed then.â
âIâll say,â snorted Reg, âI sometimes encountered him when he was quite astoundingly relaxed. Look, Iâll make some coffee.â
He disappeared into the kitchen, where he could be heard laughing to himself.
âItâs another world,â muttered Richard to himself, sitting down and shaking his head.
âBut unfortunately when he was fully in possession of himself I, so to speak, was not,â said the ghost, âand so that failed. And what he wrote was very garbled.â
âDiscuss,â said Richard, to himself, raising his eyebrows.
âProfessor,â called out Dirk, âthis may sound absurd. Did -- Coleridge ever try to... er... use your time machine? Feel free to discuss the question in any way which appeals to you.â
âWell, do you know,â said Reg, looking round the door, âhe did come in prying around on one occasion, but I think he was in a great deal too relaxed a state to do anything.â
âI see,â said Dirk. âBut why,â he added turning back to the strange figure of Michael slumped on its stool, âwhy has it taken you so long to find someone?â

âFor long, long periods I am very weak, almost totally non-existent, and unable to influence anything at all. And then, of course, before that time there was no time machine here, and... no hope for me at all --â
âPerhaps ghosts exist like wave patterns,â suggested Richard, âlike interference patterns between the actual with the possible. There would be irregular peaks and troughs, like in a musical waveform.â
The ghost snapped Michaelâs eyes around to Richard. âYou...â he said, âyou wrote that article...â
âEr, yes --â
âIt moved me very greatly,â said the ghost, with a sudden remorseful longing in his voice which seemed to catch itself almost as much by surprise as it did its listeners.
âOh. I see,â said Richard, âWell, thank you. You didnât like it so much last time you mentioned it. Well, I know that wasnât you as such - -â
Richard sat back frowning to himself.
âSo,â said Dirk, âto return to the beginning --â
The ghost gathered Michaelâs breath for him and started again. âWe were on a ship --â it said.
âA spaceship.â
âYes. Out from Salaxala, a world in... well, very far from here. A violent and troubled place. We -- a party of some nine dozen of us -- set out, as people frequently did, to find a new world for ourselves. All the planets in this system were completely unsuitable for our purpose, but we stopped on this world to replenish some necessary mineral supplies.
âUnfortunately our landing ship was damaged on its way into the

atmosphere. Damaged quite badly, but still quite reparable.
âI was the engineer on board and it fell to me to supervise the task of repairing the ship and preparing it to return to our main ship. Now, in order to
understand what happened next you must know something of the nature of a highly-automated society. There is no task that cannot be done more easily with the aid of advanced computerisation. And there were some very specific problems associated with a trip with an aim such as ours --â
âWhich was?â said Dirk sharply.
The ghost in Michael blinked as if the answer was obvious.
âWell, to find a new and better world on which we could all live in freedom, peace and harmony forever, of course,â he said.
Dirk raised his eyebrows.
âOh, that,â he said. âYouâd thought this all out carefully, I assume.â
âWeâd had it thought out for us. We had with us some very specialised devices for helping us to continue to believe in the purpose of the trip even when things got difficult. They generally worked very well, but I think we probably came to rely on them too much.â
âWhat on earth were they?â said Dirk.
âItâs probably hard for you to understand how reassuring they were. And that was why I made my fatal mistake. When I wanted to know whether or not it was safe to take off, I didnât want to know that it might not be safe. I just wanted to be reassured that it was. So instead of checking it myself, you see, I sent out one of the Electric Monks.â
CHAPTER 32
The brass plaque on the red door in Peckender Street glittered as it reflected the

yellow light of a street lamp. It glared for a moment as it reflected the violent flashing light of a passing police car sweeping by.
It dimmed slightly as a pale, pale wraith slipped silently through it. It glimmered as it dimmed, because the wraith was trembling with such terrible agitation.
In the dark hallway the ghost of Gordon Way paused. He needed something to lean on for support, and of course there was nothing. He tried to get a grip on himself, but there was nothing to get a grip on. He retched at the horror of what he had seen, but there was, of course, nothing in his stomach. He half stumbled, half swam up the stairs, like a drowning man trying to grapple for a grip on the water.
He staggered through the wall, through the desk, through the door, and tried to compose and settle himself in front of the desk in Dirkâs office.
If anyone had happened into the office a few minutes later -- a night cleaner perhaps, if Dirk Gently had ever employed one, which he didnât on the
grounds that they wished to be paid and he did not wish to pay them, or a burglar, perhaps, if there had been anything in the office worth burgling, which there wasnât -- they would have seen the following sight and been amazed by it.
The receiver of the large red telephone on the desk suddenly rocked and tumbled off its rest on to the desk top.
A dialling tone started to burr. Then, one by one, seven of the large, easily pushed buttons depressed themselves, and after the very long pause which the British telephone system allows you within which to gather your thoughts and forget who it is youâre phoning, the sound of a phone ringing at the other end of the line could be heard.
After a couple of rings there was a click, a whirr, and a sound as of a machine drawing breath. Then a voice started to say, âHello, this is Susan. I canât come to the phone right at the moment because Iâm trying to get an E flat right, but if youâd like to leave your name...â

âSo then, on the say so of an -- I can hardly bring myself to utter the words -- Electric Monk,â said Dirk in a voice ringing with derision, âyouattempt to launch theship and to yourutter astonishment it explodes. Since when -- ?â
âSince when,â said the ghost, abjectly, âI have been alone on this planet. Alone with the knowledge of what I had done to my fellows on the ship. All, all alone...â
âYes, skip that, I said,â snapped Dirk angrily. âWhat about the main ship? That presumably went on and continued its search for --â
âNo.â
âThen what happened to it?â
âNothing. Itâs still there.â
âStill there?â
Dirk leapt to his feet and whirled off to pace the room, his brow furiously furrowed.
âYes.â Michaelâs head drooped a little, but he looked up pitieously at Reg and at Richard. âAll of us were aboard the landing craft. At first I felt myself to be haunted by the ghosts of the rest, but it was only in my imagination. For millions of years, and then billions, I stalked the mud utterly alone. It is impossible for you to conceive of even the tiniest part of the torment of such eternity. Then,â he added, âjust recently life arose on the planet. Life. Vegetation, things in the sea, then, at last, you. Intelligent life. I turn to you to release me from the torment I have endured.â
Michaelâs head sank abjectly on to his chest for some few seconds. Then slowly, wobblingly, it rose and stared at them again, with yet darker fires in his eyes.
âTake me back,â he said, âI beg you, take me back to the landing craft. Let me

undo what was done. A word from me, and it can be undone, the repairs properly made, the landing craft can then return to the main ship, we can be on our way, my torment will be extinguished, and I will cease to be a burden to you. I beg you.â
There was a short silence while his plea hung in the air.
âBut that canât work, can it?â said Richard. âIf we do that, then this wonât have happened. Donât we generate all sorts of paradoxes?â
Reg stirred himself from thought. âNo worse than many that exist already,â he said. âIf the Universe came to an end every time there was some uncertainty about what had happened in it, it would never have got beyond the first picosecond. And many of course donât. Itâs like a human body, you see. A few cuts and bruises here and there donât hurt it. Not even major surgery if itâs done properly. Paradoxes are just the scar tissue. Time and space heal themselves up around them and people simply remember a version of events which makes as much sense as they require it to make.
âThat isnât to say that if you get involved in a paradox a few things wonât strike you as being very odd, but if youâve got through life without that already happening to you, then I donât know which Universe youâve been living in, but it isnât this one.â
âWell, if thatâs the case,â said Richard, âwhy were you so fierce about not doing anything to save the dodo?â
Reg sighed. âYou donât understand at all. The dodo wouldnât have died if I hadnât worked so hard to save the coelacanth.â
âThe coelacanth? The prehistoric fish? But how could one possibly affect the other?â
âAh. Now there youâre asking. The complexities of cause and effect defy analysis. Not only is the continuum like a human body, it is also very like a piece of badly put up wallpaper. Push down a bubble somewhere, another one pops up somewhere else. There are no more dodos because of my

interference. In the end I imposed the rule on myself because I simply couldnât bear it any more. The only thing that really gets hurt when you try and change time is yourself.â He smiled bleakly, and looked away.
Then he added, after a long momentâs reflection, âNo, it can be done. Iâm just cynical because itâs gone wrong so many times. This poor fellowâs story is a very pathetic one, and it can do no harm to put an end to his misery. It happened so very, very long ago on a dead planet. If we do this we will each remember whatever it is that has happened to us individually. Too bad if the rest of the world doesnât quite agree. It will hardly be the first time.â
Michaelâs head bowed.
âYouâre very silent, Dirk,â said Richard.
Dirk glared angrily at him. âI want to see this ship,â he demanded.
In the darkness, the red telephone receiver slipped and slid fitfully back across the desk. If anybody had been there to see it they might just have discerned a shape that moved it.
It shone only very faintly, less than would the hands of a luminous watch. It seemed more as if the darkness around it was just that much darker and the ghostly shape sat within it like thickened scar tissue beneath the surface of the night.
Gordon grappled one last time with the recalcitrant receiver. At length he got a final grip and slipped it up on to the top of the instrument.
From there it fell back on to its rest and disconnected the call. At the same moment the ghost of Gordon Way, his last call finally completed, fell back to his own rest and vanished.
CHAPTER 33
Swinging slowly round in the shadow of the Earth, just one more piece of

debris among that which floated now forever in high orbit, was one dark shape that was larger and more regularly formed than the rest. And far, far older.
For four billion years it had continued to absorb data from the world below it, scanning, analysing, processing. Occasionally it sent pieces back if it thought they would help, if it thought they might be received. But otherwise, it watched, it listened, it recorded. Not the lapping of a wave nor the beating of a heart escaped its attention.
Otherwise, nothing inside it had moved for four billion years, except for the air which circulated still, and the motes of dust within the air that danced and danced and danced and danced... and danced.
It was only a very slight disturbance that occurred now. Quietly, without fuss, like a dew drop precipitating from the air on to a leaf, there appeared in a wall which had stood blank and grey for four billion years, a door. A plain, ordinary white-panelled door with a small dented brass handle.
This quiet event, too, was recordedand incorporated in the continual stream ofdataprocessingthat the ship ceaselessly performed. Not only the arrival of the door, but the arrival of those behind the door, the way they looked, the way they moved, the way they felt about being there. All processed, all recorded, all transformed.
After a moment or two had passed, the door opened.
Within it could be seen a room unlike any on the ship. A room of wooden floors, of shabby upholstery, a room in which a fire danced. And as the fire danced, its data danced within the shipâs computers, and the motes of dust in the air also danced with it.
A figure stood in the doorway -- a large lugubrious figure with a strange light that danced now in its eyes. It stepped forward across the threshold into the ship, and its face was suddenly suffused with a calm for which it had longed but had thought never again to experience.Following him stepped out a smaller, older man with hair that was white and wayward. He stopped and blinked with wonder as he passed from out of the realm of his room and into

the realm of the ship. Following him came a third man, impatient and tense, with a large leather overcoat that flapped about him. He, too, stopped and was momentarily bewildered by something he didnât understand. With a look of deepest puzzlement on his face he walked forward and looked around at the grey and dusty walls of the ancient ship.
At last came a fourth man, tall and thin. He stooped as he walked out of the door, and then instantly stopped as if he had walked into a wall.
He had walked into a wall, of a kind.
He stood transfixed. If anyone had been looking at his face at that moment, it would have been abundantly clear to them that the single most astonishing event of this manâs entire existence was currently happening to him.
When slowly he began to move it was with a curious gait, as if he was swimming very slowly. Each tiniest movement of his head seemed to bring fresh floods of awe and astonishment into his face. Tears welled in his eyes, and he became breathless with gasping wonder.
Dirk turned to look at him, to hurry him along. âWhatâs the matter?â he called above the noise. âThe... music...â whispered Richard.
The air was full of music. So full it seemed there was room for nothing else. And each particle of air seemed to have its own music, so that as Richard moved his head he heard a new and different music, though the new and different music fitted quite perfectly with the music that lay beside it in the air.
The modulations from one to another were perfectly accomplished -- astonishing leaps to distant keys made effortlessly in the mere shifting of the head. New themes, new strands of melody, all perfectly and astoundingly proportioned, constantly involved themselves into the continuing web. Huge slow waves of movement, faster dances that thrilled through them, tiny

scintillating scampers that danced on the dances, long tangled tunes whose ends were so like their beginnings that they twisted around upon themselves, turned inside out, upside down, and then rushed off again on the back of yet another dancing melody in a distant part of the ship.
Richard staggered against the wall. Dirk hurried to grab him.
âCome on,â he said, brusquely, âwhatâs the matter? Canât you stand the music? Itâs a bit loud, isnât it? For Godâs sake, pull yourself together. Thereâs something here I still donât understand. Itâs not right. Come on --â
He tugged Richard after him, and then had to support him as Richardâs mind sank further and further under the overwhelming weight of music. The visions that were woven in his mind by the million thrilling threads of music as they were pulled through it, were increasingly a welter of chaos, but the more the chaos burgeoned the more it fitted with the other chaos, and the next greater chaos, until it all became a vast exploding ball of harmony expanding in his mind faster than any mind could deal with.
And then it was all much simpler.
A single tune danced through his mind and all his attention rested upon it. It was a tune that seethed through the magical flood, shaped it, formed it, lived through it hugely, lived through it minutely, was its very essence. It bounced and trilled along, at first a little tripping tune, then it slowed, then it danced again but with more difficulty, seemed to founder in eddies of doubt and confusion, and then suddenly revealed that the eddies were just the first ripples of a huge new wave of energy surging up joyfully from beneath.
Richard began very, very slowly to faint.
He lay very still.
He felt he was an old sponge steeped in paraffin and left in the sun to dry.

He felt like the body of an old horse burning hazily in the sun. He dreamed of oil, thin and fragrant, of dark heaving seas. He was on a white beach, drunk with fish, stupefied with sand, bleached, drowsing, pummelled with light, sinking, estimating the density of vapour clouds in distant nebulae, spinning with dead delight. He was a pump spouting fresh water in the springtime, gushing into a mound of reeking newmown grass. Sounds, almost unheard, burned away like distant sleep.
He ran and was falling. The lights of a harbour spun into night. The sea like a dark spirit slapped infinitesimally at the sand, glimmering, unconscious. Out where it was deeper and colder he sank easily with the heavy sea swelling like oil around his ears, and was disturbed only by a distant burr burr as of the phone ringing.
He knew he had been listening to the music of life itself. The music of light dancing on water that rippled with the wind and the tides, of the life that moved through the water, of the life that moved on the land, warmed by the light.
He continued to lie very still. He continued to be disturbed by a distant burr burr as of a phone ringing.
Gradually he became aware that the distant burr burr as of a phone ringing was a phone ringing.
He sat up sharply.
He was lying on a small crumpled bed in a small untidy panelled room that he knew he recognised but couldnât place. It was cluttered with books and shoes. He blinked at it and was blank.
The phone by the bed was ringing. He picked it up. âHello?â he said.
âRichard!â It was Susanâs voice, utterly distraught. He shook his head and had no recollection of anything useful.

âHello?â he said again.
âRichard, is that you? Where are you?â
âEr, hold on, Iâll go and look.â
He put the receiver down on the crumpled sheets, where it lay squawking, climbed shakily off the bed, staggered to the door and opened it.
Here was a bathroom. He peered at it suspiciously. Again, he recognised it but felt that there was something missing. Oh yes. There should be a horse in it. Or at least, there had been a horse in it the last time he had seen it. He crossed the bathroom floor and went out of the other door. He found his way shakily down the stairs and into Regâs main room.
He was surprised by what he saw when he got there.
CHAPTER 34
The storms of the day before, and of the day before that, and the floods of the previous week, had now abated. The skies still bulged with rain, but all that actually fell in the gathering evening gloom was a dreary kind of prickle.
Some wind whipped across the darkening plain, blundered through the low hills and gusted across a shallow valley where stood a structure, a kind of tower, alone in a nightmare of mud, and leaning.
It was a blackened stump of a tower. It stood like an extrusion of magma from one of the more pestilential pits of hell, and it leaned at a peculiar angle, as if oppressed by something altogether more terrible than its own considerable weight. It seemed a dead thing, long ages dead.
The only movement was that of a river of mud that moved sluggishly along the bottom of the valley past the tower. A mile or so further on, the river ran

down a ravine and disappeared underground.
But as the evening darkened it became apparent that the tower was not entirely without life. There was a single dim red light guttering deep within it.
It was this scene that Richard was surprised to see from a small white doorway set in the side of the valley wall, a few hundred yards from the tower.
âDonât step out!â said Dirk, putting up an arm, âThe atmosphere is poisonous. Iâm not sure whatâs in it but it would certainly get your carpets nice and clean.â
Dirk was standing in the doorway watching the valley with deep mistrust. âWhere are we?â asked Richard.
âBermuda,â said Dirk. âItâs a bit complicated.â
âThank you,â said Richard and walked groggily back across the room.âExcuse me,â he said to Reg, who was busy fussing round Michael Wenton-Weakes, making sure that the scuba diving suit he was wearing fitted snuggly everywhere, that the mask was secure and that the regulator for the air supply was working properly.
âSorry, can I just get past?â said Richard. âThanks.â
He climbed back up the stairs, went back into Regâs bedroom, sat shakily on the edge of the bed and picked up the phone again.
âBermuda,â he said, âitâs a bit complicated.â
Downstairs, Reg finished smearing Vaseline on all the joins of the suit and the few pieces of exposed skin around the mask, and then announced that all was ready.
Dirk swung himself away from the door and stood aside with the utmost bad

grace.
âWell then,â he said, âbe off with you. Good riddance. I wash my hands of the whole affair. I suppose we will have to wait here for you to send back the empty, for what itâs worth.â He stalked round the sofa with an angry gesture. He didnât like this. He didnât like any of it. He particularly didnât like Reg knowing more about space\time than he did. It made him angry that he didnât know why he didnât like it.
âMy dear fellow,â said Reg in a conciliatory tone, âconsider what a very small effort it is for us to help the poor soul. Iâm sorry if it seems to you an anti- climax after all your extraordinary feats of deduction. I know you feel that a mere errand of mercy seems not enough for you, but you should be more charitable.â
âCharitable, ha!â said Dirk. âI pay my taxes, what more do you want?â
He threw himself on to the sofa, ran his hands through his hair and sulked.
The possessed figure of Michael shook hands with Reg and said a few words of thanks. Then he walked stiffly to the door, turned and bowed to them both.
Dirk flung his head round and glared at him, his eyes flashing behind their spectacles and his hair flying wildly. The ghost looked at Dirk, and foramomentshivered insidewith apprehension. A superstitious instinct suddenly made the ghost wave. He waved Michaelâs hand round in a circle, three times, and then said a single word.
âGoodbye,â he said.
With that he turned again, gripped the sides of the doorway and stepped resolutely out into the mud, and into the foul and poisonous wind.
He paused for a moment to be sure that his footing was solid, that he had his balance, and then without another look back he walked away from them, out of the reach of the slimy things with legs, towards his ship.

âNow, what on earth did that mean?â said Dirk, irritably mimicking the odd triple wave.
Richard came thundering down the stairs, threw open the door and plunged into the room, wild-eyed.
âRoss has been murdered!â he shouted.
âWho the hellâs Ross?â shouted Dirk back at him.
âWhatsisname Ross, for Godâs sake,â exclaimed Richard, âthe new editor of Fathom.â
âWhatâs Fathom?â shouted Dirk again.
âMichaelâs bloody magazine, Dirk! Remember? Gordon chucked Michael off the magazine and gave it to this Ross guy to fun instead. Michael hated him for that. Well, last night Michael went and bloody murdered him!â
He paused, panting. âAt least,â he said, âhe was murdered. And Michael was the only one with any reason to.â
He ran to the door, looked out at the retreating figure disappearing into the gloom, and spun round again.
âIs he coming back?â said Richard.
Dirk leapt to his feet and stood blinking for a moment.
âThatâs it...â he said, âthatâs why Michael was the perfect subject. Thatâs what I should have been looking for. The thing the ghost made him do in order to establish his hold, the thing he had to be fundamentally willing to do, the thing that would match the ghostâs own purpose. Oh my dear God. He thinks weâve supplanted them and thatâs what he wants to reverse.
âHe thinks this is their world not ours. This was where they were going to settle and build their blasted paradise. It matches every step of the way.

âYou see,â he said, turning on Reg, âwhat we have done? I would not be surprised to discover that the accident your poor tormented soul out there is trying to reverse is the very thing which started life on this planet!â
He turned his eyes suddenly from Reg, who was white and trembling, back to Richard.
âWhen did you hear this?â he said, puzzled.
âEr, just now,â said Richard, âon... on the phone. Upstairs.â âWhat?â
âIt was Susan, I donât know how -- said she had a message on her answering machine telling her about it. She said the message... was from -- she said it was from Gordon, but I think she was hysterical. Dirk, what the hell is happening? Where are we?â
âWe are four billion years in the past,â said Reg in a shaking voice, âplease donât ask me why it is that the phone works when we are anywhere in the Universe other than where itâs actually connected, thatâs a matter you will have to take up with British Telecom, but --ââDamn and blast British Telecom,â shouted Dirk, the words coming easily from force of habit. He ran to the door and peered again at the dim shadowy figure trudging through the mud towards the Salaxalan ship, completely beyond their reach.
âHow long,â said Dirk, quite calmly, âwould you guess that itâs going to take that fat self deluding bastard to reach his ship? Because that is how long we have.
âCome. Let us sit down. Let us think. We have two minutes in which to decide what we are going to do. After that, I very much suspect that the three of us, and everything we have ever known, including the coelacanth and the dodo, dear Professor, will cease ever to have existed.â
He sat heavily on the sofa, then stood up again and removed Michaelâs

discarded jacket from under him. As he did so, a book fell out of the pocket.
CHAPTER 35
âI think itâs an appalling act of desecration,â said Richard to Reg, as they sat hiding behind a hedge.
The night was full of summer smells from the cottage garden, and the occasional whiff of sea air which came in on the light breezes that were entertaining themselves on the coast of the Bristol Channel.
There was a bright moon playing over the sea off in the distance, and by its light it was also possible to see some distance over Exmoor stretching away to the south of them.
Reg sighed.
âYes, maybe,â he said, âbut Iâm afraid heâs right, you know, it must be done. It was the only sure way. All the instructions were clearly contained in the piece once you knew what you were looking for. It has to be suppressed. The ghost will always be around. In fact two of him now. That is, assuming this works. Poor devil. Still, I suppose he brought it on himself.â
Richard fretfully pulled up some blades of grass and twisted them between his fingers.
He held them up to the moonlight, turned them to different angles, and watched the way light played on them.
âSuch music,â he said. âIâm not religious, but if I were I would say it was like a glimpse into the mind of God. Perhaps it was and I ought to be religious. I have to keep reminding myself that they didnât create the music, they only created the instrument which could read the score. And the score was life itself. And itâs all up there.â

He glanced into the sky. Unconsciously he started to quote:
âCould I revive within me
Her symphony and song
To such a deep delight âtwould win me
That with music loud and long
I would build that dome in air,
That sunny dome! Those caves of ice!â
âHmmm,â said Reg to himself, âI wonder if he arrived early enough.ââWhat did you say?â
âOh, nothing. Just a thought.â
âGood God, he can talk, canât he?â Richard exclaimed suddenly. âHeâs been in there over an hour now. I wonder whatâs going on.â
He got up and looked over the hedge at the small farm cottage basking in the moonlight behind them. About an hour earlier Dirk had walked boldly up to the front door and rapped on it.
When the door had opened, somewhat reluctantly, and a slightly dazed face had looked out, Dirk had doffed his absurd hat and said in a loud voice, âMr Samuel Coleridge?
âI was just passing by, on my way from Porlock, you understand, and I was wondering if I might trouble you to vouchsafe me an interview? Itâs just for a little parish broadsheet I edit. Wonât take much of your time I promise, I know you must be busy, famous poet like you, but I do so admire your work, and...â

The rest was lost, because by that time Dirk had effected his entry and closed the door behind him.
âWould you excuse me a moment?â said Reg.
âWhat? Oh sure,â said Richard, âIâm just going to have a look and see whatâs happening.â
While Reg wandered off behind a tree Richard pushed open the little gate and was just about to make his way up the path when he heard the sound of voices approaching the front door from within.
He hurriedly darted back, as the front door started to open.
âWell, thank you very much indeed, Mr Coleridge,â said Dirk, as he emerged, fiddling with his hat and bowing, âyou have been most kind and generous with your time, and I do appreciate it very much, as Iâm sure will my readers. Iâm
sure it will work up into a very nice little article, a copy of which you may rest assured I will send you for you to peruse at your leisure. I will most certainly welcome your comments if you have any, any points of style, you know, hints, tips, things of that nature. Well, thank you again, so much, for your time, I do hope I havenât kept you from anything important --â
The door slammed violently behind him.
Dirk turned with another in a long succession of triumphant beams and hurried down the path to Richard.
âWell, thatâs put a stop to that,â he said, patting his hands together, âI think heâd made a start on writing it down, but he wonât remember another word, thatâs for certain. Whereâs the egregious Professor? Ah, there you are. Good heavens, Iâd no idea Iâd been that long. A most fascinating and entertaining fellow, our Mr Coleridge, or at least Iâm sure he would have been if Iâd given him the chance, but I was rather too busy being fascinating myself.
âOh, but I did do as you asked, Richard, I asked him at the end about the

albatross and he said what albatross? So I said, oh it wasnât important, the albatross did not signify. He said what albatross didnât signify, and I said never mind the albatross, it didnât matter, and he said it did matter -- someone comes to his house in the middle of the night raving about albatrosses, he wanted to know why. I said blast the bloody albatross and he said he had a good mind to and he wasnât certain that that didnât give him an idea for a poem he was working on. Much better, he said, than being hit by an asteroid, which he thought was stretching credulity a bit. And so I came away.
âNow. Having saved the entire human race from extinction I could do with a pizza. What say you to such a proposal?â
Richard didnât offer an opinion. He was staring instead with some puzzlement at Reg.
âSomething troubling you?â said Reg, taken aback.
âThatâs a good trick,â said Richard, âI could have sworn you didnât have a beard before you went behind the tree.â
âOh --â Reg fingered the luxuriant three-inch growth -- âyes,â he said, âjust carelessness,â he said, âcarelessness.â
âWhat have you been up to?â
âOh, just a few adjustments. A little surgery, you understand. Nothing drastic.â
A few minutes later as he ushered them into the extra door that a nearby cowshed had mysteriously acquired, he looked back up into the sky behind them, just in time to see a small light flare up and disappear.
âSorry, Richard,â he muttered, and followed them in.

CHAPTER 36
âThank you, no,â said Richard firmly, âmuch as I would love the opportunity to buy you a pizza and watch you eat it, Dirk, I want to go straight home. I have to see Susan. Is that possible, Reg? Just straight to my flat? Iâll come up to Cambridge next week and collect my car.â
âWe are already there,â said Reg, âsimply step out of the door, and you are home in your own flat. It is early on Friday evening and the weekend lies before you.â
âThanks. Er, look, Dirk, Iâll see you around, OK? Do I owe you something? I donât know.â
Dirk waved the matter aside airily. âYou will hear from my Miss Pearce in due course,â he said.
âFine, OK, well Iâll see you when Iâve had some rest. Itâs been, well, unexpected.â
He walked to the door and opened it. Stepping outside he found himself halfway up his own staircase, in the wall of which the door had materialised.
He was about to start up the stairs when he turned again as a thought struck him. He stepped back in, closing the door behind him.
âReg, could we make one tiny detour?â he said. âI think it would be a good move if I took Susan out for a meal tonight, only the place I have in mind you have to book in advance. Could you manage three weeks for me?â
âNothing could be easier,â said Reg, and made a subtle adjustment to the disposition of the beads on the abacus. âThere,â he said, âWe have travelled backwards in time three weeks. You know where the phone is.âRichard hurried up the internal staircase to Regâs bedroom and phoned LâEsprit dâEscalier. The maÃ®tre dâ was charmed and delighted to take his reservation, and looked forward to seeing him in three weeksâ time. Richard went back downstairs shaking his head in wonder.

âI need a weekend of solid reality,â he said. âWho was that just going out of the door?â
âThat,â said Dirk, âwas your sofa being delivered. The man asked if we minded him opening the door so they could manoeuvre it round and I said we would be delighted.â
It was only a few minutes later that Richard found himself hurrying up the stairs to Susanâs flat. As he arrived at her front door he was pleased, as he always was, to hear the deep tones of her cello coming faintly from within. He quietly let himself in and then as he walked to the door of her music room he suddenly froze in astonishment. The tune she was playing was one he had heard before. A little tripping tune, that slowed, then danced again but with more difficulty...
His face was so amazed that she stopped playing the instant she saw him.
âWhatâs wrong?â she said, alarmed.
âWhere did you get that music?â said Richard in a whisper.
She shrugged. âWell, from the music shop,â she said, puzzled. She wasnât being facetious, she simply didnât understand the question.
âWhat is it?â
âItâs from a cantata Iâm playing in in a couple of weeks,â she said, âBach, number six.â
âWho wrote it?â
âWell, Bach I expect. If you think about it.â
âWho?â
âWatch my lips. Bach. B-A-C-H. Johannes Sebastian. Remember?â

âNo, never heard of him. Who is he? Did he write anything else?â
Susan put down her bow, propped up her cello, stood up and came over to him. âAre you all right?â she said.
âEr, itâs rather hard to tell. Whatâs...â
He caught sight of a pile of music books sitting in a corner of the room with the same name on the top one. BACH. He threw himself at the pile and started to scrabble through it. Book after book -- J. S. BACH. Cello sonatas. Brandenburg Concertos. A Mass in B Minor.
He looked up at her in blank incomprehension. âIâve never seen any of this before,â he said.
âRichard my darling,â she said, putting her hand to his cheek, âwhat on earthâs the matter? Itâs just Bach sheet music.â
âBut donât you understand?â he said, shaking a handful of the stuff. âIâve never, ever seen any of this before!â
âWell,â she said with mock gravity, âperhaps if you didnât spend all your time playing with computer music...â
He looked at her with wild surprise, then slowly he sat back against the wall and began to laugh hysterically.
On Monday afternoon Richard phoned Reg.
âReg!â he said. âYour phone is working. Congratulations.â
âOh yes, my dear fellow,â said Reg, âhow delightful to hear from you. Yes. A very capable young man arrived and fixed the phone a little earlier. I donât think it will go wrong again now. Good news, donât you think?â

âVery good. You got back safely then.â
âOh yes, thank you. Oh, we had high excitement here when we returned from dropping you off. Remember the horse? Well he turned up again with his owner. Theyâd had some unfortunate encounter with the constabulary and wished to be taken home. Just as well. Dangerous sort of chap to have on the loose I think. So. How are you then?
âReg... The music --â
âAh, yes, I thought youâd be pleased. Took a bit of work, I can tell you. I saved only the tiniest tiniest scrap, of course, but even so I cheated. It was rather more than one man could actually do in a lifetime, but I donât suppose anybody will look at that too seriously.ââReg, canât we get some more of it?â
âWell, no. The ship has gone, and besides --â
âWe could go back in time --â
âNo, well, I told you. Theyâve fixed the phone so it wonât go wrong again.â
âSo?â
âWell, the time machine wonât work now. Burnt out. Dead as a dodo. I think thatâs it Iâm afraid. Probably just as well, though, donât you think?â
On Monday, Mrs Sauskind phoned Dirk Gentlyâs Holistic Detective Agency to complain about her bill.
âI donât understand what all this is about,â she said, âitâs complete nonsense. Whatâs the meaning of it?â
âMy dear Mrs Sauskind,â he said, âI can hardly tell you how much I have been looking forward to having this exact same conversation with you yet again. Where shall we begin today? Which particular item is it that you would like to discuss?â

âNone of them, thank you very much, Mr Gently. I do not know who you are or why you should think my cat is missing. Dear Roderick passed away in my arms two years ago and I have not wished to replace him.â
âAh, well Mrs Sauskind,â said Dirk, âwhat you probably fail to appreciate is that it is as a direct result of my efforts that -- If I might explain about the interconnectedness of all...â He stopped. It was pointless. He slowly dropped the telephone back on its cradle.
âMiss Pearce!â he called out, âKindly send out a revised bill would you to our dear Mrs Sauskind. The new bill reads âTo saving human race from total extinction -- no charge.ââ
He put on his hat and left for the day.

This time there would be no witnesses.
This time there was just the dead earth, a rumble of thunder, and the onset of that interminable light drizzle from the north-east by which so many of the worldâs most momentous events seem to be accompanied.
The storms of the day before, and of the day before that, and the floods of the previous week, had now abated. The skies still bulged with rain, but all that actually fell in the gathering evening gloom was a dreary kind of prickle.
Some wind whipped across the darkening plain, blundered through the low hills and gusted across a shallow valley where stood a structure, a kind of tower, alone in a nightmare of mud, and leaning.
It was a blackened stump of a tower. It stood like an extrusion of magma from one of the more pestilential pits of hell, and it leaned at a peculiar angle, as if oppressed by something altogether more terrible than its own considerable weight. It seemed a dead thing, long ages dead.
The only movement was that of a river of mud that moved sluggishly along the bottom of the valley past the tower. A mile or so further on, the river ran down a ravine and disappeared underground.
But as the evening darkened it became apparent that the tower was not entirely without life. There was a single dim red light guttering deep within it.
The light was only just visible -- except of course that there was no one to see, no witnesses, not this time, but it was nevertheless a light. Every few minutes it grew a little stronger and a little brighter and then faded slowly away almost to nothing. At the same time a low keening noise drifted out on the
wind, built up to a kind of wailing climax, and then it too faded, abjectly, away.
Time passed, and then another light appeared, a smaller, mobile light. It emerged at ground level and moved in a single bobbing circuit of the tower, pausing occasionally on its way around. Then it, and the shadowy figure that could just be discerned carrying it, disappeared inside once more.
An hour passed, and by the end of it the darkness was total. The world seemed dead, the night a blankness.
And then the glow appeared again near the towerâs peak, this time growing in power more purposefully. It quickly reached the peak of brightness it had previously attained, and then kept going, increasing, increasing. The keening sound that accompanied it rose in pitch and stridency until it became a wailing scream. The scream screamed on and on till it became a blinding noise and the light a deafening redness.
And then, abruptly, both ceased.
There was a millisecond of silent darkness.
An astonishing pale new light billowed and bulged from deep within the mud beneath the tower. The sky clenched, a mountain of mud convulsed, earth and sky bellowed at each other, there was a horrible pinkness, a sudden greenness, a lingering orangeness that stained the clouds, and then the light sank and the night at last was deeply, hideously dark. There was no further sound other than the soft tinkle of water.
But in the morning the sun rose with an unaccustomed sparkle on a day that was, or seemed to be, or at least would have seemed to be if there had been anybody there to whom it could seem to be anything at all, warmer, clearer and brighter -- an altogether livelier day than any yet known. A clear river ran through the shattered remains of the valley.
And time began seriously to pass.

CHAPTER 2
High on a rocky promontory sat an Electric Monk on a bored horse. From under its rough woven cowl the Monk gazed unblinkingly down into another valley, with which it was having a problem.
The day was hot, the sun stood in an empty hazy sky and beat down upon the grey rocks and the scrubby, parched grass. Nothing moved, not even the Monk. The horseâs tail moved a little, swishing slightly to try and move a little air, but that was all. Otherwise, nothing moved.The Electric Monk was a labour- saving device, like a dishwasher or a video recorder. Dishwashers washed tedious dishes for you, thus saving you the bother of washing them
yourself, video recorders watched tedious television for you, thus saving you the bother of looking at it yourself; Electric Monks believed things for you, thus saving you what was becoming an increasingly onerous task, that of believing all the things the world expected you to believe.
Unfortunately this Electric Monk had developed a fault, and had started to believe all kinds of things, more or less at random. It was even beginning to believe things theyâd have difficulty believing in Salt Lake City. It had never heard of Salt Lake City, of course. Nor had it ever heard of a quingigillion, which was roughly the number of miles between this valley and the Great Salt Lake of Utah.
The problem with the valley was this. The Monk currently believed that the valley and everything in the valley and around it, including the Monk itself and the Monkâs horse, was a uniform shade of pale pink. This made for a certain difficulty in distinguishing any one thing from any other thing, and therefore made doing anything or going anywhere impossible, or at least difficult and dangerous. Hence the immobility of the Monk and the boredom of the horse, which had had to put up with a lot of silly things in its time but was secretly of the opinion that this was one of the silliest.
How long did the Monk believe these things?
Well, as far as the Monk was concerned, forever. The faith which moves mountains, or at least believes them against all the available evidence to be

pink, was a solid and abiding faith, a great rock against which the world could hurl whatever it would, yet it would not be shaken. In practice, the horse knew, twenty-four hours was usually about its lot.
So what of this horse, then, that actually held opinions, and was sceptical about things? Unusual behaviour for a horse, wasnât it? An unusual horse perhaps?
No. Although it was certainly a handsome and well-built example of its species, it was none the less a perfectly ordinary horse, such as convergent evolution has produced in many of the places that life is to be found. They have always understood a great deal more than they let on. It is difficult to be sat on all day, every day, by some other creature, without forming an opinion about them.
On the other hand, it is perfectly possible to sit all day, every day, on top of another creature and not have the slightest thought about them whatsoever.
When the early models of these Monks were built, it was felt to be important that they be instantly recognisable as artificial objects. There must be no danger of their looking at all like real people. You wouldnât want your video recorder lounging around on the sofa all day while it was watching TV. You wouldnât want it picking its nose, drinking beer and sending out for pizzas.
So the Monks were built with an eye for originality of design and also for practical horse-riding ability. This was important. People, and indeed things, looked more sincere on a horse. So two legs were held to be both more suitable and cheaper than the more normal primes of seventeen, nineteen or twenty-three; the skin the Monks were given was pinkish-looking instead of purple, soft and smooth instead of crenellated. They were also restricted to just one mouth and nose, but were given instead an additional eye, making for a grand total of two. A strange-looking creature indeed. But truly excellent at believing the most preposterous things.
This Monk had first gone wrong when it was simply given too much to believe in one day. It was, by mistake, cross-connected to a video recorder that was watching eleven TV channels simultaneously, and this caused it to blow a

bank of illogic circuits. The video recorder only had to watch them, of course. It didnât have to believe them all as well. This is why instruction manuals are so important.
So after a hectic week of believing that war was peace, that good was bad, that the moon was made of blue cheese, and that God needed a lot of money sent to a certain box number, the Monk started to believe that thirty-five percent of all tables were hermaphrodites, and then broke down. The man from the Monk shop said that it needed a whole new motherboard, but then pointed out that the new improved Monk Plus models were twice as powerful, had an entirely new multi-tasking Negative Capability feature that allowed them to hold up to sixteen entirely different and contradictory ideas in memory simultaneously without generating any irritating system errors, were twice as fast and at least three times as glib, and you could have a whole new one for less than the cost of replacing the motherboard of the old model.
That was it. Done.
The faulty Monk was turned out into the desert where it could believe what it liked, including the idea that it had been hard done by. It was allowed to keep its horse, since horses were so cheap to make.
For a number of days and nights, which it variously believed to be three, forty-three, and five hundred and ninety-eight thousand seven hundred and three, it roamed the desert, putting its simple Electric trust in rocks, birds, clouds and a form of non-existent elephant-asparagus, until at last it fetched up here, on this high rock, overlooking a valley that was not, despite the deep fervour of the Monkâs belief, pink. Not even a little bit.
Time passed.
CHAPTER 3
Time passed.

Susan waited.
The more Susan waited, the more the doorbell didnât ring. Or the phone. She looked at her watch. She felt that now was about the time that she could legitimately begin to feel cross. She was cross already, of course, but that had been in her own time, so to speak. They were well and truly into his time now, and even allowing for traffic, mishaps, and general vagueness and dilatoriness, it was now well over half an hour past the time that he had insisted was the latest time they could possibly afford to leave, so sheâd better be ready.
She tried to worry that something terrible had happened to him, but didnât believe it for a moment. Nothing terrible ever happened to him, though she was beginning to think that it was time it damn well did. If nothing terrible happened to him soon maybe sheâd do it herself. Now there was an idea.
She threw herself crossly into the armchair and watched the news on television. The news made her cross. She flipped the remote control and watched something on another channel for a bit. She didnât know what it was, but it also made her cross. Perhaps she should phone. She was damned if she was going to phone. Perhaps if she phoned he would phone her at the same moment and not be able to get through.
She refused to admit that she had even thought that.
Damn him, where was he? Who cared where he was anyway? She didnât, that was for sure.
Three times in a row heâd done this. Three times in a row was enough. She angrily flipped channels one more time. There was a programme about computers and some interesting new developments in the field of things you could do with computers and music.
That was it. That was really it. She knew that she had told herself that that was it only seconds earlier, but this was now the final real ultimate it.

She jumped to her feet and went to the phone, gripping an angry Filofax. She flipped briskly through it and dialed a number.
âHello, Michael? Yes, itâs Susan. Susan Way. You said I should call you if I was free this evening and I said Iâd rather be dead in a ditch, remember? Well, I suddenly discover that I am free, absolutely, completely and utterly free, and there isnât a decent ditch for miles around. Make your move while youâve got your chance is my advice to you. Iâll be at the Tangiers Club in half an hour.â
She pulled on her shoes and coat, paused when she remembered that it was Thursday and that she should put a fresh, extra-long tape on the answering machine, and two minutes later was out of the front door. When at last the phone did ring the answering machine said sweetly that Susan Way could not come to the phone just at the moment, but that if the caller would like to leave a message, she would get back to them as soon as possible. Maybe.
CHAPTER 4
It was a chill November evening of the old-fashioned type.
The moon looked pale and wan, as if it shouldnât be up on a night like this. It roseunwillinglyand hung like an ill spectre. Silhouetted against it, dim and hazy through the dampness which rose from the unwholesome fens, stood the assorted towers and turrets of St Ceddâs, Cambridge, a ghostly profusion of buildings thrown up over centuries, medieval next to Victorian, Odeon next to Tudor. Only rising through the mist did they seem remotely to belong to one another.
Between them scurried figures, hurrying from one dim pool of light toanother, shivering, leavingwraiths ofbreath which folded themselves into the cold night behind them.
It was seven oâclock. Many of the figures were heading for the college

dining hall which divided First Court from Second Court, and from which warm light, reluctantly, streamed. Two figures in particular seemed ill-matched. One, a young man, was tall, thin and angular; even muffled inside a heavy dark coat he walked a little like an affronted heron.
The other was small,roundish,andmoved with an ungainly restlessness, like a number of elderly squirrels trying to escape from a sack. His own age was on the older side of completely indeterminate. If you picked a number at random, he was probably a little older than that, but -- well, it was impossible to tell. Certainly his face was heavily lined, and the small amount of hair that escaped from under his red woollen skiing hat was thin, white, and had very much its own ideas about how it wished to arrange itself. He too was muffled inside a heavy coat, but over it he wore a billowing gown with very faded purple trim, the badge of his unique and peculiar academic office.
As they walked the older man was doing all the talking. He was pointing at items of interest along the way, despite the fact that it was too dark to see any of them. The younger man was saying âAh yes,â and âReally? How interesting...â and âWell, well, well,â and âGood heavens.â His head bobbed seriously.
They entered, not through the main entrance to the hall, but through a small doorway on the east side of the court. This led to the Senior Combination Room and a dark-panelled anteroom where the Fellows of the college assembled to slap their hands and make âbrrrrrrâ noises before making their way through their own entrance to the High Table.
They were late and shook off their coats hurriedly. This was complicated for the older man by the necessity first of taking off his professorial gown, and then of putting it back on again once his coat was off, then of stuffing his hat in his coat pocket, then of wondering where heâd put his scarf, and then of realising that he hadnât brought it, then of fishing in his coat pocket for his handkerchief, then of fishing in his other coat pocket for his spectacles, and finally of finding them quite unexpectedly wrapped in his scarf, which it
turned out he had brought after all but hadnât been wearing despite the damp and bitter wind blowing in like a witchâs breath from across the fens.He bustled the younger man into the hall ahead of him and they took the last two vacant

seats at the High Table, braving a flurry of frowns and raised eyebrows for interrupting the Latin grace to do so.
Hall was full tonight. It was always more popularwith the undergraduates in the colder months. More unusually, the hall was candlelit, as it was now only on very few special occasions. Two long, crowded tables stretchedoffinto the glimmering darkness.By candlelight, peopleâs faces were more alive, the hushed sounds of their voices, the clink of cutlery and glasses, seemed more exciting, and in the dark recesses of the great hall, all the centuries for which it had existed seemed present at once. High Table itself formed a crosspiece at the top, and was raised about a foot above the rest. Since it was a guest night, the table was set on both sides to accommodate the extra numbers, and many diners therefore sat with their backs to the rest of the hall.
âSo, young MacDuff,â said the Professor once he was seated and flapping his napkin open, âpleasure to see you again, my dear fellow. Glad you could come. No idea what all this is about,â he added, peering round the hall in consternation. âAll the candles and silver and business. Generally means a special dinner in honour of someone or something no one can remember anything about except that it means better food for a night.â
He paused and thought for a moment, and then said, âIt seems odd, donât you think, that the quality of the food should vary inversely with the brightness of the lighting. Makes you wonder what culinary heights the kitchen staff could rise to if you confined them to perpetual darkness. Could be worth a try, I think. Got some good vaults in the college that could be turned over to the purpose. I think I showed you round them once, hmmm? Nice brickwork.â
All this came as something of a relief to his guest. It was the first indication his host hadgiven that he had thefaintest recollectionwhohe was. Professor Urban Chronotis, the Regius Professor of Chronology, or âRegâ as he insisted on being called had a memory that he himself had once compared to the Queen Alexandra Birdwing Butterfly, in that it was colourful, flitted prettily hither and thither, and was now, alas, almost completely extinct.
When he had telephoned with the invitation a few days previously, he had seemed extremely keen to see his former pupil, and yet when Richard had

arrived this evening, a little on the late side, admittedly, the Professor had thrown open the door apparently in anger, had started in surprise on seeing Richard, demanded to know if he was having emotional problems, reacted in annoyance to being reminded gently that it was now ten years since he had been Richardâs college tutor, and finally agreed that Richard had indeed come for dinner, whereupon he, the Professor, had started talking rapidly and at length about the history of the college architecture, a sure sign that his mind was elsewhere entirely.âRegâ had never actually taught Richard, he had only been his college tutor, which meant in short that he had had charge of his general welfare, told him when the exams were and not to take drugs, and so on. Indeed, it was not entirely clear if Reg had ever taught anybody at all and what, if anything, he would have taught them. His professorship was an obscure one, to say the least, and since he dispensed with his lecturing duties by the simple and time-honoured technique of presenting all his potential students with an exhaustive list of books that he knew for a fact had been out of print for thirty years, then flying into a tantrum if they failed to find them, no one had ever discovered the precise nature of his academic
discipline. He had, of course, long ago taken the precaution of removing the only extant copies of the books on his reading list from the university and college libraries, as a result of which he had plenty of time to, well, to do whatever it was he did.
Since Richard had always managed to get on reasonably well with the old fruitcake, he had one day plucked up courage to ask him what, exactly, the Regius Professorship of Chronology was. It had been one of those light summery days when the world seems about to burst with pleasure at simply being itself, and Reg had been in an uncharacteristically forthcoming mood as they had walked over the bridge where the River Cam divided the older parts of the college from the newer.
âSinecure, my dear fellow, an absolute sinecure,â he had beamed. âA small amount of money for a very small, or shall we say non-existent, amount of work. That puts me permanently just ahead of the game, which is a comfortable if frugal place to spend your life. I recommend it.â He leaned over the edge of the bridge and started to point out a particular brick that he found interesting. âBut what sort of study is it supposed to be?â Richard had pursued. âIs it history? Physics? Philosophy? What?â

âWell,â said Reg, slowly, âsince youâre interested, the chair was originally instituted by King George III, who, as you know, entertained a number of amusing notions, including the belief that one of the trees in Windsor Great Park was in fact Frederick the Great.
âIt was his own appointment, hence âRegiusâ. His own idea as well, which is somewhat more unusual.â
Sunlight played along the River Cam. People in punts happily shouted at each other to fuck off. Thin natural scientists who had spent months locked away in their rooms growing white and fishlike, emerged blinking into the light. Couples walking along the bank got so excited about the general wonderfulness of it all that they had to pop inside for an hour.
âThe poor beleaguered fellow,â Reg continued, âGeorge III, I mean, was, as you may know, obsessed with time. Filled the palace with clocks. Wound them incessantly. Sometimes would get up in the middle of the night and prowl round the palace in his nightshirt winding clocks. He was very concerned that time continued to go forward, you see. So many terrible things had occurred in his life that he was terrified that any of them might happen again if time were ever allowed to slip backwards even for a moment. A very understandable fear, especially if youâre barking mad, as Iâm afraid to say, with the very greatest sympathy for the poor fellow, he undoubtedly was. He appointed me, or rather I should say, my office, this professorship, you understand, the post that I am now privileged to hold to -- where was I? Oh yes. He instituted this, er, Chair of Chronology to see if there was any particular reason why one thing happened after another and if there was any way of stopping it. Since the answers to the three questions were, I knew immediately, yes, no, and maybe, I realised I could then take the rest of my career off.â
âAnd your predecessors?â
âEr, were much of the same mind.â âBut who were they?â

âWho were they? Well, splendid fellows of course, splendid to a man. Remind me to tell you about them some day. See that brick? Wordsworth was once sick on that brick. Great man.â
All that had been about ten years ago.
Richard glanced around the great dining hall to see what had changed in the time, and the answer was, of course, absolutely nothing. In the dark heights, dimly seen by the flickering candlelight, were the ghostly portraits of prime ministers, archbishops, political reformers and poets, any of whom might, in their day, have been sick on that same brick.
âWell,âsaidReg, in a loudly confidential whisper, asif introducing the subject of nipple-piercing in a nunnery, âI hear youâve suddenly done very well for yourself, at last, hmmm?â
âEr, well, yes, in fact,â said Richard, who was as surprised at the fact as anybody else, âyes, I have.â
Around the table several gazes stiffened on him.
âComputers,â he heard somebody whisper dismissively to a neighbour further down the table. The stiff gazes relaxed again, and turned away.âExcellent,â said Reg. âIâm so pleased for you, so pleased.â
âTell me,â he went on, and it was a moment before Richard realised that the Professor wasnât talking to him any more, but had turned to the right to address his other neighbour, âwhatâs all this about, this,â he flourished a vague hand over the candles and college silver, â...stuff?â
His neighbour, an elderly wizened figure, turned very slowly and looked at him as if he was rather annoyed at being raised from the dead like this.
âColeridge,â he said in a thin rasp, âitâs the Coleridge Dinner you old fool.â He turned very slowly back until he was facing the front again. His name was Cawley, he was a Professor of Archaeology and Anthropology, and it was

frequently said of him, behind his back, that he regarded it not so much as a serious academic study, more as a chance to relive his childhood.
âAh, is it,â murmured Reg, âis it?â and turned back to Richard. âItâs the Coleridge Dinner,â he said knowledgeably. âColeridge was a member of the college, you know,â he added after a moment. âColeridge. Samuel Taylor. Poet. I expect youâve heard of him. This is his Dinner. Well, not literally, of course. It would be cold by now.â Silence. âHere, have some salt.â
âEr, thank you, I think Iâll wait,â said Richard, surprised. There was no food on the table yet.
âGo on, take it,â insisted the Professor, proffering him the heavy silver salt cellar.
Richard blinked in bemusement but with an interior shrug he reached to take it. In the moment that he blinked, however, the salt cellar had completely vanished.
He started back in surprise.
âGood one, eh?â said Reg as he retrieved the missing cruet from behind the ear of his deathly right-hand neighbour, provoking a surprisingly girlish giggle from somewhere else at the table. Reg smiled impishly. âVery irritating habit, I know. Itâs next on my list for giving up after smoking and leeches.â
Well, that was another thing that hadnât changed. Some people pick their noses, others habitually beat up old ladies on the streets. Regâs vice was a harmless if peculiar one -- an addiction to childish conjuring tricks. Richard remembered the first time he had been to see Reg with a problem -- it was only the normal Angst that periodically takes undergraduates into its grip, particularly when they have essays to write, but it had seemed a dark and savage weight at the time. Reg had sat and listened to his outpourings with adeep frown of concentration, and when at last Richard had finished, he pondered seriously, stroked his chin a lot, and at last leaned forward and looked him in the eye.

âI suspect that your problem,â he said, âis that you have too many paper clips up your nose.â
Richard stared at him.
âAllow me to demonstrate,â said Reg, and leaning across the desk he pulled from Richardâs nose a chain of eleven paper clips and a small rubber swan.
âAh, the real culprit,â he said, holding up the swan. âThey come in cereal packets, you know, and cause no end of trouble. Well, Iâm glad weâve had this little chat, my dear fellow. Please feel free to disturb me again if you have any more such problems.â
Needless to say, Richard didnât.
Richard glanced around the table to see if there was anybody else he recognised from his time at the college.
Two places away to the left was the don who had been Richardâs Director of Studies in English, who showed no signs of recognising him at all. This was hardly surprising since Richard had spent his three years here assiduously avoiding him, often to the extent of growing a beard and pretending to be someone else.
Next to him was a man whom Richard had never managed to identify. Neither, in fact, had anyone else. He was thin and vole-like and had the most extraordinarily long bony nose -- it really was very, very long and bony indeed. In fact it looked a lot like the controversial keel which had helped the Australians win the Americaâs Cup in 1983, and this resemblance had been much remarked upon at the time, though not of course to his face. No one had said anything to his face at all.No one.
Ever.
Anyone meeting him forthe first time was too startled and embarrassed by his nose to speak, and the second time was worse because of the first time, and

so on. Years had gone by now, seventeen in all. In all that time he had been cocooned in silence. In hall it had long been the habit of the college servants to position a separate set of salt, pepper and mustard on either side of him, since no one could ask him to pass them, and to ask someone sitting on the other side of him was not only rude but completely impossible because of his nose being in the way.
The other odd thing about him was a series of gestures he made and repeated regularly throughout every evening. They consisted of tapping each of the fingers of his left hand in order, and then one of the fingers of his right hand. He would then occasionally tap some other part of his body, a knuckle, an elbow or a knee. Whenever he was forced to stop this by the requirements of eating he would start blinking each of his eyes instead, and occasionally nodding. No one, of course, had ever dared to ask him why he did this, though all were consumed with curiosity.
Richard couldnât see who was sitting beyond him.
In the other direction, beyond Regâs deathly neighbour, was Watkin, the Classics Professor, a man of terrifying dryness and oddity. His heavy rimless glasses were almost solid cubes of glass within which his eyes appeared to lead independent existences like goldfish. His nose was straight enough and ordinary, but beneath it he wore the same beard as Clint Eastwood. His eyes gazed swimmingly around the table as he selected who was going to be spoken at tonight. He had thought that his prey might be one of the guests, the newly appointed Head of Radio Three, who was sitting opposite -- but unfortunately he had already been ensnared by the Music Director of the college and a Professor of Philosophy. These two were busy explaining to the harassed man that the phrase âtoo much Mozartâ was, given any reasonable definition of those three words, an inherently self-contradictory expression, and that any sentence which contained such a phrase would be thereby rendered meaningless and could not, consequently, be advanced as part of an argument in favour of any given programme-scheduling strategy. The poor man was already beginning to grip his cutlery too tightly. His eyes darted about desperately looking for rescue, and made the mistake of lighting on those of Watkin.

âGood evening,â said Watkin with smiling charm, nodding in the most friendly way, and then letting his gaze settle glassily on to his bowl of newly arrived soup, from which position it would not allow itself to be moved. Yet. Let the bugger suffer a little. He wanted the rescue to be worth at least a good half dozen radio talk fees.
Beyond Watkin, Richard suddenly discovered the source of the little girlish giggle that had greeted Regâs conjuring trick. Astonishingly enough it was a little girl. She was about eight years old with blonde hair and a glum look. She was sitting occasionally kicking pettishly at the table leg.
âWhoâs that?â Richard asked Reg in surprise. âWhoâs what?â Reg asked Richard in surprise.
Richard inclined a finger surreptitiously in her direction. âThe girl,â he whispered, âthe very, very little girl. Is it some new maths professor?â
Reg peered round at her. âDo you know,â he said in astonishment, âI havenâtthe faintest idea. Neverknown anythinglike it. How extraordinary.â
At that moment the problem was solved by the man from the BBC, who suddenly wrenched himself out of the logical half-nelson into which his neighbours had got him, and told the girl off for kicking the table. She stopped kicking the table, and instead kicked the air with redoubled vigour. He told her to try and enjoy herself, so she kicked him. This did something to bring a brief glimmer of pleasure into her glum evening, but it didnât last. Her father briefly shared with the table at large his feelings about baby-sitters who let people down, but nobody felt able to run with the topic.
âA major season of Buxtehude,â resumed the Director of Music, âis of course clearly long overdue. Iâm sure youâll be looking forward to remedying this situation at the first opportunity.â
âOh, er, yes,â replied the girlâs father, spilling his soup, âer, that is... heâs not the same one as Gluck, is he?â

The little girl kicked the table leg again. When her father looked sternly at her, she put her head on one side and mouthed a question at him.
âNot now,â he insisted at her as quietly as he could.
âWhen, then?â
âLater. Maybe. Later, weâll see.â
She hunched grumpily back in her seat. âYou always say later,â she mouthed at him.
âPoor child,â murmured Reg. âThere isnât a don at this table who doesnât behave exactly like that inside. Ah, thank you.â Their soup arrived, distracting his attention, and Richardâs.
âSo tell me,â said Reg, after they had both had a couple of spoonsful and arrived independently at the same conclusion, that it was not a taste explosion, âwhat youâve been up to, my dear chap. Something to do with computers, I understand, and also to do with music. I thought you read English when you were here -- though only, I realise, in your spare time.â He looked at Richard significantly over the rim of his soup spoon. âNow wait,â he interrupted before Richard even had a chance to start, âdonât I vaguely remember that you had some sort of computer when you were here? When was it? 1977?â
âWell, what we called a computer in 1977 was really a kind of electric abacus, but...â
âOh, now, donât underestimate the abacus,â said Reg. âIn skilled hands itâs a very sophisticated calculating device. Furthermore it requires no power, can be made with any materials you have to hand, and never goes bing in the middle of an important piece of work.â
âSo an electric one would be particularly pointless,â said Richard.âTrue enough,â conceded Reg.
âThere really wasnât a lot this machine could do that you couldnât do yourself

in half the time with a lot less trouble,â said Richard, âbut it was, on the other hand, very good at being a slow and dim-witted pupil.â
Reg looked at him quizzically.
âI had no idea they were supposed to be in short supply,â he said. âI could hit a dozen with a bread roll from where Iâm sitting.â
âIâm sure. But look at it this way. What really is the point of trying to teach anything to anybody?â
This question seemed to provoke a murmur of sympathetic approval from up and down the table.
Richard continued, âWhat I mean is that if you really want to understand something, the best way is to try and explain it to someone else. That forces you to sort it out in your own mind. And the more slow and dim-witted your pupil, the more you have to break things down into more and more simple ideas. And thatâs really the essence of programming. By the time youâve sorted out a complicated idea into little steps that even a stupid machine can deal with, youâve certainly learned something about it yourself. The teacher usually learns more than the pupil. Isnât that true?â
âIt would be hard to learn much less than my pupils,â came a low growl from somewhere on the table, âwithout undergoing a pre-frontal lobotomy.â
âSo I used to spend days struggling to write essays on this 16K machine that would have taken a couple of hours on a typewriter, but what was fascinating to me was the process of trying to explain to the machine what it was I wanted it to do. I virtually wrote my own word processor in BASIC. A simple search and replace routine would take about three hours.â
âI forget, did you ever get any essays done at all?â
âWell, not as such. No actual essays, but the reasons why not were absolutely fascinating. For instance, I discovered that...â

He broke off, laughing at himself.
âI was also playing keyboards in a rock group, of course,â he added. âThat didnât help.â
âNow, that I didnât know,â said Reg. âYour past has murkier things in it than I dreamed possible. A quality, I might add, that it shares with this soup.â He wiped his mouth with his napkin very carefully. âI must go and have a word with the kitchen staff one day. I would like to be sure that they are keeping the right bits and throwing the proper bits away. So. A rock group, you say. Well, well, well. Good heavens.ââYes,â said Richard. âWe called ourselves The Reasonably Good Band, but in fact we werenât. Our intention was to be the Beatles of the early eighties, but we got much better financial and legal advice than the Beatles ever did, which was basically âDonât botherâ, so we didnât. I left Cambridge and starved for three years.â
âBut didnât I bump into you during that period,â said Reg, âand you said you were doing very well?â
âAs a road sweeper, yes. There was an awful lot of mess on the roads. More than enough, I felt, to support an entire career. However, I got the sack for sweeping the mess on to another sweeperâs patch.â
Reg shook his head. âThe wrong career for you, Iâm sure. There are plentyofvocations wheresuchbehaviour would ensurerapid preferment.â
âI tried a few -- none of them much grander, though. And I kept none of them very long, because I was always too tired to do them properly. Iâd be found asleep slumped over the chicken sheds or filing cabinets - - depending on what the job was. Been up all night with the computer you see, teaching it to play âThree Blind Miceâ. It was an important goal for me.â
âIâm sure,â agreed Reg. âThank you,â he said to the college servant who took his half-finished plate of soup from him, âthank you very much. âThree Blind Miceâ, eh? Good. Good. So no doubt you succeeded eventually, and this accounts for your present celebrated status. Yes?ââWell, thereâs a bit more to it than that.â

âI feared there might be. Pity you didnât bring it with you though. It might have cheered up the poor young lady who is currently having our dull and crusty company forced upon her. A swift burst of âThree Blind Miceâ would probably do much to revive her spirits.â He leaned forward to look past his two right-hand neighbours at the girl, who was still sitting sagging in her chair.
âHello,â he said.
She looked up in surprise, and then dropped her eyes shyly, swinging her legs again.
âWhich do you think is worse,â enquired Reg, âthe soup or the company?â She gave a tiny, reluctant laugh and shrugged, still looking down.
âI think youâre wise not to commit yourself at this stage,â continued Reg. âMyself, Iâm waiting to see the carrots before I make any judgements. Theyâve been boiling them since the weekend, but I fear it may not be enough. The only thing that could possibly be worse than the carrots is Watkin. Heâs the man with the silly glasses sitting between us. My nameâs Reg, by the way. Come over and kick me when you have a moment.â The girl giggled and glanced up at Watkin, who stiffened and made an appallingly unsuccessful attempt to smile good-naturedly.
âWell, little girl,â he said to her awkwardly, and she had desperately to suppress a hoot of laughter at his glasses. Little conversation therefore ensued, but the girl had an ally, and began to enjoy herself a tiny little bit. Her father gave her a relieved smile.Reg turned back to Richard, who said, suddenly, âDo you have any family?â
âEr... no,â said Reg, quietly. âBut tell me. After âThree Blind Miceâ, what then?â
âWell, to cut a long story short, Reg, I ended up working for WayForward Technologies...â

âAh, yes, the famous Mr Way. Tell me, whatâs he like?â
Richard was always faintly annoyed by this question, probably because he was asked it so often.
âBoth better and worse than heâs represented in the press. I like him a lot, actually. Like any driven man he can be a bit trying at times, but Iâve known him since the very early days of the company when neither he nor I had a bean to our names. Heâs fine. Itâs just that itâs a good idea not to let him have your phone number unless you possess an industrial-grade answering machine.ââWhat? Whyâs that?â
âWell, heâs one of those people who can only think when heâs talking. When he has ideas, he has to talk them out to whoever will listen. Or, if the people themselves are not available, which is increasingly the case, their answering machines will do just as well. He just phones them up and talks at them. He has one secretary whose sole job is to collect tapes from people he might have phoned, transcribe them, sort them and give him the edited text the next day in a blue folder.â
âA blue one, eh?â
âAsk me why he doesnât simply use a tape recorder,â said Richard with a shrug.
Reg considered this. âI expect he doesnât use a tape recorder because he doesnât like talking to himself,â he said. âThere is a logic there. Of a kind.â
He took a mouthful of his newly arrived porc au poivre and ruminated on it for a while before gently laying his knife and fork aside again for the moment.
âSo what,â he said at last, âis the role of young MacDuff in all this?â
âWell, Gordon assigned me to write a major piece of software for the Apple Macintosh. Financial spreadsheet, accounting, that sort of thing, powerful, easy to use, lots of graphics. I asked him exactly what he wanted in it, and he just

said, âEverything. I want the top piece of all-singing, all-dancing business software for that machine.â And being of a slightly whimsical turn of mind I took him literally.
âYou see, a pattern of numbers can represent anything you like, can be used to map any surface, or modulate any dynamic process -- and so on. And any set of company accounts are, in the end, just a pattern of numbers. So I sat down and wrote a program thatâll take those numbers and do what you like with them. If you just want a bar graph itâll do them as a bar graph, if you want them as a pie chart or scatter graph itâll do them as a pie chart or scatter graph. If you want dancing girls jumping out of the pie chart in order to distract attention from the figures the pie chart actually represents, then the program will do that as well. Or you can turn your figures into, for instance, a flock of seagulls, and the formation they fly in and the way in which the wings of each gull beat will be determined by the performance of each division of your company. Great for producing animated corporate logos that actually mean something.
âBut the silliest feature of all was that if you wanted your company accounts represented as a piece of music, it could do that as well. Well, I thought it was silly. The corporate world went bananas over it.â
Reg regarded him solemnly from over a piece of carrot poised delicately on his fork in front of him, but did not interrupt.
âYou see, any aspect of a piece of music can be expressed as a sequence or pattern of numbers,â enthused Richard. âNumbers can express the pitch of notes, the length of notes, patterns of pitches and lengths.â
âYou mean tunes,â said Reg. The carrot had not moved yet. Richard grinned.
âTunes would be a very good word for it. I must remember that.â
âIt would help you speak more easily.â Reg returned the carrot to his plate, untasted. âAnd this software did well, then?â he asked.

âNot so much here. The yearly accounts of most British companies emerged sounding like the Dead March from Saul, but in Japan they went for it like a pack of rats. It produced lots of cheery company anthems that started well,
but if you were going to criticise youâd probably say that they tended to get a bit loud and squeaky at the end. Did spectacular business in the States, which was the main thing, commercially. Though the thing thatâs interesting me most now is what happens if you leave the accounts out of it. Turn the numbers that represent the way a swallowâs wings beat directly into music. What would you hear? Not the sound of cash registers, according to Gordon.ââFascinating,â said Reg, âquite fascinating,â and popped the carrot at last into his mouth. He turned and leaned forward to speak to his new girlfriend.
âWatkin loses,â he pronounced. âThe carrots have achieved a new all-time low. Sorry, Watkin, but awful as you are, the carrots, Iâm afraid, are world-beaters.â
The girl giggled more easily than last time and she smiled at him. Watkin was trying to take all this good-naturedly, but it was clear as his eyes swam at Reg that he was more used to discomfiting than being discomfited.
âPlease,Daddy, can I now?âWith her new-found, if slight, confidence, the girl had also found a voice.
âLater,â insisted her father.
âThis is already later. Iâve been timing it.â
âWell...â He hesitated, and was lost.
âWeâve been to Greece,â announced the girl in a small but awed voice.
âAh, have you indeed,â said Watkin, with a little nod. âWell, well. Anywhere in particular, or just Greece generally?â
âPatmos,â she said decisively. âIt was beautiful. I think Patmos is the most beautiful place in the whole world. Except the ferry never came when it said

it would. Never, ever. I timed it. We missed our flight but I didnât mind.â
âAh, Patmos, I see,â said Watkin, who was clearly roused by the news. âWell, what you have to understand, young lady, is that the Greeks, not content with dominating the culture of the Classical world, are also responsible for the greatest, some would say the only, work of true creative imagination produced this century as well. I refer of course to the Greek ferry timetables. A work of the sublimest fiction. Anyone who has travelled in the Aegean will confirm this. Hmm, yes. I think so.â
She frowned at him.
âI found a pot,â she said.
âProbably nothing,â interrupted her father hastily. âYou know the way it is. Everyone who goes to Greece for the first time thinks theyâve found a pot, donât they? Ha, ha.â
There were general nods. This was true. Irritating, but true.
âI found it in the harbour,â she said, âin the water. While we were waiting for the damn ferry.â
âSarah! Iâve told you...â
âItâs just what you called it. And worse. You called it words I didnât think you knew. Anyway, I thought that if everyone here was meant to be so clever, then someone would be able to tell me if it was a proper ancient Greek thing or not. I think itâs very old. Will you please let them see it, Daddy?â
Her father shrugged hopelessly and started to fish about under his chair.
âDid you know, young lady,â said Watkin to her, âthat the Book of Revelation was written on Patmos? It was indeed. By Saint John the Divine, as you know. To me it shows very clear signs of having been written while waiting for a ferry. Oh, yes, I think so. It starts off, doesnât it, with that kind of dreaminess you get when youâre killing time, getting bored, you know, just

making things up, and then gradually grows to a sort of climax of hallucinatory despair. I find that very suggestive. Perhaps you should write a paper on it.â He nodded at her.
She looked at him as if he were mad.
âWell, here it is,â said her father, plonking the thing down on the table. âJust a pot, as you see. Sheâs only six,â he added with a grim smile, âarenât you, dear?â
âSeven,â said Sarah.
The pot was quite small, about five inches high and four inches across at its widest point. The body was almost spherical, with a very narrow neck extending about an inch above the body. The neck and about half of the surface area were encrusted with hard-caked earth, but the parts of the pot that could be seen were of a rough, ruddy texture.
Sarah took it and thrust it into the hands of the don sitting on her right. âYou look clever,â she said. âTell me what you think.â
The don took it, and turned it over with a slightly supercilious air. âIâm sure if you scraped away the mud from the bottom,â he remarked wittily, âit would probably say âMade in Birminghamâ.â
âThat old, eh?â said Sarahâs father with a forced laugh. âLong time since anything was made there.â
âAnyway,â said the don, ânot my field, Iâm a molecular biologist. Anyone else want to have a look?â
This question was not greeted with wild yelps of enthusiasm, but nevertheless the pot was passed from hand to hand around the far end of the table in a desultory fashion. It was goggled at through pebble glasses, peered at through horn-rims, gazed at over half-moons, and squinted at by someone who had left his glasses in his other suit, which he very much feared had now gone to the cleanerâs. No one seemed to know how old it was, or to care very

much. The young girlâs face began to grow downhearted again.
âSour lot,â said Reg to Richard. He picked up a silver salt cellar again and held it up.
âYoung lady,â he said, leaning forward to address her.
âOh, not again, you old fool,â muttered the aged archaeologist Cawley, sitting back and putting his hands over his ears.
âYoung lady,â repeated Reg, âregard this simple silver salt cellar. Regard this simple hat.â
âYou havenât got a hat,â said the girl sulkily.
âOh,â said Reg, âa moment please,â and he went and fetched his woolly red one.
âRegard,â he said again, âthis simple silver salt cellar. Regard this simple woolly hat. I put the salt cellar in the hat, thus, and I pass the hat to you. The next part of the trick, dear lady... is up to you.â
He handed the hat to her, past their two intervening neighbours, Cawley and Watkin. She took the hat and looked inside it.
âWhereâs it gone?â she asked, staring into the hat.
âItâs wherever you put it,â said Reg.
âOh,â said Sarah, âI see. Well... that wasnât very good.â
Reg shrugged. âA humble trick, but it gives me pleasure,â he said, and turned back to Richard. âNow, what were we talking about?â
Richard looked at him with a slight sense of shock. He knew that the Professor had always been prone to sudden and erratic mood swings, but it was as if all the warmth had drained out of him in an instant. He now wore the same

distracted expression Richard had seen on his face when first he had arrived at his door that evening, apparently completely unexpected. Reg seemed then to sense that Richard was taken aback and quickly reassembled a smile.
âMy dear chap!â he said. âMy dear chap! My dear, dear chap! What was I saying?â
âEr, you were saying âMy dear chapâ.â
âYes, but I feel sure it was a prelude to something. A sort of short toccata on the theme of what a splendid fellow you are prior to introducing the main subject of my discourse, the nature of which I currently forget. You have no idea what I was about to say?â
âNo.â
âOh. Well, I suppose I should be pleased. If everyone knew exactly what I was going to say, then there would be no point in my saying it, would there? Now, howâs our young guestâs pot doing?â
In fact it had reached Watkin, who pronounced himself no expert on what the ancients had made for themselves to drink out of, only on what they had written as a result. He said that Cawley was the one to whose knowledge and experience they should all bow, and attempted to give the pot to him.
âI said,â he repeated, âyours was the knowledge and experience to which we should bow. Oh, for heavenâs sake, take your hands off your ears and have a look at the thing.â
Gently, but firmly, he drew Cawleyâs right hand from his ear, explained the situation to him once again, and handed him the pot. Cawley gave it a cursory but clearly expert examination.
âYes,â he said, âabout two hundred years old, I would think. Very rough. Very crude example of its type. Utterly without value, of course.â
He put it down peremptorily and gazed off into the old minstrel gallery,

which appeared to anger him for some reason.
The effect on Sarah was immediate. Already discouraged, she was thoroughly downcast by this. She bit her lip and threw herself back against her chair, feeling once again thoroughly out of place and childish. Her father gave her a warning look about misbehaving, and then apologised for her again.
âWell, Buxtehude,â he hurried on to say, âyes, good old Buxtehude. Weâll have to see what we can do. Tell me...â
âYoung lady,â interrupted a voice, hoarse with astonishment, âyou are clearly a magician and enchantress of prodigious powers!â
All eyes turned to Reg, the old show-off. He was gripping the pot and staring at it with manic fascination. He turned his eyes slowly to the little girl, as if for the first time assessing the power of a feared adversary.
âI bow to you,â he whispered. âI, unworthy though I am to speak in the presence of such a power as yours, beg leave to congratulate you on one of the finest feats of the conjurerâs art it has been my privilege to witness!â
Sarah stared at him with widening eyes.
âMay I show these people what you have wrought?â he asked earnestly.Very faintly she nodded, and he fetched her formerly precious, but now sadly discredited, pot a sharp rap on the table.
It split into two irregular parts, the caked clay with which it was surrounded falling in jagged shards on the table. One side of the pot fell away, leaving the rest standing.
Sarahâs eyes goggled at the stained and tarnished but clearly recognisable silver college salt cellar, standing jammed in the remains of the pot.
âStupid old fool,â muttered Cawley.

After the general disparagement and condemnation of this cheap parlour trick had died down -- none of which could dim the awe in Sarahâs eyes -- Reg turned to Richard and said, idly:
âWho was that friend of yours when you were here, do you ever see him? Chap with an odd East European name. Svlad something. Svlad Cjelli. Remember the fellow?â
Richard looked at him blankly for a moment.
âSvlad?â he said. âOh, you mean Dirk. Dirk Cjelli. No. I never stayed in touch. Iâve bumped into him a couple of times in the street but thatâs all. I think he changes his name from time to time. Why do you ask?â
CHAPTER 5
High on his rocky promontory the Electric Monk continued to sit on a horse which was going quietly and uncomplainingly spare. From under its rough woven cowl the Monk gazed unblinkingly down into the valley, with which it was having a problem, but the problem was a new and hideous one to the Monk, for it was this -- Doubt.
He never suffered it for long, but when he did, it gnawed at the very root of his being.
The day was hot; the sun stood in an empty hazy sky and beat down upon the grey rocks and the scrubby, parched grass. Nothing moved, not even the Monk. But strange things were beginning to fizz in its brain, as they did from time to time when a piece of data became misaddressed as it passed through its input buffer.
But then the Monk began to believe, fitfully and nervously at first, but then with a great searing white flame of belief which overturned all previous beliefs, including the stupid one about the valley being pink, that somewhere

down in the valley, about a mile from where he was sitting, there would shortly open up a mysterious doorway into a strange and distant world, a doorway through which he might enter. An astounding idea.
Astoundingly enough, however, on this one occasion he was perfectly right. The horse sensed that something was up.
It pricked up its ears and gently shook its head. It had gone into a sort of trance looking at the same clump of rocks for so long, and was on the verge of imagining them to be pink itself. It shook its head a little harder.
A slight twitch on the reins, and a prod from the Monkâs heels and they were off, picking their way carefully down the rocky incline. The way was difficult. Much of it was loose shale -- loose brown and grey shale, with the occasional brown and green plant clinging to a precariousexistenceon it.TheMonknoticedthiswithout embarrassment. It was an older, wiser Monk now, and had put childish things behind it. Pink valleys, hermaphrodite tables, these were all natural stages through which one had to pass on the path to true enlightenment.
The sun beat hard on them. The Monk wiped the sweat and dust off its face and paused, leaning forward on the horseâs neck. It peered down through the shimmering heat haze at a large outcrop of rock which stood out on to the floor of the valley. There, behind that outcrop, was where the Monk thought, or rather passionately believed to the core of its being, the door would appear. It tried to focus more closely, but the details of the view swam confusingly in the hot rising air.
As it sat back in its saddle, and was about to prod the horse onward, it suddenly noticed a rather odd thing.
On a flattish wall of rock nearby, in fact so nearby that the Monk was surprised not to have noticed it before, was a large painting. The painting was crudely drawn, though not without a certain stylish sweep of line, and seemed very old, possibly very, very old indeed. The paint was faded, chipped and patchy, and it was difficult to discern with any clarity what the picture was. The Monk

approached the picture more closely. It looked like a primitive hunting scene.
The group of purple, multi-limbed creatures were clearly early hunters. They carried rough spears, and were in hot pursuit of a large horned and armoured creature, which appeared to have been wounded in the hunt already. The colours were now so dim as to be almost non-existent. In fact, all that could be clearly seen was the white of the huntersâ teeth, which seemed to shine with a whiteness whose lustre was undimmed by the passage of what must have been many thousands of years. In fact they even put the Monkâs own teeth to shame, and he had cleaned them only that morning.
The Monk had seen paintings like this before, but only in pictures or on the TV, never in real life. They were usually to be found in caves where they were protected from the elements, otherwise they would not have survived.
The Monk looked more carefully at the immediate environs of the rock wall andnoticed that, though not exactly ina cave, it was nevertheless protected by a large overhang and was well sheltered from the wind and rain. Odd, though, that it should have managed to last so long. Odder still that it should appear not to have been discovered. Such cave paintings as there were were all famous and familiar images, but this was not one that he had ever seen before.
Perhaps this was a dramatic and historic find he had made. Perhaps if he were to return to the city and announce this discovery he would be welcomed back, given a new motherboard after all and allowed to believe -- to believe -- believe what? He paused, blinked, and shook his head to clear a momentary system error.
He pulled himself up short.
He believed in a door. He must find that door. The door was the way to... to... The Door was The Way.
Good.

Capital letters were always the best way of dealing with things you didnât have a good answer to.
Brusquely he tugged the horseâs head round and urged it onward and downward. Within a few minutes more of tricky manoeuvring they had reached the valley floor, and he was momentarily disconcerted to discover that the fine top layer of dust that had settled on the brown parched earth was indeed a very pale brownish pink, particularly on the banks of the sluggish trickle of mud which was all that remained, in the hot season, of the river that flowed through the valley when the rains came. He dismounted and bent down to feel the pink dust and run it through his fingers. It was very fine and soft and felt pleasant as he rubbed it on his skin. It was about the same colour, perhaps a little paler.
The horse was looking at him. He realised, a little belatedly perhaps, that the horse must be extremely thirsty. He was extremely thirsty himself, but had tried to keep his mind off it. He unbuckled the water flask from the saddle. It was pathetically light. He unscrewed the top and took one single swig. Then he poured a little into his cupped hand and offered it to the horse, who slurped at it greedily and briefly.
The horse looked at him again.
The Monk shook his head sadly, resealed the bottle and replaced it. He knew, in that small part of his mind where he kept factual and logical information, that it would not last much longer, and that, without it, neither would they. It was only his Belief that kept him going, currently his Belief in The Door.
He brushed the pink dust from his rough habit, and then stood looking at the rocky outcrop, a mere hundred yards distant. He looked at it not without a slight, tiny trepidation. Although the major part of his mind was firm in its eternal and unshakeable Belief that there would be a Door behind the outcrop, and that the Door would be The Way, yet the tiny part of his brain that understood about the water bottle could not help but recall past disappointments and sounded a very tiny but jarring note of caution.
If he elected not to go and see The Door for himself, then he could continue to

believe in it forever. It would be the lodestone of his life (what little was left of it, said the part of his brain that knew about the water bottle).
If on the other hand he went to pay his respects to the Door and it wasnât there... what then?
The horse whinnied impatiently.
The answer, of course, was very simple. He had a whole board of circuits for dealing with exactly this problem, in fact this was the very heart of his function. He would continue to believe in it whatever the facts turned out to be, what else was the meaning of Belief?
The Door would still be there, even if the door was not.
He pulled himself together. The Door would be there, and he must now go to it, because The Door was The Way.
Instead of remounting his horse, he led it. The Way was but a short way, and he should enter the presence of the Door in humility.
He walked, brave and erect, with solemn slowness. He approached the rocky outcrop. He reached it. He turned the corner. He looked.
The Door was there.
The horse, it must be said, was quite surprised.
The Monk fell to his knees in awe and bewilderment. So braced was he for dealing with the disappointment that was habitually his lot that, though he would never know to admit it, he was completely unprepared for this. He stared at The Door in sheer, blank system error.
It was a door such as he had never seen before. All the doors he knew were great steel-reinforced things, because of all the video recorders and dishwashers that were kept behind them, plus of course all the expensive Electric Monks that were needed to believe in it all. This one was simple,

wooden and small, about his own size. A Monk-size door, painted white, with a single, slightly dented brass knob slightly less than halfway up one side. It was set simply in the rock face, with no explanation as to its origin or purpose.
Hardly knowing how he dared, the poor startled Monk staggered to his feet
and, leading his horse, walked nervously forward towards it. He reached out and touched it. He was so startled when no alarms went off that he jumped back. He touched it again, more firmly this time.
He let his hand drop slowly to the handle -- again, no alarms. He waited to be sure, and then he turned it, very, very gently. He felt a mechanism release. He held his breath. Nothing. He drew the door towards him, and it came easily. He looked inside, but the interior was so dim in contrast with the desert sun outside that he could see nothing. At last, almost dead with wonder, he entered, pulling the horse in after him.
A few minutes later, a figure that had been sitting out of sight around the next outcrop of rock finished rubbing dust on his face, stood up, stretched his limbs and made his way back towards the door, patting his clothes as he did so.
CHAPTER 6
âIn Xanadu did Kubla Khan
A stately pleasure-dome decree:â
The reader clearly belonged to the school of thought which holds that a sense of the seriousness or greatness of a poem is best imparted by reading it in a silly voice. He soared and swooped at the words until they seemed to duck and run for cover.
âWhere Alph, the sacred river ran Through caverns measureless to man

Down to a sunless sea.â
Richard relaxed back into his seat. The words were very, very familiar to him, as they could not help but be to any English graduate of St Ceddâs College, and they settled easily into his mind.
The association of the college with Coleridge was taken very seriously indeed, despite the manâs well-known predilection for certain recreational pharmaceuticals under the influence of which this, his greatest work, was composed, in a dream.
The entire manuscript was lodged in the safe-keeping of the college library, and it was from this itself, on the regular occasion of the Coleridge Dinner, that the poem was read.
âSo twice five miles of fertile ground
With walls and towers were girdled round:
And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills, Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree; And here were forests ancient as the hills, Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.â
Richard wondered how long it took. He glanced sideways at his former Director of Studies and was disturbed by the sturdy purposefulness of his reading posture. The singsong voice irritated him at first, but after a while it began to lull him instead, and he watched a rivulet of wax seeping over the edge of a candle that was burning low now and throwing a guttering light over the carnage of dinner.
âBut oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted

Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover! A savage place! as holy and enchanted
As eâer beneath a waning moon was haunted By woman wailing for her demon-lover!â
The small quantities of claret that he had allowed himself during the course of the meal seeped warmly through his veins, and soon his own mind began to wander, and provoked by Regâs question earlier in the meal, he wondered what had lately become of his former... was friend the word? He seemed more like a succession of extraordinary events than a person. The idea of him actually having friends as such seemed not so much unlikely, more a sort of mismatching of concepts, like the idea of the Suez crisis popping out for a bun.
Svlad Cjelli. Popularly known as Dirk, though, again, âpopularâ was hardly right. Notorious, certainly; sought after, endlessly speculated about, those too were true. But popular? Only in the sense that a serious accident on the motorway might be popular -- everyone slows down to have a good look, but no one will get too close to the flames. Infamous was more like it. Svlad Cjelli, infamously known as Dirk.
He was rounder than the average undergraduate and wore more hats. That is to say, there was just the one hat which he habitually wore, but he wore it with a passion that was rare in one so young. The hat was dark red and round, with a very flat brim, and it appeared to move as if balanced on gimbals, which ensured its perfect horizontality at all times, however its owner moved his head. As a hat it was a remarkableratherthanentirelysuccessful pieceof persona! decoration. It would make an elegant adornment, stylish, shapely and flattering, if the wearer were a small bedside lamp, but not otherwise.People gravitated around him, drawn in by the stories he denied about himself, but what the source of these stories might be, if not his own denials, was never entirely clear.
The tales had to do with the psychic powers that heâd supposedly inherited from his motherâs side of the family who he claimed, had lived at the

smarter end of Transylvania. That is to say, he didnât make any such claim at all, and said it was the most absurd nonsense. He strenuously denied that
there were bats of any kind at all in his family and threatened to sue
anybody who put about such malicious fabrications, but he affected nevertheless to wear a large and flappy leather coat, and had one of those machines in his room which are supposed to help cure bad backs if you hang upside down from them. He would allow people to discover him hanging from this machine at all kinds of odd hours of the day, and more particularly of the night, expressly so that he could vigorously deny that it had any significance whatsoever.
By means of an ingenious series of strategically deployed denials of the most exciting and exotic things, he was able to create the myth thathewasa psychic, mystic,telepathic, fey, clairvoyant, psychosassic vampire bat.
What did âpsychosassicâ mean?
It was his own word and he vigorously denied that it meant anything at all. âAnd from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,
As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,
A mighty fountain momently was forced:
Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst
Huge fragments vaulted...â
Dirk had also been perpetually broke. This would change.
It was his room-mate who started it, a credulous fellow called Mander, who, if the truth were known, had probably been specially selected by Dirk for his credulity.
Steve Mander noticed that if ever Dirk went to bed drunk he would talk in his sleep. Not only that, but the sort of things he would say in his sleep would be

things like, âThe opening up of trade routes to the mumble mumble burble was the turning point for the growth of empire in the snore footle mumble. Discuss.â
â...like rebounding hail,
Or chaffy grain beneath the thresherâs flail:â
The first time this happened Steve Mander sat bolt upright in bed. This was shortly before prelim exams in the second year, and what Dirk had just said, or judiciously mumbled, sounded remarkably like a very likely question in the Economic History paper.
Mander quietly got up, crossed over to Dirkâs bed and listened very hard, but other than a few completely disconnected mumblings about Schleswig- Holstein andthe Franco-Prussian war, the latter being largely directed by Dirk into his pillow, he learned nothing more.
News, however, spread -- quietly, discreetly, and like wildfire. âAnd âmid these dancing rocks at once and ever
It flung up momently the sacred river.â
For the next month Dirk found himself being constantly wined and dined in the hope that he would sleep very soundly that night and dream-speak a few more exam questions. Remarkably, it seemed that the better he was fed, and the finer the vintage of the wine he was given to drink, the less he would tend to sleep facing directly into his pillow.
His scheme, therefore, was to exploit his alleged gifts without ever actually claiming to have them. In fact he would react to stories about his supposed powers with open incredulity, even hostility.
âFive miles meandering with a mazy motion Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,

Then reached the caverns measureless to man, And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean:
And âmid this tumult Kubla heard from far Ancestral voices prophesying war!â
Dirk was also, he denied, a clairaudient. He would sometimes hum tunes in his sleep that two weeks later would turn out to be a hit for someone. Not too difficult to organise, really.
In fact, he had always done the bare minimum of research necessary to support these myths. He was lazy, and essentially what he did was allow peopleâs enthusiastic credulity to do the work for him. The laziness was essential -- if his supposed feats of the paranormal had been detailed and accurate, then people might have been suspicious and looked for other explanations. On the other hand, the more vague and ambiguous his âpredictionsâthe more other peopleâs own wishful thinking would close the credibility gap.
Dirk never made much out of it -- at least, he appeared not to. In fact, the benefit to himself, as a student, of being continually wined and dined at other peopleâs expense was more considerable than anyone would expect unless they sat down and worked out the figures.
And, of course, he never claimed -- in fact, he actively denied -- that any of it was even remotely true.
He was therefore well placed to execute a very nice and tasty little scam come the time of finals.
âThe shadow of the dome of pleasure Floated midway on the waves;
Where was heard the mingled measure

From the fountain and the caves.
It was a miracle of rare device,
A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!â
âGood heavens...!â Reg suddenly seemed to awake with a start from the light doze into which he had gently slipped under the influence of the wine and the reading, and glanced about himself with blank surprise, but nothing had changed. Coleridgeâs words sang through a warm and contented silence that had settled on the great hall. After another quick frown, Reg settled back into another doze, but this time a slightly more attentive one.
âA damsel with a dulcimer
In a vision once I saw:
It was an Abyssinian maid,
And on her dulcimer she played, Singing of Mount Abora.â
Dirk allowed himself to be persuaded to make, under hypnosis, a firm prediction about what questions would be set for examination that summer.
He himself first planted the idea by explaining exactly the sort of thing that he would never, under any circumstances, be prepared to do, though in many ways he would like to, just to have the chance to disprove his alleged and strongly disavowed abilities.
And it was on these grounds, carefully prepared, that he eventually agreed -- only because it would once and for all scotch the whole silly --immensely, tediously silly --business. He would makehis predictions by means of automatic writing under proper supervision, and they would then be sealed in an envelope and deposited at the bank until after the exams.

Then they would be opened to see how accurate they had been after the exams.
He was, not surprisingly, offered some pretty hefty bribes from a pretty hefty number of people to let them see the predictions he had written down, but he was absolutely shocked by the idea. That, he said, would be dishonest...
âCould I revive within me
Her symphony and song,
To such a deep delight âtwould win me,
That with music loud and long,
I would build that dome in air,
That sunny dome! Those caves of ice!â
Then, a short time later, Dirk allowed himself to be seen around town wearing something of a vexed and solemn expression. At first he waved aside enquiries as to what it was that was bothering him, but eventually he let slip that his mother was going to have to undergo some extremely expensive dental work which, for reasons that he refused to discuss, would have to be done privately, only there wasnât the money.
From here, the path downward to accepting donations for his motherâs supposed medical expenses in return for quick glances at his written exam predictions proved to be sufficiently steep and well-oiled for him to be able to slip down it with a minimum of fuss.
Then it further transpired that the only dentist who could perform this mysterious dental operation was an East European surgeon now living in Malibu, and it was in consequence necessary to increase the level of donations rather sharply.

He still denied, of course, that his abilities were all that they were cracked up to be, in fact he denied that they existed at all, and insisted that he would never have embarked on the exercise at all if it wasnât to disprove the whole thing - - and also, since other people seemed, at their own risk, to have a faith in his abilities that he himself did not, he was happy to indulge them to the extent of letting them pay for his sainted motherâs operation.
He could only emerge well from this situation. Or so he thought.
âAnd all who heard should see them there, And all should cry, Beware! Beware!
His flashing eyes, his floating hair!â
The exam papers Dirk produced under hypnosis, by means of automatic writing, he had, in fact, pieced together simply by doing the same minimum research that any student taking exams would do, studying previous exam papers, and seeing what, if any, patterns emerged, and making intelligent guesses about what might come up. He was pretty sure of getting (as anyone would be) a strike rate that was sufficiently high to satisfy the credulous, and sufficiently low for the whole exercise to look perfectly innocent.
As indeed it was.
What completely blew him out of the water, and caused a furore which ended with him being driven out of Cambridge in the back of a Black Maria, was the fact that all the exam papers he sold turned out to be the same as the papers that were actually set.
Exactly. Word for word. To the very comma. âWave a circle round him thrice,
And close your eyes with holy dread,

For he on honey-dew hath fed,
And drunk the milk of Paradise...â
And that, apart from a flurry of sensational newspaper reports which exposed him as a fraud, then trumpeted him as the real thing so that they could have another round of exposing him as a fraud again and then trumpeting him as the real thing again, until they got bored and found a nice juicy snooker player to harass instead, was that.
In the years since then, Richard had run into Dirk from time to time and had usually been greeted with that kind of guarded half smile that wants to know if you think it owes you money before it blossoms into one that hopes you will lend it some. Dirkâs regular name changes suggested to Richard that he wasnât alone in being treated like this.
He felt a tug of sadness that someone who had seemed so shiningly alive within the small confines of a university community should have seemed to fade so much in the light of common day. And he wondered at Regâs asking after him like that, suddenly and out of the blue, in what seemed altogether too airy and casual a manner.
He glanced around him again, at his lightly snoring neighbour, Reg; at little Sarah rapt in silent attention; at the deep hall swathed in darkly glimmering light; at the portraits of old prime ministers and poets hung high in the darkness with just the odd glint of candlelight gleaming off their teeth; at the Director of English Studies standing reading in his poetry-reading voice; at the book of âKubla Khanâ that the Director of English Studies held in his hand; and finally, surreptitiously, at his watch. He settled back again.
The voice continued, reading the second, and altogether stranger part of the poem...

CHAPTER 7
This was the evening of the last day of Gordon Wayâs life, and he was wondering if the rain would hold off for the weekend. The forecast had said changeable -- a misty night tonight followed by bright but chilly days on Friday and Saturday with maybe a few scattered showers towards the end of Sunday when everyone would be heading back into town.
Everyone, that is, other than Gordon Way.
The weather forecast hadnât mentioned that, of course, that wasnât the job of the weather forecast, but then his horoscope had been pretty misleading as well. It had mentioned an unusual amount of planetary activity in his sign and had urged him to differentiate between what he thought he wanted and what he actually needed, and suggested that he should tackle emotional or workproblems with determination and complete honesty, but had inexplicably failed to mention that he would be dead before the day was out.
He turned off the motorway near Cambridge and stopped at a small filling station for some petrol, where he sat for a moment, finishing off a call on his car phone.
âOK, look, Iâll call you tomorrow,â he said, âor maybe later tonight. Or call me. I should be at the cottage in half an hour. Yes, I know how important the project is to you. All right, I know how important it is, full stop. You want it, I want it. Of course I do. And Iâm not saying that we wonât continue to
support it. Iâm just saying itâs expensive and we should look at the whole thing with determination and complete honesty. Look, why donât you come out to the cottage, and we can talk it through. OK, yeah, yes, I know. I understand. Well, think about it, Kate. Talk to you later. Bye.â
He hung up and continued to sit in his car for a moment.
It was a large car. It was a large silver-grey Mercedes of the sort that they use in advertisements, and not just advertisements for Mercedes. Gordon Way, brother of Susan, employer of Richard MacDuff, was a rich man, the founder and owner of WayForward Technologies II. WayForward Technologies itself

had of course gone bust, for the usual reason, taking his entire first fortune with it.
Luckily, he had managed to make another one.
The âusual reasonâ was that he had been in the business of computer hardware when every twelve-year-old in the country had suddenly got bored with boxes that went bing. His second fortune had been made in software instead. As a result of two major pieces of software, one of which was Anthem (the other, more profitable one had never seen the light of day), WFT-II was the only British software company that could be mentioned in the same sentence as such major U.S. companies as Microsoft or Lotus. The sentence would probably run along the lines of âWayForward Technologies, unlike such major U.S. companies as Microsoft or Lotus...â but it was a start. WayForward was in there. And he owned it.
He pushed a tape into the slot on the stereo console. It accepted it with a soft and decorous click, and a moment or two later Ravelâs BolÃ©ro floated out of eight perfectly matched speakers with fine-meshed matte-black grilles. The stereo was so smooth and spacious you could almost sense the whole ice- rink. He tapped his fingers lightly on the padded rim of the steering wheel. He gazed at the dashboard. Tasteful illuminated figures and tiny, immaculate lights gazed dimly back at him. After a while he suddenly realised this was a self service station and got out to fill the tank.
This took a minute or two. He stood gripping the filler nozzle, stamping his feet in the cold night air, then walked over to the small grubby kiosk, paid for the petrol, remembered to buy a couple of local maps, and then stood chatting enthusiastically to the cashier for a few minutes about the directions the computer industry was likely to take in the following year, suggesting that parallel processing was going to be the key to really intuitive productivity software, but also strongly doubtingwhetherartificialintelligenceresearch/perse/, particularly artificial intelligence research based on the ProLog language, was really going to produce any serious commercially viable products in the foreseeable future, at least as far as the office desk top environment was concerned, a topic that fascinated the cashier not at all.

âThe man just liked to talk,â he would later tell the police. âMan, I could have walked away to the toilet for ten minutes and he wouldâve told it all to the till. If Iâd been fifteen minutes the till would have walked away too. Yeah, Iâm sure thatâs him,â he would add when shown a picture of Gordon Way. âI only wasnât sure at first because in the picture heâs got his mouth closed.â
âAndyouâre absolutely certain you didnâtsee anything else suspicious?â the policeman insisted. âNothing that struck you as odd in any way at all?â
âNo, like I said, it was just an ordinary customer on an ordinary night, just like any other night.â
The policeman stared athim blankly. âJust for the sake of argument,â he went on to say, âif I were suddenly to do this...â -- he made himself go cross- eyed, stuck his tongue out of the corner of his mouth and danced up and down twisting his fingers in his ears -- âwould anything strike you about that?â
âWell, er, yeah,â said the cashier, backing away nervously. âIâd think youâd gone stark raving mad.â
âGood,â said the policeman, putting his notebook away. âItâs just that different people sometimes have a different idea of what âoddâ means, you see, sir. If last night was an ordinary night just like any other night, then I am a pimple on the bottom of the Marquess of Queensburyâs aunt. We shall be requiring a statement later, sir. Thank you for your time.â
That was all yet to come.
Tonight, Gordon pushed the maps in his pocket and strolled back towards his car. Standing under the lights in the mist it had gathered a finely beaded coat of matte moisture on it, and looked like -- well, it looked like an extremely expensive Mercedes-Benz. Gordon caught himself, just for a millisecond, wishing that he had something like that, but he was now quite adept at fending off that particular line of thought, which only led off in circles and left him feeling depressed and confused.
He patted it in a proprietorial manner, then, walking around it, noticed that

the boot wasnât closed properly and pushed it shut. It closed with a good healthy clunk. Well, that made it all worth it, didnât it? Good healthy clunk like that. Old-fashioned values of quality and workmanship. He thought of a dozen things he had to talk to Susan about and climbed back into the car, pushing the auto-dial code on his phone as soon as the car was prowling back on to the road.
â...so if youâd like to leave a message, Iâll get back to you as soon as possible. Maybe.â
Beep.âOh, Susan, hi, itâs Gordon,â he said, cradling the phone awkwardly on his shoulder. âJust on my way to the cottage. Itâs er, Thursday night, and itâs, er... 8.47. Bit misty on the roads. Listen, I have those people from the States coming over this weekend to thrash out the distribution on Anthem Version 2.00, handling the promotion, all that stuff, and look you know I donât like to ask you this sort of thing, but you know I always do anyway, so here it is.
âI just need to know that Richard is on the case. I mean really on the case. I can ask him, and he says, Oh sure, itâs fine, but half the time -- shit, that lorry had bright lights, none of these bastard lorry drivers ever dips them properly, itâs a wonder I donât end up dead in the ditch, that would be something, wouldnât it, leaving your famous last words on somebodyâs answering machine, thereâs no reason why these lorries shouldnât have automatic light-activated dipper switches. Look, can you make a note for me to tell Susan -- not you, of course, secretary Susan at the office -- to tell her to send a letter from me to that fellow at the Department of the Environment saying we can provide the technology if he can provide the legislation? Itâs for the public good, and anyway he owes me a favour plus whatâs the point in having a CBE if you canât kick a little ass? You can tell Iâve been talking to Americans all week.
âThat reminds me, God, I hope I remembered to pack the shotguns. What is it with these Americans that theyâre always so mad to shoot my rabbits? I bought them some maps in the hope that I can persuade them to go on long healthy walks and take their minds off shooting rabbits. I really feel quite sorry for the creatures. I think I should put one of those signs on my lawn when the Americans are coming, you know, like they have in Beverly Hills, saying

`Armed Responseâ.
âMake a note to Susan, would you please, to get an `Armed Responseâ sign made up with a sharp spike on the bottom at the right height for rabbits to see. Thatâs secretary Susan at the office not you, of course.
âWhere was I?
âOh yes. Richard and Anthem 2.00. Susan, that thing has got to be in beta testing in two weeks. He tells me itâs fine. But every time I see him heâs got a picture of a sofa spinning on his computer screen. He says itâs an important concept, but all I see is furniture. People who want their company accounts to sing to them do not want to buy a revolving sofa. Nor do I think he should be turning the erosion patterns of the Himalayas into a flute quintet at this time.
âAnd as for what Kateâs up to, Susan, well, I canât hide the fact that I get anxious at the salaries and computer time itâs eating up. Important long-term research and development it might be, but there is also the possibility, only a possibility, Iâm saying, but nevertheless a possibility which I think we owe it to ourselves fully to evaluate and explore, which is that itâs a lemon. Thatâs odd, thereâs a noise coming from the boot, I thought Iâd just closed it properly.
âAnyway, the main thingâs Richard. And the point is that thereâs only one person whoâs really in a position to know if heâs getting the important work done, or if heâs just dreaming, and that one person is, Iâm afraid, Susan.
âThatâs you, I mean, of course, not secretary Susan at the office.
âSo can you, I donât like to ask you this, I really donât, can you really get on his case? Make him see how important it is? Just make sure he realises that WayForward Technologies is meant to be an expanding commercial business, not an adventure playground for crunch-heads. Thatâs the problem with crunch-heads -- they have one great idea that actually works and then they expect you to carry on funding them for years while they sit and calculate the topographies of their navels. Iâm sorry, Iâm going to have to stop and close the boot properly. Wonât be a moment.â

He put the telephone down on the seat beside him, pulled over on to the grass verge, and got out. As he went to the boot, it opened, a figure rose out of it, shot him through the chest with both barrels of a shotgun and then went about its business.
Gordon Wayâs astonishment at being suddenly shot dead was nothing to his astonishment at what happened next.
CHAPTER 8
âCome in, dear fellow, come in.â
The door to Regâs set of rooms in college was up a winding set of wooden stairs in the corner of Second Court, and was not well lit, or rather it was perfectly well lit when the light was working, but the light was not working, so the door was not well lit and was, furthermore, locked. Reg was having difficulty in finding the key from a collection which looked like something that a fit Ninja warrior could hurl through the trunk of a tree.
Rooms in the older parts of the college have double doors, like airlocks, and like airlocks they are fiddly to open. The outer door is a sturdy slab of grey painted oak, with no features other than a very narrow slit for letters, and a Yale lock, to which suddenly Reg at last found the key.
He unlocked it and pulled it open. Behind it lay an ordinary white-panelled door with an ordinary brass doorknob.
âCome in, come in,â repeated Reg, opening this and fumbling for the light switch. For a moment only the dying embers of a fire in the stone grate threw ghostly red shadows dancing around the room, but then electric light flooded it and extinguished the magic. Reg hesitated on the threshold for a moment, oddly tense, as if wishing to be sure of something before he entered, then bustled in with at least the appearance of cheeriness.

It was a large panelled room, which a collection of gently shabby furniture contrived to fill quite comfortably. Against the far wall stood a large and battered old mahogany table with fat ugly legs, which was laden with books, files, folders and teetering piles of papers. Standing in its own space on the desk, Richard was amused to note, was actually a battered old abacus.
There was a small Regency writing desk standing nearby which might have been quite valuable had it not been knocked about so much, also a couple of elegant Georgian chairs, a portentous Victorian bookcase, and so on. It was, in short, a donâs room. It had a donâs framed maps and prints on the walls a threadbare and faded donâs carpet on the floor, and it looked as if little had changed in it for decades, which was probably the case because a don lived in it.
Two doors led out from either end of the opposite wall, and Richard knew
from previous visits that one led to a study which looked much like a smaller and more intense version of this room -- larger clumps of books, taller piles of paper in more imminent danger of actually falling, furniture which, however old and valuable, was heavily marked with myriad rings of hot tea or coffee cups, on many of which the original cups themselves were probably still standing.
The other door led to a small and rather basically equipped kitchen, and a twisty internal staircase at the top of which lay the Professorâs bedroom and bathroom.
âTry and make yourself comfortable on the sofa,â invited Reg, fussing around hospitably. âI donât know if youâll manage it. It always feels to me as
if itâs been stuffed with cabbage leaves and cutlery.â He peered at Richard seriously. âDo you have a good sofa?â he enquired.âWell, yes.â Richard laughed. He was cheered by the silliness of the question.
âOh,â said Reg solemnly. âWell, I wish youâd tell me where you got it. I have endless trouble with them, quite endless. Never found a comfortable one in all my life. How do you find yours?â He encountered, with a slight air of surprise, a small silver tray he had left out with a decanter of port and three

glasses.
âWell, itâs odd you should ask that,â said Richard. âIâve never sat on it.â
âVery wise,â insisted Reg earnestly, âvery, very wise.â He went through a palaver similar to his previous one with his coat and hat.
âNot that I wouldnât like to,â said Richard. âItâs just that itâs stuck halfway up a long flight of stairs which leads up into my flat. As far as I can make it out, the delivery men got it part way up the stairs, got it stuck, turned it around any way they could, couldnât get it any further, and then found, curiously enough, that they couldnât get it back down again. Now, that should be impossible.â
âOdd,âagreedReg. âIâvecertainly never comeacrossany irreversible mathematics involving sofas. Could be a new field. Have you spoken to any spatial geometricians?â
âI did better than that. I called in a neighbourâs kid who used to be able to solve Rubikâs cube in seventeen seconds. He sat on a step and stared at it for over an hour before pronouncing it irrevocably stuck. Admittedly heâs a few years older now and has found out about girls, but itâs got me puzzled.â
âCarry on talking, my dear fellow, Iâm most interested, but let me know first if thereâs anything I can get you. Port perhaps? Or brandy? The port I think is the better bet, laid down by the college in 1934, one of the finest vintages I think youâll find, and on the other hand I donât actually have any brandy. Or coffee? Some more wine perhaps? Thereâs an excellent Margaux Iâve been looking for an excuse to open, though it should of course be allowed to stand open for an hour or two, which is not to say that I couldnât... no,â he said hurriedly, âprobably best not to go for the Margaux tonight.â
âTea is what I would really like,â said Richard, âif you have some.âReg raised his eyebrows. âAre you sure?â
âI have to drive home.â
âIndeed. Then I shall be a moment or two in the kitchen. Please carry on, I

shall still be able to hear you. Continue to tell me of your sofa, and do feel free in the meantime to sit on mine. Has it been stuck there for long?â
âOh, only about three weeks,â said Richard, sitting down. âI could just saw it up and throw it away, but I canât believe that there isnât a logical answer. And it also made me think -- it would be really useful to know before you buy a piece of furniture whether itâs actually going to fit up the stairs or around the corner. So Iâve modelled the problem in three dimensions on my computer -- and so far it just says no way.â
âIt says what?â called Reg, over the noise of filling the kettle.
âThat it canât be done. I told it to compute the moves necessary to get the sofa out, and it said there arenât any. I said âWhat?â and it said there arenât any. I then asked it, and this is the really mysterious thing, to compute the moves necessary to get the sofa into its present position in the first place, and it said that it couldnât have got there. Not without fundamental restructuring of the walls. So, either thereâs something wrong with the fundamental structure of the matter in my walls or,â he added with a sigh, âthereâs something wrong with the program. Which would you guess?â
âAnd are you married?â called Reg.
âWhat? Oh, I see what you mean. A sofa stuck on the stairs for a month. Well, no, not married as such, but yes, there is a specific girl that Iâm not married to.â
âWhatâs she like? What does she do?â
âSheâs a professional cellist. I have to admit that the sofa has been a bit of a talking point. In fact sheâs moved back to her own flat until I get it sorted out. She, well...â
He was suddenly sad, and he stood up and wandered around the room in a desultory sort of way and ended up in front of the dying fire. He gave it a bit of a poke and threw on a couple of extra logs to try and ward off the chill of the room.

âSheâs Gordonâs sister, in fact,â he added at last. âBut they are very different. Iâm not sure she really approves of computers very much. And she doesnât much like his attitude to money. I donât think I entirely blame her, actually, and she doesnât know the half of it.â
âWhich is the half she doesnât know?â
Richard sighed.
âWell,â he said, âitâs to do with the project which first made the software incarnation of the company profitable. It was called Reason, and in its own way it was sensational.â
âWhat was it?â
âWell, it was a kind of back-to-front program. Itâs funny how many of the best ideas are just an old idea back-to-front. You see there have already been several programs written that help you to arrive at decisions by properly ordering and analysing all the relevant facts so that they then point naturally towards the right decision. The drawback with these is that the decision which all the properly ordered and analysed facts point to is not necessarily the one you want.â
âYeeeess...â said Regâs voice from the kitchen.
âWell, Gordonâs great insight was to design a program which allowed you to specify in advance what decision you wished it to reach, and only then to give it all the facts. The programâs task, which it was able to accomplish with consummate ease, was simply to construct a plausible series of logical- sounding steps to connect the premises with the conclusion.
âAnd I have to say that it worked brilliantly. Gordon was able to buy himself a Porsche almost immediately despite being completely broke and a hopeless driver. Even his bank manager was unable to find fault with his reasoning. Even when Gordon wrote it off three weeks later.â

âHeavens. And did the program sell very well?ââNo. We never sold a single copy.â
âYou astonish me. It sounds like a real winner to me.â
âIt was,â said Richard hesitantly. âThe entire project was bought up, lock, stock and barrel, by the Pentagon. The deal put WayForward on a very sound financial foundation. Its moral foundation, on the other hand, is not something I would want to trust my weight to. Iâve recently been analysing a lot of the arguments put forward in favour of the Star Wars project, and if you know what youâre looking for, the pattern of the algorithms is very clear.
âSo much so, in fact, that looking at Pentagon policies over the last couple of years I think I can be fairly sure that the US Navy is using version 2.00 of the program, while the Air Force for some reason only has the beta-test version of 1.5. Odd, that.â
âDo you have a copy?â
âCertainly not,â said Richard, âI wouldnât have anything to do with it. Anyway, whenthePentagonboughteverything, they bought everything. Every scrap of code, every disk, every notebook. I was glad to see the back of it. If indeed we have. I just busy myself with my own projects.â
He poked at the fire again and wondered what he was doing here when he had so much work on. Gordon was on at him continually about getting the new, super version of Anthem ready for taking advantage of the Macintosh II, and he was well behind with it. And as for the proposed module for converting incoming Dow Jones stock-market information into MIDI data in real time, heâd only meant that as a joke, but Gordon, of course,hadflipped overthe idea and insisted on its being implemented. That too was meant to be ready but wasnât. He suddenly knew exactly why it was he was here.
Well, it had been a pleasant evening, even if he couldnât see why Reg had been quite so keen to see him. He picked up a couple of books from the table. The table obviously doubled as a dining table, because although the piles looked as if they had been there for weeks, the absence of dust immediately

around them showed that they had been moved recently.
Maybe, he thought, the need for amiable chit-chat with someone different can become as urgent as any other need when you live in a community as enclosed as a Cambridge college was, even nowadays. He was a likeable old fellow, but it was clear from dinner that many of his colleagues found his eccentricities formed rather a rich sustained diet -- particularly when they had so many of their own to contend with. A thought about Susan nagged him, but
he was used to that. He flipped through the two books heâd picked up.
One of them, an elderly one, was an account of the hauntings of Borley Rectory, the most haunted house in England. Its spine was getting raggedy, and the photographic plates were so grey and blurry as to be virtually indistinguishable. A picture he thought must be a very lucky (or faked) shot of a ghostly apparition turned out, when he examined the caption, to be a portrait of the author.
The other book was more recent, and by an odd coincidence was a guide to the Greek islands. He thumbed through it idly and a piece of paper fell out.
âEarl Grey or Lapsang Souchong?â called out Reg. âOr Darjeeling? Or PG Tips? Itâs all tea bags anyway, Iâm afraid. And none of them very fresh.â
âDarjeeling will do fine,â replied Richard, stooping to pick up the piece of paper.
âMilk?â called Reg. âEr, please.â
âOne lump or two?â âOne, please.â
Richard slipped the paper back into the book, noticing as he did so that it had a hurriedly scribbled note on it. The note said, oddly enough, âRegard this simple silver salt cellar. Regard this simple hat.â

âSugar?â
âEr, what?â said Richard, startled. He put the book hurriedly back on the pile.
âJust a tiny joke of mine,â said Reg cheerily, âto see if people are listening.â He emerged beaming from the kitchen carrying a small tray with two cups on it, which he hurled suddenly to the floor. The tea splashed over the carpet. One of the cups shattered and the other bounced under the table. Reg leaned against the door frame, white-faced and staring.
A frozen instant of time slid silently by while Richard was too startled to react, then he leaped awkwardly forward to help. But the old man was already apologising and offering to make him another cup. Richard helped him to the sofa.
âAre you all right?â asked Richard helplessly. âShall I get a doctor?â
Reg waved him down. âItâs all right,â he insisted, âIâm perfectly well. Thought I heard, well, a noise that startled me. But it was nothing. Just overcome with the tea fumes, I expect. Let me just catch my breath. I think a little, er, port will revive me excellently. So sorry, I didnât mean to startle you.â He waved in the general direction of the port decanter. Richard hurriedly poured a small glass and gave it to him.
âWhat kind of noise?â he asked, wondering what on earth could shock him so much.
At that moment came thesound of movement upstairsand an extraordinary kind of heavy breathing noise.
âThat...â whispered Reg. The glass of port lay shattered at his feet. Upstairs someone seemed to be stamping. âDid you hear it?â
âWell, yes.â
This seemed to relieve the old man.

Richard looked nervously up at the ceiling. âIs there someone up there?â he asked, feeling this was a lame question, but one that had to be asked.
âNo,â said Reg in a low voice that shocked Richard with the fear it carried, âno one. Nobody that should be there.â
âThen...â
Reg was struggling shakily to his feet, but there was suddenly a fierce determination about him.
âI must go up there,â he said quietly. âI must. Please wait for me here.â
âLook, what is this?â demanded Richard, standing between Reg and the doorway. âWhat is it, a burglar? Look, Iâll go. Iâm sure itâs nothing, itâs just the wind or something.â Richard didnât know why he was saying this. It clearly wasnât the wind, or even anything like the wind, because though the wind might conceivably make heavy breathing noises, it rarely stamped its feet in that way.
âNo,â the old man said, politely but firmly moving him aside, âit is for me to do.â
Richard followed him helplessly through the door into the small hallway, beyond which lay the tiny kitchen. A dark wooden staircase led up from here; the steps seemed damaged and scuffed.
Reg turned on a light. It was a dim one that hung naked at the top of the stairwell, and he looked up it with grim apprehension.
âWait here,â he said, and walked up two steps. He then turned and faced Richard with a look of the most profound seriousness on his face.âI am sorry,â he said, âthat you have become involved in what is... the more difficult side of my life. But you are involved now, regrettable though that may be, and there is something I must ask you. I do not know what awaits me up there, do not know exactly. I do not know if it is something which I have foolishly

brought upon myself with my... my hobbies, or if it is something to which I have fallen an innocent victim. If it is the former, then I have only myself to blame, for I am like a doctor who cannot give up smoking, or perhaps worse still, like an ecologist who cannot give up his car -- if the latter, then I hope it may not happen to you.
âWhat I must ask you is this. When I come back down these stairs, always supposing of course that I do, then if my behaviour strikes you as being in any way odd, if I appear not to be myself, then you must leap on me and wrestle me to the ground. Do you understand? You must prevent me from doing anything I may try to do.â
âBut how will I know?â asked an incredulous Richard. âSorry I donât mean it to sound like that, but I donât know what...?â
âYou will know,â said Reg. âNow please wait for me in the main room. And close the door.â
Shaking his head in bewilderment, Richard stepped back and did as he was asked. From inside the large untidy room he listened to the sound of the Professorâs tread mounting the stairs one at a time.
He mounted them with a heavy deliberation, like the ticking of a great, slow clock.
Richard heard him reach the top landing. There he paused in silence. Seconds went by, five, maybe ten, maybe twenty. Then came again the heavy movement and breath that had first so harrowed the Professor.
Richard moved quickly to the door but did not open it. The chill of the room oppressed and disturbed him. He shook his head to try and shake off the feeling, and then held his breath as the footsteps started once again slowly to traverse the two yards of the landing and to pause there again.
After only a few seconds, this time Richard heard the long slow squeak of a door being opened inch by inch, inch by cautious inch, until it must surely now at last be standing wide agape.

Nothing further seemed to happen for a long, long time. Then at last the door closed once again, slowly.
The footsteps crossed the landing and paused again. Richard backed a few slight paces from the door, staring fixedly at it. Once more the footsteps started to descend the stairs, slowly, deliberately and quietly, until at last they reached the bottom. Then after a few seconds more the door handle began to rotate. The door opened and Reg walked calmly in.
âItâs all right, itâs just a horse in the bathroom,â he said quietly. Richard leaped on him and wrestled him to the ground.
âNo,â gasped Reg, âno, get off me, let me go, Iâm perfectly all right, damn it. Itâs just a horse, a perfectly ordinary horse.â He shook Richard off with no great difficulty and sat up, puffing and blowing and pushing his hands through his limited hair. Richard stood over him warily, but with great and mounting embarrassment. He edged back, and let Reg stand up and sit on a chair.
âJust a horse,â said Reg, âbut, er, thank you for taking me at my word.â He brushed himself down.
âA horse,â repeated Richard.
âYes,â said Reg.
Richard went out and looked up the stairs and then came back in.
âA horse?â he said again.
âYes, it is,â said the Professor. âWait --â he motioned to Richard, who was about to go out again and investigate -- âlet it be. It wonât be long.â
Richard stared in disbelief. âYou say thereâs a horse in your bathroom, and

all you can do is stand there naming Beatles songs?â The Professor looked blankly at him.
âListen,â he said, âIâm sorry if I... alarmed you earlier, it was just a slight turn. These things happen, my dear fellow, donât upset yourself about it. Dear me, Iâve known odder things in my time. Many of them. Far odder. Sheâs only a horse, for heavenâs sake. Iâll go and let her out later. Please donât concern yourself. Let us revive our spirits with some port.â
âBut... how did it get in there?â
âWell, the bathroom windowâs open. I expect she came in through that.â
Richard looked at him, not for the first and certainly not for the last time, through eyes that were narrowed with suspicion.
âYouâre doing it deliberately, arenât you?â he said.
âDoing what, my dear fellow?â
âI donât believe thereâs a horse in your bathroom,â said Richard suddenly. âI donât know what is there, I donât know what youâre doing, I donât know what any of this evening means, but I donât believe thereâs a horse in your bathroom.â And brushing aside Regâs further protestations he went up to look.
The bathroom was not large.
The walls were panelled in old oak linenfold which, given the age and nature of the building, was quite probably priceless, but otherwise the fittings were stark and institutional.
There was old, scuffed, black-and-white checked linoleum on the floor, a small basic bath, well cleaned but with very elderly stains and chips in the enamel, and also a small basic basin with a toothbrush and toothpaste in a Duralex beaker standing next to the taps. Screwed into the probably priceless panelling above the basin was a tin mirror-fronted bathroom cabinet. It looked

as if it had been repainted many times, and the mirror was stained round the edges with condensation. The lavatory had an old-fashioned cast-iron chain- pull cistern. There was an old cream-painted wooden cupboard standing in the corner, with an old brown bentwood chair next to it, on which lay some neatly folded but threadbare small towels. There was also a large horse in the room, taking up most of it.
Richard stared at it, and it stared at Richard in an appraising kind of way. Richard swayed slightly. The horse stood quite still. After a while it looked at the cupboard instead. It seemed, if not content, then at least perfectly resigned to being where it was until it was put somewhere else. It also seemed... what was it?
It was bathed in the glow of the moonlight that streamed in through the window. The window was open but small and was, besides, on the second floor, so the notion that the horse had entered by that route was entirely fanciful.
There was something odd about the horse, but he couldnât say what. Well, there was one thing that was clearly very odd about it indeed, which was that it was standing in a college bathroom. Maybe that was all.
He reached out, rather tentatively, to pat the creature on its neck. It felt normal - - firm, glossy, it was in good condition. The effect of the moonlight on its coat was a little mazy, but everything looks a little odd by moonlight. The horse shook its mane a little when he touched it, but didnât seem to mind too much.
After the success of patting it, Richard stroked it a few times and scratched it gently under the jaw. Then he noticed that there was another door into the bathroom, in the far corner. He moved cautiously around the horse and approached the other door. He backed up against it and pushed it open tentatively.
It just opened into the Professorâs bedroom, a small room cluttered with books and shoes and a small single bed. This room, too, had another door, which opened out on to the landing again.

Richard noticed that the floor of the landing was newly scuffed and scratched as the stairs had been, and these marks were consistent with the idea that the horse had somehow been pushed up the stairs. He wouldnât have liked to have had to do it himself, and he would have liked to have been the horse having it done to him even less, but it was just about possible.
But why? He had one last look at the horse, which had one last look back at him, and then he returned downstairs.
âI agree,â he said. âYou have a horse in your bathroom and I will, after all, have a little port.â
He poured some for himself, and then some for Reg, who was quietly contemplating the fire and was in need of a refill.
âJust as well I did put out three glasses after all,â said Reg chattily. âI wondered why earlier, and now I remember.âYou asked if you could bring a friend, but appear not to have done so. On account of the sofa no doubt. Never mind, these things happen. Whoa, not too much, youâll spill it.â
All horse-related questions left Richardâs mind abruptly. âI did?â he said.
âOh yes. I remember now. You rang me back to ask me if it would be all right, as I recall. I said I would be charmed, and fully intended to be. Iâd saw the thing up if I were you. Donât want to sacrifice your happiness to a sofa. Or maybe she decided that an evening with your old tutor would be blisteringly dull and opted for the more exhilarating course of washing her hair instead. Dear me, I know what I would have done. Itâs only lack of hair that forces me to pursue such a hectic social round these days.â
It was Richardâs turn to be white-faced and staring.
Yes, he had assumed that Susan would not want to come.
Yes, he had said to her it would be terribly dull. But she had insisted that she

wanted to come because it would be the only way sheâd get to see his face for a few minutes not bathed in the light of a computer screen, so he had agreed and arranged that he would bring her after all.
Only he had completely forgotten this. He had not picked her up. He said, âCan I use your phone, please?â
CHAPTER 9
Gordon Way lay on the ground, unclear about what to do.
He was dead. There seemed little doubt about that. There was a horrific hole in his chest, but the blood that was gobbing out of it had slowed to a trickle. Otherwise there was no movement from his chest at all, or, indeed, from any other part of him.
He looked up, and from side to side, and it became clear to him that whatever part of him it was that was moving, it wasnât any part of his body.
The mist rolled slowly over him, and explained nothing. At a few feet distant from him his shotgun lay smoking quietly in the grass.
He continued to lie there, like someone lying awake at four oâclock in the morning, unable to put their mind to rest, but unable to find anything to do with it. He realised that he had just had something of a shock, which might account for his inability to think clearly, but didnât account for his ability actually to think at all.
In the great debate that has raged for centuries about what, if anything, happens to you after death, be it heaven, hell, purgatory or extinction, one thing has never been in doubt -- that you would at least know the answer when you were dead.

Gordon Way was dead, but he simply hadnât the slightest idea what he was meant to do about it. It wasnât a situation he had encountered before.
He sat up. The body that sat up seemed as real to him as the body that still lay slowly cooling on the ground, giving up its blood heat in wraiths of steam that mingled with the mist of the chill night air.Experimentingabit further, hetried standing up, slowly, wonderingly and wobblingly. The ground seemed to give him support, it took his weight. But then of course he appeared to have no weight that needed to be taken. When he bent to touch the ground he could feel nothing save a kind of distant rubbery resistance like the sensation you get if you try and pick something up when your arm has gone dead. His arm had gone dead. His legs too, and his other arm, and all his torso and his head.
His body was dead. He could not say why his mind was not.
He stood in a kind of frozen, sleepless horror while the mist curled slowly through him.
He looked back down at the him, the ghastly, astonished-looking him-thing lying still and mangled on the ground, and his flesh wanted to creep. Or rather, he wanted flesh that could creep. He wanted flesh. He wanted body. He had none.
A sudden cry of horror escaped from his mouth but was nothing and went nowhere. He shook and felt nothing.
Music and a pool of light seeped from his car. He walked towards it. He tried to walk sturdily, but it was a faint and feeble kind of walking, uncertain and, well, insubstantial. The ground felt frail beneath his feet.
The door of the car was still open on the driverâs side, as he had left it when he had leaped out to deal with the boot lid, thinking heâd only be two seconds.
That was all of two minutes ago now, when heâd been alive. When heâd been a person. When heâd thought he was going to be leaping straight back in and driving off. Two minutes and a lifetime ago.

This was insane, wasnât it? he thought suddenly.
He walked around the door and bent down to peer into the external rear-view mirror.
He looked exactly like himself, albeit like himself after heâd had a terrible fright, which was to be expected, but that was him, that was normal. This must be something he was imagining, some horrible kind of waking dream. He had a sudden thought and tried breathing on the rear-view mirror.
Nothing. Not a single droplet formed. That would satisfy a doctor, thatâs what they always did on television -- if no mist formed on the mirror, there was no breath. Perhaps, he thought anxiously to himself, perhaps it was something to do with having heated wing mirrors. Didnât this car have heated wing mirrors? Hadnât the salesman gone on and on about heated this, electric that, and servo- assisted the other? Maybe they were digital wing mirrors. That was it. Digital, heated, servo-assisted, computer-controlled, breath-resistant wing mirrors...
He was, he realised, thinking complete nonsense. He turned slowly and gazed again in apprehension at the body lying on the ground behind him with half its chest blown away. That would certainly satisfy a doctor. The sight would be appalling enough if it was somebody elseâs body, but his own...
He was dead. Dead... dead... He tried to make the word toll dramatically in his mind, but it wouldnât. He was not a film sound track, he was just dead.
Peering at his body in appalled fascination, he gradually became distressed by the expression of asinine stupidity on its face.
It was perfectly understandable, of course. It was just such an expression as somebody who is in the middle of being shot with his own shotgun by somebody who had been hiding in the boot of his car might be expected to wear, but he nevertheless disliked the idea that anyone might find him looking like that.
He knelt down beside it in the hope of being able to rearrange his

featuresintosomesemblanceof dignity, or atleast basic intelligence.
It proved to be almost impossibly difficult. He tried to knead the skin, the sickeningly familiar skin, but somehow he couldnât seem to get a proper grip on it, or on anything. It was like trying to model plasticine when your arm has gone to sleep, except that instead of his grip slipping off the model, it would slip through it. In this case, his hand slipped through his face.
Nauseated horror and rage swept through him at his sheer bloody blasted impotence, and he was suddenly startled to find himself throttling and shaking his own dead body with a firm and furious grip. He staggered back in amazed shock. All he had managed to do was to add to the inanely stupefied look of the corpse a twisted-up mouth and a squint. And bruises flowering on its neck.
He started to sob, and this time sound seemed to come, a strange howling from deep within whatever this thing he had become was. Clutching his hands to his face, he staggered backwards, retreated to his car and flung himself into the seat. The seat received him in a loose and distant kind of way, like an aunt who disapproves of the last fifteen years of your life and will therefore furnish you with a basic sherry, but refuses to catch your eye.
Could he get himself to a doctor?
To avoid facing the absurdity of the idea he grappled violently with the steering wheel, but his hands slipped through it. He tried to wrestle with the automatic transmission shift and ended up thumping it in rage, but not being able properly to grasp or push it.
The stereo was still playing light orchestral music into the telephone, which had been lying on the passenger seat listening patiently all this time. He stared at it and realised with a growing fever of excitement that he was still connected to Susanâs telephone-answering machine. It was the type that would simply run and run until he hung up. He was still in contact with the world.
He tried desperately to pick up the receiver, fumbled, let it slip, and was in the

end reduced to bending himself down over its mouthpiece. âSusan!â he cried into it, his voice a hoarse and distant wail on the wind. âSusan, help me! Help me for Godâs sake. Susan, Iâm dead... Iâm dead... Iâm dead and... I donât know what to do...â He broke down again, sobbing in desperation, and tried to cling to the phone like a baby clinging to its blanket for comfort.
âHelp me, Susan...â he cried again. âBeep,â said the phone.
He looked down at it again where he was cuddling it. He had managed to push something after all. He had managed to push the button which disconnected the call. Feverishly he attempted to grapple the thing again, but it constantly slipped through his fingers and eventually lay immobile on the seat. He could not touch it. He could not push the buttons. In rage he flung it at the windscreen. It responded to that, all right. It hit the windscreen, careered straight back though him, bounced off the seat and then lay still on the transmission tunnel, impervious to all his further attempts to touch it.
For several minutes still he sat there, his head nodding slowly as terror began to recede into blank desolation.
A couple of cars passed by, but would have noticed nothing odd -- a car stopped by the wayside. Passing swiftly in the night their headlights would probably not have picked out the body lying in the grass behind the car. They certainly would not have noticed a ghost sitting inside it crying to himself.
He didnât know how long he sat there. He was hardly aware of time passing, only that it didnât seem to pass quickly. There was little external stimulus to mark its passage. He didnât feel cold. In fact he could almost not remember what cold meant or felt like, he just knew that it was something he would have expected to feel at this moment.
Eventually he stirred from his pathetic huddle. He would have to do something, though he didnât know what. Perhaps he should try and reach his cottage, though he didnât know what he would do when he got there. He just needed

something to try for. He needed to make it through the night.
Pulling himself together he slipped out of the car, his foot and knee grazing easily through part of the door frame. He went to look again at his body, but it wasnât there.
As if the night hadnât produced enough shocks already. He started, and stared at the damp depression in the grass.
His body was not there.
CHAPTER 10
Richard made the hastiest departure that politeness would allow.
He said thank you very much and what a splendid evening it had been and that any time Reg was coming up to London he must let him, Richard, know and was there anything he could do to help about the horse. No? Well, all right then, if youâre sure, and thank you again, so much.
He stood there for a moment or two after the door finally closed, pondering things.
He had noticed during the short time that the light from Regâs room flooded out on to the landing of the main staircase, that there were no marks on the floorboards there at all. It seemed odd that the horse should only have scuffed the floorboards inside Regâs room.
Well, it all seemed very odd, full stop, but here was yet another curious fact to add to the growing pile. This was supposed to have been a relaxing evening away from work.
On an impulse he knocked on the door opposite to Regâs. It took such a long time to be answered that Richard had given up and was turning to go when at

last he heard the door creak open.
He had a slight shock when he saw that staring sharply up at him like a small and suspicious bird was the don with the racing-yacht keel for a nose.
âEr, sorry,â said Richard, abruptly, âbut, er, have you seen or heard a horse coming up this staircase tonight?â
The man stopped his obsessive twitching of his fingers. He cocked his head slightly on one side and then seemed to need to go on a long journey inside himself to find a voice, which when found turned out to be a thin and soft little one.
He said, âThat is the first thing anybody has said to me for seventeen years, three months and two days, five hours, nineteen minutes and twenty seconds. Iâve been counting.â
He closed the door softly again.
Richard virtually ran through Second Court.
When he reached First Court he steadied himself and slowed down to a walking pace.
The chill night air was rasping in his lungs and there was no point in running. He hadnât managed to talk to Susan because Regâs phone wasnât working,andthis wasanother thing that he had been mysteriously coy about. That at least was susceptible of a rational explanation. He probably hadnât paid his phone bill.
Richard was about to emerge out on to the street when instead he decided to pay a quick visit to the porterâs lodge, which was tucked away inside the great archway entrance into the college. It was a small hutchlike place filled with keys, messages and a single electric bar heater. A radio nattered to itself in the background.
âExcuse me,â he said to the large black-suited man standing behind the counter

with his arms folded. âI...â
âYes, Mr MacDuff, what can I do for you?â
In his present state of mind Richard would have been hard-pressed himself to remember his own name and was startled for a moment. However, college porters are legendary for their ability to perform such feats of memory, and for their tendency to show them off at the slightest provocation.
âIs there,â said Richard, âa horse anywhere in the college -- that you know of? I mean, you would know if there was a horse in the college, wouldnât you?â
The porter didnât blink.
âNo, sir, and yes, sir. Anything else I can help you with, Mr MacDuff, sir?â
âEr, no,â said Richard and tapped his fingers a couple of times on the counter. âNo. Thank you. Thank you very much for your help. Nice to see you again, er... Bob,â he hazarded. âGood-night, then.â
He left.
The porter remained perfectly still with his arms folded, but shaking his head a very, very little bit.
âHereâs some coffee for you, Bill,â said another porter, a short wiry one, emerging from an inner sanctum with a steaming cup. âGetting a bit colder tonight?â
âI think it is, Fred, thanks,â said Bill, taking the cup.
He took a sip. âYou can say what you like about people, they donât get any less peculiar. Fellow in here just now asking if there was a horse in the college.â
âOh yes?â Fred sipped at his own coffee, and let the steam smart his eyes. âI had a chap in here earlier. Sort of strange foreign priest. Couldnât understand a

word he said at first. But he seemed happy just to stand by the fire and listen to the news on the radio.â
âForeigners, eh.â
âIn the end I told him to shoot off. Standing in front of my fire like that. Suddenly he says is that really what he must do? Shoot off? I said, in my best Bogart voice, âYou better believe it, buddy.âââReally? Sounded more like Jimmy Cagney to me.â
âNo, thatâs my Bogart voice. This is my Jimmy Cagney voice -- âYou better believe it, buddy.ââ
Bill frowned at him. âIs that your Jimmy Cagney voice? I always thought that was your Kenneth McKellar voice.â
âYou donât listen properly, Bill, you havenât got the ear. This is Kenneth McKellar. âOh, you take the high road and Iâll take the low road...ââ
âOh, I see. I was thinking of the Scottish Kenneth McKellar. So what did this priest fellow say then, Fred?â
âOh, he just looked me straight in the eyes, Bill, and said in this strange sort of...â
âSkip the accent, Fred, just tell me what he said, if itâs worth hearing.â âHe just said he did believe me.â
âSo. Not a very interesting story then, Fred.â
âWell, maybe not. I only mention it because he also said that heâd left his horse in a washroom and would I see that it was all right.â

CHAPTER 11
Gordon Way drifted miserably along the dark road, or rather, tried to drift.
He felt that as a ghost -- which is what he had to admit to himself he had become -- he should be able to drift. He knew little enough about ghosts, but he felt that if you were going to be one then there ought to be certain compensations for not having a physical body to lug around, and that among them ought to be the ability simply to drift. But no, it seemed he was going to have to walk every step of the way.
His aim was to try and make it to his house. He didnât know what he would do when he got there, but even ghosts have to spend the night somewhere, and he felt that being in familiar surroundings might help. Help what, he didnât know. At least the journey gave him an objective, and he would just have to think of another one when he arrived.
He trudged despondently from lamppost to lamppost, stopping at each one to look at bits of himself.
He was definitely getting a bit wraithlike.
At times he would fade almost to nothing, and would seem to be little more than a shadow playing in the mist, a dream of himself that could just evaporate and be gone. At other times he seemed to be almost solid and real again. Once or twice he would try leaning against a lamppost, and would fall straight through it if he wasnât careful.
At last, and with great reluctance, he actually began to turn his mind to what it was that had happened. Odd, that reluctance. He really didnât want to think about it. Psychologists say that the mind will often try to suppress the memory of traumatic events, and this, he thought, was probably the answer. After all, if having a strange figure jump out of the boot of your own car and shoot you dead didnât count as a traumatic experience, heâd like to know what did.
He trudged on wearily.

He tried to recall the figure to his mindâs eye, but it was like probing a hurting tooth, and he thought of other things.
Like, was his will up-to-date? He couldnât remember, and made a mental note to call his lawyer tomorrow, and then made another mental note that he would have to stop making mental notes like that.
How would his company survive without him? He didnât like either of the possible answers to that very much.
What about his obituary? There was a thought that chilled him to his bones, wherever theyâd got to. Would he be able to get hold of a copy? What would it say? Theyâd better give him a good write-up, the bastards. Look at what heâd done. Single-handedly saved the British software industry: huge exports, charitable contributions, research scholarships, crossing the Atlantic in a solar-poweredsubmarine (failed, but a good try) -- all sorts of things. Theyâd better not go digging up that Pentagon stuff again or heâd get his lawyer on to them. He made a mental note to call him in the mor...
No.
Anyway, can a dead person sue for libel? Only his lawyer would know, and he was not going to be able to call him in the morning. He knew with a sense of creeping dread that of all the things he had left behind in the land of the living it was the telephone that he was going to miss the most, and then he turned his mind determinedly back to where it didnât want to go.
The figure.
It seemed to him that the figure had been almost like a figure of Death itself; or was that his imagination playing tricks with him? Was he dreaming that it was a cowled figure? What would any figure, whether cowled or just casually dressed, be doing in the boot of his car?
At that moment a car zipped past him on the road and disappeared off into the night, taking its oasis of light with it. He thought with longing of the warm,

leather-upholstered, climate-controlled comfort of his own car abandoned on the road behind him, and then a sudden extraordinary thought struck him.
Was there any way he could hitch a lift? Could anyone actually see him? How would anyone react if they could? Well, there was only one way to find out.
He heard another car coming up in the distance behind him and turned to face it. The twin pools of hazy lights approached through the mist and Gordon gritted his phantom teeth and stuck his thumb out at them.
The car swept by regardless. Nothing.
Angrily he made an indistinct V sign at the receding red rear lights, and realised, looking straight through his own upraised arm, that he wasnât at his most visible at the moment. Was there perhaps some effort of will he could make to render himself more visible when he wanted to? He screwed up his eyes in concentration, then realised that he would need to have his eyes open in order to judge the results. He tried again, forcing his mind as hard as he could, but the results were unsatisfactory.
Though it did seem to make some kind of rudimentary, glowing difference, he couldnât sustain it, and it faded almost immediately, however much he piled on the mental pressure. He would have to judge the timing very carefully if he was going to make his presence felt, or at least seen.
Another car approached from behind, travelling fast. He turned again, stuck his thumb out, waited till the moment was right and willed himself visible.
The car swerved slightly, and then carried on its way, only a little more slowly. Well, that was something. What else could he do? He would go and stand under a lamppost for a start, and he would practise. The next car he would get for sure.

CHAPTER 12
â...so if youâd like to leave a message, Iâll get back to you as soon as possible. Maybe.â
Beep.
âShit. Damn. Hold on a minute. Blast. Look... er...â
Click.
Richard pushed the phone back into its cradle and slammed his car into reverse for twenty yards to have another look at the signpost by the road junction heâd just sped past in the mist. He had extracted himself from the Cambridge one-way system by the usual method, which involved going round and round it faster and faster until he achieved a sort of escape velocity and flew off at a tangent in a random direction, which he was now trying to identify and correct for.
Arriving back at the junction he tried to correlate the information on the signpost with the information on the map. But it couldnât be done. The road junction was quite deliberately sitting on a page divide on the map, and the signpost was revolving maliciously in the wind. Instinct told him that he was heading in the wrong direction, but he didnât want to go back the way heâd come for fear of getting sucked back into the gravitational whirlpool of Cambridgeâs traffic system.
He turned left, therefore, in the hope of finding better fortune in that direction, but after a while lost his nerve and turned a speculative right, and then chanced another exploratory left and after a few more such manoeuvres was thoroughly lost.
He swore to himself and turned up the heating in the car. If he had been concentrating on where he was going rather than trying to navigate and telephone at the same time, he told himself, he would at least know where he was now. He didnât actually like having a telephone in his car, he found it a bother and an intrusion. But Gordon had insisted and indeed had paid for it.

He sighed in exasperation, backed up the black Saab and turned around again. As he did so he nearly ran into someone lugging a body into a field. At least that was what it looked like for a second to his overwrought brain, but in fact it was probably a local farmer with a sackful of something nutritious, though what he was doing with it on a night like this was anyoneâs guess. As his headlights swung around again, they caught for a moment a silhouette of the figure trudging off across the field with the sack on his back.
âRather him than me,â thought Richard grimly, and drove off again.
After a few minutes he reached a junction with what looked a little more like a main road, nearly turned right down it, but then turned left instead. There was no signpost.
He poked at the buttons on his phone again. â...get back to you as soon as possible. Maybe.â Beep.
âSusan, itâs Richard. Where do I start? What a mess. Look Iâm sorry, sorry, sorry. I screwed up very badly, and itâs all my fault. And look, whatever it takes to make up for it, Iâll do it, solemn promise...â
He had a slight feeling that this wasnât the right tone to adopt with an answering machine, but he carried straight on.
âHonestly, we can go away, take a holiday for a week, or even just this weekend if you like. Really, this weekend. Weâll go somewhere sunny. Doesnât matter how much pressure Gordon tries to put on me, and you know the sort of pressure he can muster, he is your brother, after all. Iâll just... er, actually, it might have to be next weekend. Damn, damn, damn. Itâs just that I really have promised to get, no, look, it doesnât matter. Weâll just do it. I donât care about getting Anthem finished for Comdex. Itâs not the end of the world. Weâll just go. Gordon will just have to take a running jump -- Gaaarghhhh!â

Richard swerved wildly to avoid the spectre of Gordon Way which suddenly loomed in his headlights and took a running jump at him.
He slammed on the brakes, started to skid, tried to remember what it was you were supposed to do when you found yourself skidding, he knew heâd seen it on some television programme about driving heâd seen ages ago, what was the programme? God, he couldnât even remember the title of the programme, let alone -- oh yes, theyâd said you mustnât slam on the brakes. That was it. The world swung sickeningly around him with slow and appalling force as the car slewed across the road, spun, thudded against the grass verge, then slithered and rocked itself to a halt, facing the wrong way. He collapsed, panting, against the steering wheel.
He picked up the phone from where heâd dropped it. âSusan,â he gasped, âIâll get back to you,â and hung up. He raised his eyes.
Standing full in the glare of his headlights was the spectral figure of Gordon Way staring straight in through the windscreen with ghastly horror in its eyes, slowly raising its hand and pointing at him.
He wasnât sure how long he just sat there. The apparition had melted from view in a few seconds, but Richard simply sat, shaking, probably for not more than a minute, until a sudden squeal of brakes and glare of lights roused him.
He shook his head. He was, he realised, stopped in the road facing the wrong way. The car that had just screeched to an abrupt halt almost bumper to bumper with him was a police car. He took two or three deep breaths and then, stiff and trembling, he climbed out and stood up to face the officer who was walking slowly towards him, silhouetted in the police carâs headlights.
The officer looked him up and down.
âEr, Iâm sorry, officer,â said Richard, with as much calmness as he could

wrench into his voice. âI, er, skidded. The roads are slippery and I, er... skidded. I spun round. As you see, I, Iâm facing the wrong way.â He gestured at his car to indicate the way it was facing.
âLike to tell me why it was you skidded then, exactly, sir?â The police officer was looking him straight in the eye while pulling out a notebook.
âWell, as I said,â explained Richard, âthe roads are slippery because of the mist, and, well, to be perfectly honest,â he suddenly found himself saying, in spite of all his attempts to stop himself, âI was just driving along and I suddenly imagined that I saw my employer throwing himself in front of my car.â
The officer gazed at him levelly.
âGuilt complex, officer,â added Richard with a twitch of a smile, âyou know how it is. I was contemplating taking the weekend off.â
The police officer seemed to hesitate, balanced on a knife edge between sympathy and suspicion. His eyes narrowed a little but didnât waver.
âBeen drinking, sir?â
âYes,â said Richard, with a quick sigh, âbut very little. Two glasses of wine max. Er... and a small glass of port. Absolute max. It was really just a lapse of concentration. Iâm fine now.â
âName?â
Richard gave him his name and address. The policeman wrote it all down carefully and neatly in his book, then peered at the car registration number and wrote that down too.
âAnd who is your employer then, sir?â âHis name is Way. Gordon Way.â

âOh,â said the policemanraising his eyebrows, âthe computer gentleman.â
âEr, yes, thatâs right.I design software forthe company. WayForward Technologies II.â
âWeâve got one of your computers down the station,â said the policeman. âBuggered if I can get it to work.â
âOh,â said Richard wearily, âwhich model do you have?â âI think itâs called a Quark II.â
âOh, well thatâs simple,â said Richard with relief. âIt doesnât work. Never has done. The thing is a heap of shit.â
âFunny thing, sir, thatâswhat Iâve alwayssaid,â said the policeman. âSome of the other lads donât agree.â
âWell, youâre absolutely right, officer. The thing is hopeless. Itâs the major reason the original company went bust. I suggest you use it as a big paperweight.â
âWell, I wouldnât like to do that, sir,â the policeman persisted. âThe door would keep blowing open.â
âWhat do you mean, officer?â asked Richard.
âI use it to keep the door closed, sir. Nasty draughts down our station this time of year. In the summer, of course, we beat suspects round the head with it.â
He flipped his book closed and prodded it into his pocket.
âMy advice to you, sir, is to go nice and easy on the way back. Lock up the car and spend the weekend getting completely pissed. I find itâs the only way. Mind how you go now.â

He returned to his car, wound down the window, and watched Richard manoeuvre his car around and drive off into the night before heading off himself.
Richard took a deep breath, drove calmly back to London, let himself calmly into his flat, clambered calmly over the sofa, sat down, poured himself a stiff brandy and began seriously to shake.
There were three things he was shaking about.
There was the simple physical shock of his near-accident, which is the sort of thing that always churns you up a lot more than you expect. The body floods itself with adrenaline, which then hangs around your system turning sour.
Then there was the cause of the skid -- the extraordinary apparition of Gordon throwing himself in front of his car at that moment. Boy oh boy. Richard took a mouthful of brandy and gargled with it. He put the glass down.
It was well known that Gordon was one of the worldâs richest natural resources of guilt pressure, and that he could deliver a ton on your doorstep fresh every morning, but Richard hadnât realised he had let it get to him to such an unholy degree.
He took up his glass again, went upstairs and pushed open the door to his workroom, which involved shifting a stack of BYTE magazines that had toppled against it. He pushed them away with his foot and walked to the end of the large room. A lot of glass at this end let in views over a large part of north London, from which the mist was now clearing. St Paulâs glowed in the dark distance and he stared at it for a moment or two but it didnât do anything special. After the events of the evening he found this came as a pleasant surprise.
At the other end of the room were a couple of long tables smothered in, at the last count, six Macintosh computers. In the middle was the Mac II on which a red wire-frame model of his sofa was lazily revolving within a blue wire-frame model of his narrow staircase, complete with banister rail, radiator and fuse-box details, and of course the awkward turn halfway up.

The sofa would start out spinning in one direction,hit an obstruction, twist itself in another plane, hit another obstruction, revolve round a third axis until it was stopped again, then cycle through the moves again in a different order. You didnât have to watch the sequence for very long before you saw it repeat itself.
The sofa was clearly stuck.
Three other Macs were connected up via long tangles of cable to an untidy agglomeration of synthesisers -- an Emulator II+ HD sampler, a rack of TX modules, a Prophet VS, a Roland JX 10, a Korg DW8000, an Octapad, a left- handed Synth-Axe MIDI guitar controller, and even an old drum machine stacked up and gathering dust in the corner -- pretty much the works. There was also a small and rarely used cassette tape recorder: all the music was stored in sequencer files on the computers rather than on tape.
He dumped himself into a seat in front of one of the Macs to see what, if anything, it was doing. It was displaying an âUntitledâ Excel spreadsheet and he wondered why.
He saved it and looked to see if heâd left himself any notes and quickly discovered that the spreadsheet contained some of the data he had previously downloaded after searching the World Reporter and Knowledge on-line databases for facts about swallows.
He now had figures which detailed their migratory habits, their wing shapes, their aerodynamic profile and turbulence characteristics, and some sort of rudimentary figures concerning the patterns that a flock would adopt in flight, but as yet he had only the faintest idea as to how he was going to synthesise them all together.
Because he was too tired to think particularly constructively tonight he savagely selected and copied a whole swathe of figures from the spreadsheet at random, pasted them into his own conversion program, which scaled and filtered and manipulated the figures according to his ownexperimentalalgorithms,loadedtheconvertedfile into Performer, a

powerful sequencer program, and played the result through random MIDI channels to whichever synthesisers happened to be on at the moment.
The result was a short burst of the most hideous cacophony, and he stopped it.
He ran the conversion program again, this time instructing it to force-map the pitch values into G minor. This was a utility he was determined in the end to get rid of because he regarded it as cheating. If there was any basis to his firmly held belief that the rhythms and harmonies of music which he found most satisfying could be found in, or at least derived from, the rhythms and harmonies of naturally occurring phenomena, then satisfying forms of modality and intonation should emerge naturally as well, rather than being forced.
For the moment, though, he forced it.
The result was a short burst of the most hideous cacophony in G minor. So much for random shortcuts.
The first task was a relatively simple one, which would be simply to plot the waveform described by the tip of a swallowâs wing as it flies, then synthesise that waveform. That way he would end up with a single note, which would be a good start, and it shouldnât take more than the weekend to do.
Except, of course, that he didnât have a weekend available to do it in because he had somehow to get Version 2 of Anthem out of the door sometime during the course of the next year, or âmonthâ as Gordon called it.
Which brought Richard inexorably to the third thing he was shaking about.
There was absolutely no way that he could take the time off this weekend or next to fulfil the promise he had made to Susanâs telephone-answering machine. And that, if this eveningâs dÃ©bacle had not already done so, would surely spell the final end.
But that was it. The thing was done. There is nothing you can do about a

message on someone elseâs answering machine other than let events take their course. It was done. It was irrevocable.
An odd thought suddenly struck him.
It took him by considerable surprise, but he couldnât really see what was wrong with it.
CHAPTER 13
A pair of binoculars scanning the London night skyline, idly, curious, snooping. A little look here, a little look there, just seeing whatâs going on, anything interesting, anything useful.
The binoculars settle on the back of one particular house, attracted by a slight movement. One of those large late-Victorian villas, probably flats now. Lots of black iron drainpipes. Green rubber dustbins. But dark. No, nothing.
The binoculars are just moving onwards when another slight movement catches in the moonlight. The binoculars refocus very slightly, trying to find a detail, a hard edge, a slight contrast in the darkness. The mist has lifted now, and the darkness glistens. They refocus a very, very little more.
There it is. Something, definitely. Only this time a little higher up, maybe a foot or so, maybe a yard. The binoculars settle and relax - - steady, trying for the edge, trying for the detail. There. The binoculars settle again -- they have found their mark, straddled between a windowsill and a drainpipe.
It is a dark figure, splayed against the wall, looking down, looking for a new foothold, looking upwards,looking for a ledge. The binoculars peer intently.
The figure is that of a tall, thin man. His clothes are right for the job, dark trousers, dark sweater, but his movements are awkward and angular. Nervous. Interesting. The binocularswait and consider, consider and judge.

The man is clearly a rank amateur.
Look at his fumbling. Look at his ineptitude. His feet slip on the drainpipe, his hands canât reach the ledge. He nearly falls. He waits to catch his breath. For a moment he starts to climb back down again, but seems to find that even tougher going.
He lunges again for the ledge and this time catches it. His foot shoots out to steady himself and nearly misses the pipe. Could have been very nasty, very nasty indeed.
But now the way is easier and progress is better. He crosses to another pipe, reaches a third-floor window ledge, flirts briefly with death as he crawls painfully on to it, and makes the cardinal error and looks down. He sways briefly and sits back heavily. He shades his eyes and peers inside to check that the room is dark, and sets about getting the window open.
One of the things that distinguish the amateur from the professional is that this is the point when the amateur thinks it would have been a good idea to bring along something to prise the window open with. Luckily for this amateur the householder is an amateur too, and the sash window slides grudgingly up. The climber crawls, with some relief, inside.
He should be locked up for his own protection, think the binoculars. A hand starts to reach for the phone. At the window a face looks back out and for a moment is caught in the moonlight, then it ducks back inside to carry on with its business.
The hand stays hovering over the phone for a moment or two, while the binoculars wait and consider, consider and judge. The hand reaches instead for the A-Z street map of London.
There is a long studious pause, a little more intent binocular work, and then the hand reaches for the phone again, lifts it and dials.

CHAPTER 14
Susanâs flat was small but spacious, which was a trick, reflected Richard tensely as he turned on the light, that only women seemed able to pull off.
It wasnât that observation which made him tense, of course -- heâd thought it before, many times. Every time heâd been in her flat, in fact. It always struck him, usually because he had just come from his own flat, which was four times the size and cramped. Heâd just come from his own flat this time, only via a rather eccentric route, and it was this that made his usual observation unusually tense.
Despite the chill of the night he was sweating.
He looked back out of the window, turned and tiptoed across the room towards where the telephone and the answering machine stood on their own small table.
There was no point, he told himself, in tiptoeing. Susan wasnât in. He would be extremely interested to know where she was, in fact -- just as she, he told himself, had probably been extremely interested in knowing where he had been at the beginning of the evening.
He realised he was still tiptoeing. He hit his leg to make himself stop doing it, but carried on doing it none the less.
Climbing up the outside wall had been terrifying.
He wiped his forehead with the arm of his oldest and greasiest sweater. There had been a nasty moment when his life had flashed before his eyes but he had been too preoccupied with falling and had missed all the good bits. Most of the good bits had involved Susan, he realised. Susan or computers. Never Susan and computers -- those had largely been the bad bits. Which was why he was here, he told himself. He seemed to need convincing, and told himself again.

He looked at his watch. Eleven forty-five.
It occurred to him he had better go and wash his wet and dirty hands before he touched anything. It wasnât the police he was worried about, but Susanâs terrifying cleaner. She would know.
He went into the bathroom, turned on the light switch, wiped it, and then stared at his own startled face in the bright neon-lit mirror as he ran the water over his hands. For a moment he thought of the dancing, warm candlelight of the Coleridge Dinner, and the images of it welled up out of the dim and distant past of the earlier part of the evening. Life had seemed easy then, and carefree. The wine, the conversation, simple conjuring tricks. He pictured the round pale face of Sarah, pop-eyed with wonder. He washed his own face.
He thought:
â...Beware! Beware!
His flashing eyes, his floating hair!â
He brushed his own hair. He thought, too, of the pictures hanging high in the darkness above their heads. He cleaned his teeth. The low buzz of the neon light snapped him back to the present and he suddenly remembered with appalled shock that he was here in his capacity as burglar.
Something made him look himself directly in the face in the mirror, then he shook his head, trying to clear it.
When would Susan be back? That, of course, would depend on what she was doing. He quickly wiped his hands and made his way back to the answering machine. He prodded at the buttons and his conscience prodded back at him. The tape wound back for what seemed to be an interminable time, and he realised with a jolt that it was probably because Gordon had been in full flood.
He had forgotten, of course, that there would be messages on the tape other than his own, and listening to other peopleâs phone messages was tantamount to

opening their mail.
He explained to himself once again that all he was trying to do was to undo a mistake he had made before it caused any irrevocable damage. He would just play the tiniest snippets till he found his own voice. That wouldnât be too bad, he wouldnât even be able to distinguish what was being said.
He groaned inwardly, gritted his teeth and stabbed at the Play button so roughly that he missed it and ejected the cassette by mistake. He put it back in and pushed the Play button more carefully.
Beep.
âOh, Susan, hi, itâs Gordon,â said the answering machine. âIâm just on my way to the cottage. Itâs, er...â He wound on for a couple of seconds. â...need to know that Richard is on the case. I mean really on...â Richard set his mouth grimly and stabbed at the Fast Forward again. He really hated the fact that Gordon tried to put pressure on him via Susan, which Gordon always stoutly denied he did. Richard couldnât blame Susan for getting exasperated about his work sometimes if this sort of thing was going on.âClick.
â...Response. Make a note to Susan would you please, to get an âArmed Responseâ sign made up with a sharp spike on the bottom at the right height for rabbits to see.â
âWhat?â muttered Richard to himself, and his finger hesitated for a second over the Fast Forward button. He had a feeling that Gordon desperately wanted to be like Howard Hughes, and if he could never hope to be remotely as rich, he could at least try to be twice as eccentric. An act. A palpable act.
âThatâs secretary Susan at the office, notyou, of course,â continued Gordonâs voice on the answering machine. âWhere was I? Oh yes. Richard and Anthem 2.00. Susan, that thing has got to be in beta testing in two...â Richard stabbed at the Fast Forward, tight-lipped.
â...point is that thereâs only one person whoâs really in a position to know if heâs getting the important work done, or if heâs just dreaming, and that one

person...â He stabbed angrily again. He had promised himself he wouldnât listen to any of it and now here he was getting angry at what he was hearing. He should really just stop this. Well, just one more try.
When he listened again he just got music. Odd. He wound forward again, and still got music. Why would someone be phoning to play music to an answering machine? he wondered.
The phone rang. He stopped the tape and answered it, then almost dropped the phone like an electric eel as he realised what he was doing. Hardly daring to breathe, he held the telephone to his ear.
âRule One in housebreaking,â said a voice. âNever answer the telephone when youâre in the middle of a job. Who are you supposed to be, for heavenâs sake?â
Richard froze. It was a moment or two before he could find where he had put his voice.
âWho is this?â he demanded at last in a whisper.
âRule Two,â continued the voice. âPreparation. Bring the right tools. Bring gloves. Try to have the faintest glimmering of an idea of what youâre about before you start dangling from window ledges in the middle of the night.
âRule Three. Never forget Rule Two.â âWho is this?â exclaimed Richard again.
The voice was unperturbed. âNeighbourhood Watch,â it said. âIf you just look out of the back window youâll see...â
Trailing the phone, Richard hurried over to the window and looked out. A distant flash startled him.
âRule Four. Never stand where you can be photographed.

âRule Five... Are you listening to me, MacDuff?â
âWhat? Yes...â said Richard in bewilderment. âHow do you know me?â âRule Five. Never admit to your name.â
Richard stood silent, breathing hard.
âI run a little course,â said the voice, âif youâre interested...â
Richard said nothing.
âYouâre learning,âcontinued the voice,âslowly,but youâre learning. If you were learning fast you would have put the phone down by now, of course. But youâre curious -- and incompetent -- and so you donât. I donât run a course for novice burglars as it happens, tempting though the idea is. Iâm sure there would be grants available. If we have to have them they may as well be trained.
âHowever, if I did run such a course I would allow you to enrol for free, because I too am curious. Curious to know why Mr Richard MacDuff who, I am given to understand, is now a wealthy young man, something in the computer industry, I believe, should suddenly be needing to resort to housebreaking.â
âWho -- ?â
âSo I do a little research, phone Directory Enquiries and discover that the flat into which he is breaking is that of a Miss S. Way. I know that Mr Richard MacDuffâs employer is the famous Mr G. Way and I wonder if they can by any chance be related.â
âWho -- ?â
âYou are speaking with Svlad, commonly known as âDirkâ Cjelli, currently trading under the name of Gently for reasons which it would be otiose, at this moment, to rehearse. I bid you good evening. If you wish to know more I will be at the Pizza Express in Upper Street in ten minutes. Bring some money.â

âDirk?â exclaimed Richard. âYou... Are you trying to blackmail me?ââNo, you fool, for the pizzas.â There was a click and Dirk Gently rang off.
Richard stood transfixed for a moment or two, wiped his forehead again, and gently replaced the phone as if it were an injured hamster. His brain began to buzz gently and suck its thumb. Lots of little synapses deep inside his cerebral cortex all joined hands and started dancing around and singing nursery rhymes. He shook his head to try and make them stop, and quickly sat down at the answering machine again.
He fought with himself over whether or not he was going to push the Play button again, and then did so anyway before he had made up his mind. Hardly fourseconds oflight orchestral music had oozed soothingly past when there came the sound of a key scratching in the lock out in the hallway.
In panic Richard thumped the Eject button, popped the cassette out, rammed it into his jeans pocket and replaced it from the pile of fresh cassettes that lay next to the machine. There was a similar pile next to his own machine at home. Susan at the office provided them -- poor, long-suffering Susan at the office. He must remember to feel sympathy for her in the morning, when he had the time and concentration for it.Suddenly, without even noticing himself doing it, he changed his mind. In a flash he popped the substitute cassette out of the machine again, replaced the one he had stolen, rammed down the rewind button and made a lunge for the sofa where, with two seconds to go before the door opened, he tried to arrange himself into a nonchalant and winning posture. On an impulse he stuck his left hand up behind his back where it might come in useful.
He was just trying to arrange his features into an expression composed inequalparts of contrition, cheerfulness and sexual allurement when the door opened and in walked Michael Wenton-Weakes.
Everything stopped.
Outside, the wind ceased. Owls halted in mid-flight. Well, maybe they did, maybe they didnât, certainly the central heating chose that moment to shut

down, unable perhaps to cope with the supernatural chill that suddenly whipped through the room.
âWhat are you doing here, Wednesday?â demanded Richard. He rose from the sofa as if levitated with anger.
Michael Wenton-Weakes was a large sad-faced man known by some people as Michael Wednesday-Week, because that was when he usually promised to have things done by. He was dressed in a suit that had been superbly well tailored when his father, the late Lord Magna, had bought it forty years previously.
Michael Wenton-Weakes came very high on the small but select list of people whom Richard thoroughly disliked.
He disliked him because he found the idea of someone who was not only privileged, but was also sorry for himself because he thought the world didnât really understand the problems of privileged people, deeply obnoxious. Michael, on the other hand, disliked Richard for the fairly simple reason that Richard disliked him and made no secret of it.
Michael gave a slow and lugubrious look back out into the hallway as Susan walked through. She stopped when she saw Richard. She put down her handbag, unwound her scarf, unbuttoned her coat, slipped it off, handed it to Michael, walked over to Richard and smacked him in the face.
âIâve been saving that up all evening,â she said furiously. âAnd donât try and pretend thatâs a bunch of flowers youâve forgotten to bring which youâre hiding behind your back. You tried that gag last time.â She turned and stalked off.
âItâs a box of chocolates I forgot this time,â said Richard glumly and held out his empty hand to her retreating back. âI climbed up the entire outside wall without them. Did I feel a fool when I got in.â
âNot very funny,â said Susan. She swept into the kitchen and sounded as if she was grinding coffee with her bare hands. For someone who always looked so neat and sweet and delicate she packed a hell of a temper.

âItâs true,â said Richard, ignoring Michael completely. âI nearly killed myself.â
âIâm not going to rise to that,â said Susan from within the kitchen. âIf you want something big and sharp thrown at you why donât you come in here and be funny?â
âI suppose it would be pointless saying Iâm sorry at this point,â Richard called out.
âYou bet,â said Susan, sweeping back out of the kitchen again. She looked at him with her eyes flashing, and actually stamped her foot.
âHonestly, Richard,â she said, âI suppose youâre going to say you forgot again. How can you have the gall to stand there with two arms, two legs and a head as if youâre a human being? This is behaviour that a bout of amoebic dysentery would be ashamed of. I bet that even the very lowest form of dysentery amoeba shows up to take its girlfriend out for a quick trot around the stomach lining once in a while. Well, I hope you had a lousy evening.â
âI did,â said Richard. âYou wouldnât have liked it. There was a horse in the bathroom, and you know how you hate that sort of thing.â
âOh, Michael,â said Susan brusquely, âdonât just stand there like a sinking pudding. Thank you very much for dinner and the concert, you were very sweet and I did enjoy listening to your troubles all evening because they were such a nice change from mine. But I think it would be best if I just found your book and pushed you out. Iâve got some serious jumping up and down and ranting to do, and I know how it upsets your delicate sensibilities.â
She retrieved her coat from him and hung it up. While he had been holding it he had seemed entirely taken up with this task and oblivious to anything else. Without it he seemed a little lost and naked and was forced to stir himself back into life. He turned his big heavy eyes back on Richard.
âRichard,â he said, âI, er, read your piece in... in Fathom. On Music and, er...â

âFractal Landscapes,â said Richard shortly. He didnât want to talk to Michael, and he certainlydidnât want to get drawn into a conversation about Michaelâs wretched magazine. Or rather, the magazine that used to be Michaelâs.
That was the precise aspect of the conversation that Richard didnât want to get drawn into.
âEr, yes. Very interesting, of course,â said Michael in his silky, over-rounded voice. âMountain shapes and tree shapes and all sorts of things. Recycled algae.â
âRecursive algorithms.â
âYes, of course. Very interesting. But so wrong, so terribly wrong. For the magazine, I mean. It is, after all, an arts review. I would never have allowed such a thing, of course. Ross has utterly ruined it. Utterly. Heâll have to go. Have to. He has no sensibilities and heâs a thief.â
âHeâs not a thief, Wednesday, thatâs absolutely absurd,â snapped Richard, instantly getting drawn into it in spite of his resolution not to. âHe had nothing to do with your getting the push whatsoever. That was your own silly fault, and you...â
There was a sharp intake of breath.
âRichard,â said Michael in his softest, quietest voice -- arguing with him was like getting tangled in parachute silk -- âI think you do not understand how important...â
âMichael,â said Susan gently but firmly, holding open the door. Michael Wenton-Weakes nodded faintly and seemed to deflate.
âYour book,â Susan added, holding out to him a small and elderly volume on the ecclesiastical architecture of Kent. He took it, murmured some slight thanks, looked about him for a moment as if heâd suddenly realised something rather

odd, then gathered himself together, nodded farewell and left.
Richard didnât appreciate quite how tense he had become till Michael left and he was suddenly able to relax. Heâd always resented the indulgent soft spot that Susan had for Michael even if she did try to disguise it by being terribly rude to him all the time. Perhaps even because of that.
âSusan, what can I say...?â he started lamely.
âYou could say âOuchâ for a start. You didnât even give me that satisfaction when I hit you, and I thought I did it rather hard. God, itâs freezing in here. Whatâs that window doing wide open?â
She went over to shut it.
âI told you. Thatâs how I got in,â said Richard.
He sounded sufficiently as if he meant it to make her look round at him in surprise.
âReally,â he said. âLike in the chocolate ads, only I forgot the box of chocolates...â He shrugged sheepishly.
She stared at him in amazement.
âWhat on earth possessed you to do that?â she said. She stuck her head out of the window and looked down. âYou could have got killed,â she said, turning back to him.
âWell, er, yes...â he said. âIt just seemed the only way to... I donât know.â He rallied himself. âYou took your key back remember?â
âYes. I got fed up with you coming and raiding my larder when you couldnât be bothered to do your own shopping. Richard, you really climbed up this wall?â
âWell, I wanted to be here when you got in.â

She shook her head in bewilderment. âIt would have been a great deal better if youâd been here when I went out. Is that why youâre wearing those filthy old clothes?â
âYes. You donât think I went to dinner at St Ceddâs like this?â
âWell, I no longer know what you consider to be rational behaviour.â She sighed and fished about in a small drawer. âHere,â she said, âif itâs going to save your life,â and handed him a couple of keys on a ring. âIâm too tired to be angry anymore. An evening of being lobbied by Michael has taken it out of me.â
âWell, Iâll never understand why you put up with him,â said Richard, going to fetch the coffee.
âI know you donât like him, but heâs very sweet and can be charming in his sad kind of way. Usually itâs very relaxing to be with someone whoâs so self- absorbed, because it doesnât make any demands on you. But heâs obsessed with the idea that I can do something about his magazine. I canât, of course. Life doesnât work like that. I do feel sorry for him, though.â
âI donât. Heâs had it very, very easy all his life. He still has it very, very easy. Heâs just had his toy taken away from him thatâs all. Itâs hardly unjust, is it?â
âItâs not a matter of whether itâs just or not. I feel sorry for him because heâs unhappy.â
âWell, of course heâs unhappy. Al Ross has turned Fathom into a really
sharp, intelligent magazine that everyone suddenly wants to read. It was just a bumbling shambles before. Its only real function was to let Michael have lunch and toady about with whoever he liked on the pretext that maybe they might like to write a little something. He hardly ever got an actual issue out. The whole thing was a sham. He pampered himself with it. I really donât find that charming or engaging. Iâm sorry, Iâm going on about it and I didnât mean to.â

Susan shrugged uneasily.
âI think you overreact,â she said, âthough I think I will have to steer clear of him if heâs going to keep on at me to do something I simply canât do. Itâs too exhausting. Anyway, listen, Iâm glad you had a lousy evening. I want to talk about what we were going to do this weekend.â
âAh,â said Richard, âwell...â
âOh, Iâd better just check the messages first.â
She walked past him to the telephone-answering machine, played the first few seconds of Gordonâs message and then suddenly ejected the cassette.
âI canât be bothered,â she said, giving it to him. âCould you just give this straight to Susan at the office tomorrow? Save her a trip. If thereâs anything important on it she can tell me.â
Richard blinked, said, âEr, yes,â and pocketed the tape, tingling with the shock of the reprieve.
âAnyway, the weekend --â said Susan, sitting down on the sofa. Richard wiped his hand over his brow. âSusan, I...â
âIâm afraid Iâve got to work. Nicolaâs sick and Iâm going to have to dep for her at the Wigmore on Friday week. Thereâs some Vivaldi and some Mozart I donât know too well, so that means a lot of extra practice this weekend, Iâm afraid. Sorry.â
âWell, in fact,â said Richard, âI have to work as well.â He sat down by her.
âI know. Gordon keeps on at me to nag you. I wish he wouldnât. Itâs none of my business and it puts me in an invidious position. Iâm tired of being pressurised by people, Richard. At least you donât do that.â
She took a sip of her coffee.

âBut Iâm sure,â she added, âthat thereâs some kind of grey area between being pressurised and being completely forgotten about that Iâd quite like to explore. Give me a hug.â
He hugged her, feeling that he was monstrously and unworthily lucky. An hour later he let himself out and discovered that the Pizza Express was closed.
Meanwhile, Michael Wenton-Weakes made his way back to his home in Chelsea. As he sat in the back of the taxi he watched the streets with a blank stare and tapped his fingers lightly against the window in a slow thoughtful rhythm.
Rap tap tap a rap tap a rap a tap.
He was one of those dangerous people who are soft, squidgy and cowlike provided they have what they want. And because he had always had what he wanted, and had seemed easily pleased with it, it had never occurred to
anybody that he was anything other than soft, squidgy and cowlike. You would have to push through a lot of soft squidgy bits in order to find a bit that didnât give when you pushed it. That was the bit that all the soft squidgy bits were there to protect.
Michael Wenton-Weakes was the younger son of Lord Magna, publisher, newspaper owner and over-indulgent father, under whose protective umbrella it had pleased Michael to run his own little magazine at a magnificent loss.Lord Magna had presided over the gradual but dignifiedandwell-respecteddecline of the publishingempire originally founded by his father, the first Lord Magna.
Michael continued to tap his knuckles lightly on the glass.
A rap tap a rap a tap.
He remembered the appalling, terrible day when his father had electrocuted himself changing a plug, and his mother, his mother, took over the business. Not only took it over but started running it with completely unexpected verve

and determination. She examined the company with a very sharp eye as to how it was being run, or walked, as she put it, and eventually even got around to looking at the accounts of Michaelâs magazine.
Tap tap tap.
Now Michael knew just enough about the business side of things to know what the figures ought to be, and he had simply assured his father that that was indeed what they were.
âCanât allow this job just to be a sinecure, you must see that, old fellow, you have to pay your way or how would it look, how would it be?â his father used to say, and Michael would nod seriously, and start thinking up the figures for next month, or whenever it was he would next manage to get an issue out.
His mother, on the other hand, was not so indulgent. Not by a lorryload.
Michael usually referred to his mother as an old battleaxe, but if she was fairly to be compared to a battleaxe it would only be to an exquisitely crafted, beautifully balanced battleaxe, with an elegant minimum of fine engraving which stopped just short of its gleaming razored edge. One swipe from such an instrument and you wouldnât even know youâd been hit until you tried to look at your watch a bit later and discovered that your arm wasnât on.
She had been waiting patiently -- or at least with the appearance of patience -- in the wings all this time, being the devoted wife, the doting but strict mother. Now someone had taken her -- to switch metaphors for a moment -- out of her scabbard and everyone was running for cover.
Including Michael.
It was her firm belief that Michael, whom she quietly adored, had been spoiled in the fullest and worst sense of the word, and she was determined, at this late stage, to stop it.
It didnât take her more than a few minutes to see that he had been simply making up the figures every month, and that the magazine was

haemorrhaging money as Michael toyed with it, all the time running up huge lunch bills, taxi accounts and staff costs that he would playfully set against fictitious taxes. The whole thing had simply got lost somewhere in the gargantuan accounts of Magna House.
She had then summoned Michael to see her.
Tap tap a rap a tappa.
âHow do you want me to treat you,â she said, âas my son or as the editor of one of my magazines? Iâm happy to do either.â
âYour magazines? Well, I am your son, but I donât see...â
âRight. Michael, I want you to look at these figures,â she said briskly, handing over a sheet of computer printout. âThe ones on the left show the actual incomings and outgoings of Fathom, the ones on the right are your own figures. Does anything strike you about them?â
âMother, I can explain, I --â
âGood,â said Lady Magna sweetly, âIâm very glad of that.â
She took the piece of paper back. âNow. Do you have any views on how the magazine should best be run in the future?â
âYes, absolutely. Very strong ones. I --â
âGood,â said Lady Magna, with a bright smile. âWell, thatâs all perfectly satisfactory, then.â
âDonât you want to hear -- ?â
âNo, thatâs all right, dear. Iâm just happy to know that you do have something to say on the matter to clear it all up. Iâm sure the new owner of Fathom will be glad to listen to whatever it is.â

âWhat?â said a stunned Michael. âYou mean youâre actually selling Fathom?â
âNo. I mean Iâve already sold it. Didnât get much for it, Iâm afraid. One pound plus a promise that you would be retained as editor for the next three issues, and after that itâs at the new ownerâs discretion.â
Michael stared, pop-eyed.
âWell, come now,â said his mother reasonably, âwe could hardly continue under the present arrangement, could we? You always agreed with your father that the job should not be a sinecure for you. And since I would have a great deal of difficulty in either believing or resisting your stories, I thought I would hand the problem on to someone with whom you could have a more objective relationship. Now, I have another appointment, Michael.â
âWell, but... who have you sold it to?â spluttered Michael.
âGordon Way.â
âGordon Way! But for heavenâs sake, Mother, heâs --â
âHeâs very anxious to be seen to patronise the arts. And I think I do mean patronise. Iâm sure youâll get on splendidly, dear. Now, if you donât mind --â
Michael stood his ground.
âIâve never heard of anything so outrageous! I --â
âDo you know, thatâs exactly what Mr Way said when I showed him these figures and then demanded that you be kept on as editor for three issues.â
Michael huffed and puffed and went red and wagged his finger, but could think of nothing more to say. Except, âWhat difference would it have made to all this if Iâd said treat me as the editor of one of your magazines?â
âWhy, dear,â said Lady Magna with her sweetest smile, âI would have called you Mr Wenton-Weakes, of course. And I wouldnât now be telling you

straighten your tie,â she added, with a tiny little gesture under her chin.
Rap tap tap rap tap tap.
âNumber seventeen, was it, guv?â
âEr... what?â said Michael, shaking his head.
âIt was seventeen you said, was it?â said the cab driver, ââCause weâre âere.â
âOh. Oh, yes, thank you,â said Michael. He climbed out and fumbled in his pocket for some money.
âTap tap tap, eh?â
âWhat?â said Michael handing over the fare.
âTap tap tap,â said the cab driver, âall the bloody way here. Got something on your mind, eh, mate?â
âMind your own bloody business,â snapped Michael savagely.âIf you say so, mate. Just thought you might be going mad or something,â said the cabbie and drove off.
Michael let himself into his house and walked through the cold hall to the dining room, turned on the overhead light and poured himself a brandy from the decanter. He took off his coat, threw it across the large mahogany dining table and pulled a chair over to the window where he sat nursing his drink and his grievances.
Tap tap tap, he went on the window.
He had sullenly remained as editor for the stipulated three issues and was then, with little ceremony, let go. A new editor was found, a certain A. K. Ross, who was young, hungry and ambitious, and he quickly turned the magazineinto a resounding success. Michael, in the meantime, had been lost and naked. There was nothing else for him.

He tapped on the window again and looked, as he frequently did, at the small table lamp that stood on the sill. It was a rather ugly, ordinary little lamp, and the only thing about it that regularly transfixed hisattention was that this was the lamp thathad electrocuted his father, and this was where he had been sitting.
The old boy was such a fool with anything technical. Michael could just see him peering with profound concentration through his half moons and suckinghis moustache as he tried to unravelthearcane complexities of a thirteen-amp plug. He had, it seemed, plugged it back in the wall without first screwing the cover back on and then tried to change the fuse in situ. From this he received the shock which had stilled his already dicky heart.
Such a simple, simple error, thought Michael, such as anyone could have made, anyone, but the consequences of it were catastrophic. Utterly catastrophic. His fatherâs death, his own loss, the rise of the appalling Ross and his disastrously successful magazine and...
Tap tap tap.
He looked at the window, at his own reflection, and at the dark shadows of the bushes on the other side of it. He looked again at the lamp. This was the very object, this the very place, and the error was such a simple one. Simple to make, simple to prevent.
The only thing that separated him from that simple moment was the invisible barrier of the months that had passed in between.
A sudden, odd calm descended on him as if something inside him had suddenly been resolved.
Tap tap tap.
Fathom was his. It wasnât meant to be a success, it was his life. His life had been taken from him, and that demanded a response.

Tap tap tap crack.
He surprised himself by suddenly punching his hand through the window and cutting himself quite badly.
CHAPTER 15
Some of the less pleasant aspects of being dead were beginning to creep up on Gordon Way as he stood in front of his âcottageâ.
It was in fact a rather large house by anybody elseâs standards but he had always wanted to have a cottage in the country and so when the time came for him finally to buy one and he discovered that he had rather more money available than he had ever seriously believed he might own, he bought a large old rectory and called it a cottage in spite of its seven bedrooms and its four acres of dank Cambridgeshire land. This did little to endear him to people who only had cottages, but then if Gordon Way had allowed his actions to be governed by what endeared him to people he wouldnât have been Gordon Way.
He wasnât, of course, Gordon Way any longer. He was the ghost of Gordon Way.
In his pocket he had the ghosts of Gordon Wayâs keys.
It was this realisation that had stopped him for a moment in his invisible tracks. The idea of walking through walls frankly revolted him. It was something he had been trying strenuously to avoid all night. He had instead been fighting to grip and grapple with every object hetouched in order to render it, and thereby himself, substantial. To enter his house, his own house, by any means other than that of opening the front door and striding in in a proprietorial manner filled him with a hurtling sense of loss.
He wished, as he stared at it, that the house was not such an extreme example of Victorian Gothic, and that the moonlight didnât play so coldly on its

narrow gabled windows and its forbidding turrets. He had joked, stupidly, when he bought it that it looked as if it ought to be haunted, not realising that one day it would be -- or by whom.
A chill of the spirit gripped him as he made his way silently up the driveway, lined by the looming shapes of yew trees that were far older than the rectory itself. It was a disturbing thought that anybody else might be scared walking up such a driveway on such a night for fear of meeting something such as him.
Behind a screen of yew trees off to his left stood the gloomy bulk of the old church, decaying now, only used in rotation with others in neighbouring villages and presided over by a vicar who was always breathless from bicycling there and dispirited by the few who were waiting for him when he arrived. Behind the steeple of the church hung the cold eye of the moon.
A glimpse of movement seemed suddenly to catch his eye, as if a figure had moved in the bushes near the house, but it was, he told himself, only his imagination, overwrought by the strain of being dead. What was there here that he could possibly be afraid of?
He continued onwards, around the angle of the wing of the rectory, towards the front door set deep within its gloomy porch wreathed in ivy. He was suddenly startled to realise that there was light coming from within the house. Electric light and also the dim flicker of firelight.
It was a moment or two before he realised that he was, of course, expected that night, though hardly in his present form. Mrs Bennett, the elderly housekeeper, would have been in to make the bed, light the fire and leave out a light supper for him.
The television, too, would be on, especially so that he could turn it off impatiently upon entering.
His footsteps failed to crunch on the gravel as he approached. Though he knew that he must fail at the door, he nevertheless could not but go there first, to try if he could open it, and only then, hidden within the shadows of the porch, would he close his eyes and let himself slip ashamedly through it.

He stepped up to the door and stopped. It was open.
Just half an inch, but it was open. His spirit fluttered in fearful surprise. How could it be open? Mrs Bennett was always so conscientious about such things. He stood uncertainly for a moment and then with difficulty exerted himself against the door. Under the little pressure he could bring to bear on it, it swung slowly and unwillingly open, its hinges groaning in protest. He stepped through and slipped along the stone-flagged hallway. A wide staircase led up into the darkness, but the doors that led off from the hallway all stood closed.
The nearest door led into the drawing room, in which the fire was burning, and from which he could hear the muted car chases of the late movie. He struggled futilely for a minute or two with its shiny brass door knob, but was forced in the end to admit a humiliating defeat, and with a sudden rage flung himself straight at the door -- and through it.
The room inside was a picture of pleasant domestic warmth. He staggered violently into it, and was unable to stop himself floating on through a small occasional table set with thick sandwiches and a Thermos flask of hot coffee, through a large overstuffed armchair, into the fire, through the thick hot brickwork and into the cold dark dining room beyond.
The connecting door back into the sitting room was also closed. Gordon fingereditnumbly and then, submitting himself to the inevitable, braced himself, and slid back through it, calmly, gently, noticing for the first time the rich internal grain of the wood.
The coziness of the room was almost too much for Gordon, and he wandered distractedly around it, unable to settle, letting the warm liveliness of the firelight play through him. Him it couldnât warm.
What, he wondered, were ghosts supposed to do all night?
He sat, uneasily, and watched the television. Soon, however, the car chases drifted peacefully to a close and there was nothing left but grey snow and

white noise, which he was unable to turn off.
He found heâd sunk too far into the chair and confused himself with bits of it as he pushed and pulled himself up. He tried to amuse himself by standing in the middle of a table, but it did little to alleviatea mood thatwas sliding inexorablyfrom despondency downwards.
Perhaps he would sleep. Perhaps.
He felt no tiredness or drowsiness, but just a deadly craving for oblivion. He passed back through the closed door and into the dark hallway, from which the wide heavy stairs led to the large gloomy bedrooms above.
Up these, emptily, he trod.
It was for nothing, he knew. If you cannot open the door to a bedroom you cannot sleep in its bed. He slid himself through the door and lifted himself on to the bed which he knew to be cold though he could not feel it. The moon seemed unable to leave him alone and shone full on him as he lay there wide- eyed and empty, unable now to remember what sleep was or how to do it.
The horror of hollowness lay on him, the horror of lying ceaselessly and forever awake at four oâclock in the morning.
He had nowhere to go, nothing to do when he got there, and no one he could go and wake up who wouldnât be utterly horrified to see him.
The worst moment had been when he had seen Richard on the road, Richardâs face frozen white in the windscreen. He saw again his face, and that of the pale figure next to him.
That had been the thing which had shaken out of him the lingering shred of warmth at the back of his mind which said that this was just a temporary problem. It seemed terrible in the night hours, but would be all right in the morning when he could see people and sort things out. He fingered the memory

of the moment in his mind and could not let it go.
He had seen Richard and Richard, he knew, had seen him. It was not going to be all right.
Usually when he felt this bad at night he popped downstairs to see what was in the fridge, so he went now. It would be more cheerful than this moonlit bedroom. He would hang around the kitchen going bump in the night.
He slid down -- and partially through -- the banisters, wafted through the kitchen door without a second thought and then devoted all his concentration and energy for about five minutes to getting the light switch on.
That gave him a real sense of achievement and he determined to celebrate with a beer.
After a minute or two of repeatedly juggling and dropping a can of Fosters he gave it up. He had not the slightest conception of how he could manage to open a ring pull, and besides the stuff was all shaken up by now -- and what was he going to do with the stuff even if he did get it open?
He didnât have a body to keep it in. He hurled the can away from him and it scuttled off under a cupboard.
He began to notice something about himself, which was the way in which his ability to grasp things seemed to grow and fade in a slow rhythm, as did his visibility.
There was an irregularity in the rhythm, though, or perhaps it was just that sometimes the effects of it would be much more pronounced than at others. That, too, seemed to vary according to a slower rhythm. Just at that moment it seemed to him that his strength was on the increase.
In a sudden fever of activity he tried to see how many things in the kitchen he could move or use or somehow get to work.

He pulled open cupboards, he yanked out drawers, scattering cutlery on the floor. He got a brief whirr out of the food processor, he knocked over the electric coffee grinder without getting it to work, he turned on the gas on the cooker hob but then couldnât light it, he savaged a loaf of bread with a carving knife. He tried stuffing lumps of bread into his mouth, but they simply fell through his mouth to the floor. A mouse appeared, but scurried from the room, its coat electric with fear.
Eventually he stopped and sat at the kitchen table, emotionally exhausted but physically numb.
How, he wondered, would people react to his death? Who would be most sorry to know that he had gone?
For a while there would be shock, then sadness, then they would adjust, and he would be a fading memory as people got on with their own lives without him, thinking that he had gone on to wherever people go. That was a thought that filled him with the most icy dread.
He had not gone. He was still here.
He sat facing one cupboard that he hadnât managed to open yet because its handle was too stiff, and that annoyed him. He grappled awkwardly with a
tin of tomatoes, then went over again to the large cupboard and attacked the handle with the tin. The door flew open and his own missing bloodstained body fell horribly forward out of it.
Gordon hadnât realised up till this point that it was possible for a ghost to faint. He realised it now and did it.
He was woken a couple of hours later by the sound of his gas cooker exploding.

CHAPTER 16
The following morning Richard woke up twice.
The first time he assumed he had made a mistake and turned over for a fitful few minutes more. The second time he sat up with a jolt as the events of the previous night insisted themselves upon him.
He went downstairs and had a moody and unsettled breakfast, during which nothing went right. He burned the toast, spilled the coffee, and realised that though heâd meant to buy some more marmalade yesterday, he hadnât. He surveyed his feeble attempt at feeding himself and thought that maybe he could at least allow himself the time to take Susan out for an amazing meal tonight, to make up for last night.
If he could persuade her to come.
There was a restaurant that Gordon had been enthusing about at great length and recommending that they try. Gordon was pretty good on restaurants -- he certainly seemed to spend enough time in them. He sat and tapped his teeth with a pencil for a couple of minutes, and then went up to his workroom and lugged a telephone directory out from under a pile of computer magazines.
LâEsprit dâEscalier.
He phoned the restaurant and tried to book a table, but when he said when he wanted it for this seemed to cause a little amusement.
âAh, non, mâsieur,â said the maÃ®tre dâ, âI regret that it is impossible. At this moment it is necessary to make reservations at least three weeks in advance. Pardon, mâsieur.â
Richard marvelled at the idea that there were people who actually knew what they wanted to do three weeks in advance, thanked the maÃ®tre dâ and rang off. Well, maybe a pizza again instead. This thought connected back to the appointment he had failed to keep last night, and after a moment curiosity overcame him and he reached for the phone book again.

Gentleman... Gentles... Gentry.
There was no Gently at all. Not a single one. He found the other directories, exceptfor the S-Z book whichhiscleaning lady continually threw away for reasons he had never yet fathomed.
There was certainly no Cjelli, or anything like it. There was no Jently, no Dgently, no Djently, no Dzently, nor anything remotely similar. He wondered about Tjently, Tsentli or Tzentli and tried Directory Enquiries, but they were out. He sat and tapped his teeth with a pencil again and watched his sofa slowly revolving on the screen of his computer.
How very peculiar it had been that it had only been hours earlier that Reg had asked after Dirk with such urgency.
If you really wanted to find someone, how would you set about it, what would you do?
He tried phoning the police, but they were out too. Well, that was that. He had done all he could do for the moment short of hiring a private detective, and he had better ways of wasting his time and money. He would run into Dirk again, as he did every few years or so.
He found it hard to believe there were really such people, anyway, as private detectives.
What sort of people were they? What did they look like, where did they work?
What sort of tie would you wear if you were a private detective? Presumably it would have to be exactly the sort of tie that people wouldnât expect private detectives to wear. Imagine having to sort out a problem like that when youâd

just got up.
Just out of curiosity as much as anything else, and because the only alternative was settling down to Anthem coding, he found himself leafing through the Yellow Pages.
Private Detectives -- see Detective Agencies.
The words looked almost odd in such a solid and businesslike context. He flipped back through the book. Dry Cleaners, Dog Breeders, Dental Technicians, Detective Agencies...
At that moment the phone rang and he answered it, a little curtly. He didnât like being interrupted.
âSomething wrong, Richard?â
âOh, hi, Kate, sorry, no. I was... my mind was elsewhere.â
Kate Anselm was another star programmer at WayForward Technologies. She was working on a long-term Artificial Intelligence project, the sort of thing that sounded like an absurd pipe dream until you heard her talking about it. Gordon needed to hear her talking about it quite regularly, partly because he was nervous about the money it was costing and partly because, well, there was little doubt that Gordon liked to hear Kate talking anyway.
âI didnât want to disturb you,â she said. âItâs just I was trying to contact Gordon and canât. Thereâs no reply from London or the cottage, or his car or his bleeper. Itâs just that for someone as obsessively in contact as Gordon itâs a bit odd. You heard heâs had a phone put in his isolation tank? True.â
âI havenât spoken to him since yesterday,â said Richard. He suddenly remembered the tape he had taken from Susanâs answering machine, and hoped to God there wasnât anything more important in Gordonâs message than ravings about rabbits. He said, âI know he was going to the cottage. Er, I donât know where he is. Have you tried --â Richard couldnât think of anywhere else to try -- â...er. Good God.â

âRichard?â
âHow extraordinary...â
âRichard, whatâs the matter?â
âNothing, Kate. Er, Iâve just read the most astounding thing.â
âReally, what are you reading?â
âWell, the telephone directory, in fact...â
âReally? I must rush out and buy one. Have the film rights gone?â
âLook, sorry, Kate, can I get back to you? I donât know where Gordon is at the moment and --â
âDonât worry. I know how it is when you canât wait to turn the next page. They always keep you guessing till the end, donât they? It must have been Zbigniew that did it. Have a good weekend.â She hung up.
Richard hung up too, and sat staring at the box advertisement lying open in front of him in the Yellow Pages.

33a Peckender St., London N1 01-354 9112
Peckender Street was only a few minutesâwalk away. Richard scribbled down the address, pulled on his coat and trotted downstairs, stopping to make another quick inspection of the sofa. There must, he thought, be something terribly obvious that he was overlooking. The sofa was jammed on a slight turn in the long narrow stairway. At this point the stairs were interrupted for a couple of yards of flat landing, which corresponded with the position of the flat directly beneath Richardâs. However, his inspection produced no new insights, and he eventually clambered on over it and out of the front door.
In Islington you can hardly hurl a brick without hitting three antique shops, an estate agent and a bookshop.
Even if you didnât actually hit them you would certainly set off their burglar alarms, which wouldnât be turned off again till after the weekend. A police car played its regular game of dodgems down Upper Street and squealed to a halt just past him. Richard crossed the road behind it.
The day was cold and bright, which he liked. He walked across the top of Islington Green, where winos get beaten up, past the site of the old Collins Music Hall which had got burnt down, and through Camden Passage where American tourists get ripped off. He browsed among the antiques for a while and looked at a pair of earrings that he thought Susan would like, but he wasnât sure. Then he wasnât sure that he liked them, got confused and gave up. He looked in at a bookshop, and on an impulse bought an anthology of Coleridgeâs poems since it was just lying there.
From here he threaded his way through the winding back streets, over the canal, past the council estates that lined the canal, through a number of smaller andsmaller squares, till finally he reached Peckender Street, which had turned out to be a good deal farther than heâd thought.
It was the sort of street where property developers in large Jaguars drive around at the weekend salivating. It was full of end-of-lease shops, Victorian industrial architecture and a short, decaying late-Georgian terrace, all just

itching to be pulled down so that sturdy young concrete boxes could sprout in their places. Estate agents roamed the area in hungry packs, eyeing each other warily, their clipboards on a hair trigger.
Number 33, when he eventually found it neatly sandwiched between 37 and 45, was in a poorish state of repair, but no worse than most of the rest.
The ground floor was a dusty travel agentâs whose window was cracked and whose faded BOAC posters were probably now quite valuable. The doorway next to the shop had been painted bright red, not well, but at least recently. A push button next to the door said, in neatly pencilled lettering, âDominique, French lessons, 3me Floorâ.
The most striking feature of the door, however, was the bold and shiny brass plaque fixed in the dead centre of it, on which was engraved the legend âDirk Gentlyâs Holistic Detective Agencyâ.
Nothing else. It looked brand new -- even the screws that held it in place were still shiny.
The door opened to Richardâs push and he peered inside.
He saw a short and musty hallway which contained little but the stairway that led up from it. A door at the back of the hall showed little sign of having been opened in recent years, and had stacks of old metal shelving, a fish tank and the carcass of a bike piled up against it. Everything else, thewalls, the floor,the stairs themselves, and as much of the rear door as could be got at, had been painted grey in an attempt to smarten it up cheaply, but it was all now badly scuffed, and little cups of fungus were peeking from a damp stain near the ceiling.
The sounds of angry voices reached him, and as he started up the stairs he was able to disentangle the noises of two entirely separate but heated arguments that were going on somewhere above him.
One ended abruptly -- or at least half of it did -- as an angry overweight man came clattering down the stairs pulling his raincoat collar straight. The

other half of the argument continued in a torrent of aggrieved French from high above them. The man pushed past Richard, said, âSave your money, mate, itâs a complete washout,â and disappeared out into the chilly morning.
The other argument was more muffled. As Richard reached the first corridor
a door slammed somewhere and brought that too to an end. He looked into the nearest open doorway.
It led into a small ante-office. The other, inner door leading from it was firmly closed. A youngish plump-faced girl in a cheap blue coat was pulling sticks of make-up and boxes of Kleenex out of her desk drawer and thrusting them into her bag.
âIs this the detective agency?â Richard asked her tentatively. The girl nodded, biting her lip and keeping her head down. âAnd is Mr Gently in?â
âHe may be,â she said, throwing back her hair, which was too curly for throwing back properly, âand then again he may not be. I am not in a position to tell. It is not my business to know of his whereabouts. His whereabouts are, as of now, entirely his own business.â
She retrieved her last pot of nail varnish and tried to slam the drawer shut. A fat book sitting upright in the drawer prevented it from closing. She tried to slam the drawer again, without success. She picked up the book, ripped out a clump of pages and replaced it. This time she was able to slam the drawer with ease.
âAre you his secretary?â asked Richard.
âI am his ex-secretary and I intend to stay that way,â she said, firmly snapping her bag shut. âIf he intends to spend his money on stupid expensive brass plaques rather than on paying me, then let him. But I wonât stay to
stand for it, thank you very much. Good for business, my foot. Answering the phones properly is good for business and Iâd like to see his fancy brass plaque

do that. If youâll excuse me Iâd like to storm out, please.â Richard stood aside, and out she stormed.
âAnd good riddance!â shouted a voice from the inner office. A phone rang and was picked up immediately.
âYes?â answered the voice from the inner office, testly. The girl popped back for her scarf, but quietly, so her ex-employer wouldnât hear. Then she was finally gone.
âYes, Dirk Gentlyâs Holistic Detective Agency. How can we be of help to you?â
The torrent of French from upstairs had ceased. A kind of tense calm descended.
Inside, the voice said,âThatâs right, Mrs Sunderland, messy divorces are our particular speciality.â
There was a pause.
âYes, thank you, Mrs Sunderland, not quite that messy.â Down went the phone again, to be replaced instantly by the ringing of another one.
Richard looked around the grim little office. There was very little in it. A battered chipboard veneer desk, an old grey filing cabinet and a dark green tin wastepaper bin. On the wall was a Duran Duran poster on which someone had scrawled in fat red felt tip, âTake this down pleaseâ.
Beneath that another hand had scrawled, âNoâ.
Beneath that again the first hand had written, âI insist that you take it downâ. Beneath that the second hand had written, âWonât!â
Beneath that -- âYouâre firedâ.

Beneath that -- âGood!â
And there the matter appeared to have rested.
He knocked on the inner door, but was not answered. Instead the voice continued, âIâm very glad you asked me that, Mrs Rawlinson. The term âholisticâ refers to my conviction that what we are concerned with here is the fundamental interconnectedness of all things. I do not concern myself with such petty things as fingerprint powder, telltale pieces of pocket fluff and inane footprints. I see the solution to each problem as being detectable in the pattern and web of the whole. The connections between causes and effects are often much more subtle and complex than we with our rough and ready understanding of the physical world might naturally suppose, Mrs Rawlinson.
âLet me give you an example. If you go to an acupuncturist with toothache he sticks a needle instead into your thigh. Do you know why he does that, Mrs Rawlinson?
âNo, neither do I, Mrs Rawlinson, but we intend to find out. A pleasure talking to you, Mrs Rawlinson. Goodbye.â
Another phone was ringing as he put this one down. Richard eased the door open and looked in.
It was the same Svlad, or Dirk, Cjelli. Looking a little rounder about the middle, a little looser and redder about the eyes and the neck, but it was still essentially the same face that he remembered most vividly smiling a grim smile as its owner climbed into the back of one of the Black Marias of the Cambridgeshire constabulary, eight years previously.
He wore a heavy old light brown suit which looked as if it has been worn extensively for bramble hacking expeditions in some distant and better past, a red checked shirt which failed entirely to harmonise with the suit, and a green striped tie which refused to speak to either of them. He also wore thick metal- rimmed spectacles, which probably accounted at least in part for his dress

sense.
âAh, Mrs Bluthall, how thoroughly uplifting to hear from you,â he was saying. âI was so distressed to learn that Miss Tiddles has passed over. This is desperate news indeed. And yet, and yet... Should we allow black despair to hide from us the fairer light in which your blessed moggy now forever dwells?
âI think not. Hark. I think I hear Miss Tiddles miaowing even now. She calls to you, Mrs Bluthall. She says she is content, she is at peace. She says sheâll be even more at peace when youâve paid some bill or other. Does that ring a bell with you at all, Mrs Bluthall? Come to think of it I think I sent you one myself not three months ago. I wonder if it can be that which is disturbing her eternal rest.â
Dirk beckoned Richard in with a brisk wave and then motioned him to pass the crumpled pack of French cigarettes that was sitting just out of his reach.
âSunday night, then, Mrs Bluthall, Sunday night at eight-thirty. You know the address. Yes, Iâm sure Miss Tiddles will appear, as Iâm sure will your cheque book. Till then, Mrs Bluthall, till then.â
Another phone was already ringing as he got rid of Mrs Bluthall. He grabbed at it, lighting his crumpled cigarette at the same time.
âAh, Mrs Sauskind,â he said in answer to the caller, âmy oldest and may I say most valued client. Good day to you, Mrs Sauskind, good day. Sadly, no sign as yet of young Roderick, Iâm afraid, but the search is intensifying as it
moves into what I am confident are its closing stages, and I am sanguine that within mere days from todayâs date we will have the young rascal permanently restored to your arms and mewing prettily, ah yes the bill, I was wondering if you had received it.â
Dirkâs crumpled cigarette turned out to be too crumpled to smoke, so he hooked the phone on his shoulder and poked around in the packet for another, but it was empty.

He rummaged on his desk for a piece of paper and a stub of pencil and wrote a note which he passed to Richard.
âYes, Mrs Sauskind,â he assured the telephone, âI am listening with the utmost attention.â
The note said âTell secretary get cigsâ.
âYes,â continued Dirk into the phone, âbut as I have endeavoured to explain to you, Mrs Sauskind, over the seven years of our acquaintance, I incline to the quantum mechanical view in this matter. My theory is that your cat is not lost, but that his waveform has temporarily collapsed and must be restored. SchrÃ¶dinger. Planck. And so on.â
Richard wrote on the note âYou havenât got secretaryâ and pushed it back.
Dirk considered this for a while, then wrote âDamn and blastâ on the paper and pushed it to Richard again.
âI grant you, Mrs Sauskind,â continued Dirk blithely, âthat nineteen years is, shall we say, a distinguished age for a cat to reach, yet can we allow ourselves to believe that a cat such as Roderick has not reached it?
âAnd should we now in the autumn of his years abandon him to his fate? This surely is the time that he most needs the support of our continuing investigations. This is the time that we should redouble our efforts, and with your permission, Mrs Sauskind, that is what I intend to do. Imagine, Mrs Sauskind, how you would face him if you had not done this simple thing for him.â
Richard fidgeted with the note, shrugged to himself, and wrote âIâll get themâ on it and passed it back once more.
Dirk shook his head in admonition, then wrote âI couldnât possibly that would be most kindâ. As soon as Richard had read this, Dirk took the note back and added âGet money from secretaryâ to it.

Richard looked at the paper thoughtfully, took the pencil and put a tick next to where hehad previously written âYou havenât got secretaryâ. He pushed the paper back across the table to Dirk, who merely glanced at it and ticked âI couldnât possibly that would be most kindâ.
âWell, perhaps,â continued Dirk to Mrs Sauskind, âyou could just run over any of the areas in the bill that cause you difficulty. Just the broader areas.â
Richard let himself out.
Running down the stairs, he passed a young hopeful in a denim jacket and close-cropped hair peering anxiously up the stairwell.
âAny good, mate?â he said to Richard.
âAmazing,â murmured Richard, âjust amazing.â
He found a nearby newsagentâs and picked up a couple of packets of Disque Bleu for Dirk, and a copy of the new edition of Personal Computer World, which had a picture of Gordon Way on the front.
âPity about him, isnât it?â said the newsagent.
âWhat? Oh, er... yes,â said Richard. He often thought the same himself, but was surprised to find his feelings so widely echoed. He picked up a Guardian as well, paid and left.
Dirk was still on the phone with his feet on the table when Richard returned, and it was clear that he was relaxing into his negotiations.âYes, expenses were, well, expensive in the Bahamas, Mrs Sauskind, it is in the nature of expenses to be so. Hence the name.â He took the proffered packets of cigarettes, seemed disappointed there were only two, but briefly raised his eyebrows to Richard in acknowledgement of the favour he had done him, and then waved him to a chair.
The sounds of an argument conducted partly in French drifted down from the floor above.

âOf course I will explain to you again why the trip to the Bahamas was so vitally necessary,â said Dirk Gently soothingly. âNothing could give me greater pleasure. I believe, as you know, Mrs Sauskind, in the fundamentalinterconnectedness of all things. Furthermore I have plotted and triangulated the vectors of the interconnectedness of all things and traced them to a beach in Bermuda which it is therefore necessary for me to visit from time to time in the course of my investigations. I wish it were not the
case, since, sadly, I am allergic to both the sun and rum punches, but then we all have our crosses to bear, do we not, Mrs Sauskind?â
A babble seemed to break out from the telephone.
âYou sadden me, Mrs Sauskind. I wish I could find it in my heart to tell you that I find your scepticism rewarding and invigorating, but with the best will in the world I cannot. I am drained by it, Mrs Sauskind, drained. I think you will find an item in the bill to that effect. Let me see.â
He picked up a flimsy carbon copy lying near him.
ââDetecting and triangulating the vectors of interconnectedness of all things, one hundred and fifty pounds.â Weâve dealt with that.
ââTracing same to beach on Bahamas, fare and accommodation.â A mere fifteen hundred.The accommodation was, of course, distressingly modest.
âAh yes, here we are, âStruggling on in the face of draining scepticism from client, drinks -- three hundred and twenty-seven pounds fifty.ââWould that I did not have to make such charges, my dear Mrs Sauskind, would that the occasion did not continually arise. Not believing in my methods only makes my job more difficult, Mrs Sauskind, and hence, regrettably, more expensive.â
Upstairs, the sounds of argument were becoming more heated by the moment. The French voice seemed to be verging on hysteria.
âI do appreciate, Mrs Sauskind,â continued Dirk, âthat the cost of the

investigation has strayed somewhat from the original estimate, but I am sure that you will in your turn appreciate that a job which takes seven years to do must clearly be more difficult than one that can be pulled off in an afternoon and must therefore be charged at a higher rate. I have continually to revise my estimate of how difficult the task is in the light of how difficult it has so far proved to be.â
The babble from the phone became more frantic.
âMy dear Mrs Sauskind -- or may I call you Joyce? Very well then. My dear Mrs Sauskind, let me say this. Do not worry yourself about this bill, do not let it alarm or discomfit you. Do not, I beg you, let it become a source of anxiety to you. Just grit your teeth and pay it.â
He pulled his feet down off the table and leaned forward over the desk, inching the telephone receiver inexorably back towards its cradle.
âAs always, the very greatest pleasure to speak with you, Mrs Sauskind. For now, goodbye.â
He at last put down the receiver, picked it up again, and dropped it for the moment into the waste basket.
âMy dear Richard MacDuff,â he said, producing a large flat box from under his desk and pushing it across the table at him, âyour pizza.â
Richard started back in astonishment.
âEr, no thanks,â he said, âI had breakfast. Please. You have it.â
Dirk shrugged. âI told them youâd pop in and settle up over the weekend,â he said. âWelcome, by the way, to my offices.â
He waved a vague hand around the tatty surroundings.
âThe light works,â he said, indicating the window, âthe gravity works,â he said, dropping a pencil on the floor. âAnything else we have to take our chances

with.â
Richard cleared his throat. âWhat,â he said, âis this?â
âWhat is what?â
âThis,â exclaimed Richard, âall this. You appear to have a Holistic Detective Agency and I donât even know what one is.â
âI provide a service that is unique in this world,â said Dirk. âThe term âholisticâ refers to my conviction that what we are concerned with here is the fundamental interconnectedness of all --â
âYes, I got that bit earlier,â said Richard. âI have to say that it sounded a bit like an excuse for exploiting gullible old ladies.â
âExploiting?â asked Dirk. âWell, I suppose it would be if anybody ever paid me, but I do assure you, my dear Richard, that there never seems to be the remotest danger of that. I live in what are known as hopes. I hope for fascinating and remunerative cases, my secretary hopes that I will pay her, her landlord hopes that she will produce some rent, the Electricity Board hopes that he will settle their bill, and so on. I find it a wonderfully optimistic way of life.
âMeanwhile I give a lot of charming and silly old ladies something to be happily cross about and virtually guarantee the freedom of their cats. Is there, you ask -- and I put the question for you because I know you know I hate to be interrupted -- is there a single case that exercises the tiniest part of my intellect, which, as you hardly need me to tell you, is prodigious? No. But do I despair? Am I downcast? Yes. Until,â he added, âtoday.â
âOh, well, Iâm glad of that,â said Richard, âbut what was all that rubbish about cats and quantum mechanics?â
With a sigh Dirk flipped up the lid of the pizza with a single flick of practised fingers. He surveyed the cold round thing with a kind of sadness and then tore off a hunk of it. Pieces of pepperoni and anchovy scattered over his desk.

âI am sure, Richard,â he said, âthat you are familiar with the notion of SchrÃ¶dingerâs Cat,â and he stuffed the larger part of the hunk into his mouth.
âOf course,â said Richard. âWell, reasonably familiar.â âWhat is it?â said Dirk through a mouthful.
Richard shifted irritably in his seat. âItâs an illustration,â he said, âof the principle that at a quantum level all events are governed by probabilities...â
âAt a quantum level, and therefore at all levels,â interrupted Dirk. âThough at any level higher than the subatomic the cumulative effect of those probabilities is, in the normal course of events, indistinguishable from the effect of hard and fast physical laws. Continue.â
He put some more cold pizza into his face.
Richard reflected that Dirkâs was a face into which too much had already been put. What with that and the amount he talked, the traffic through his mouth was almost incessant. His ears, on the other hand, remained almost totally unused in normal conversation.
It occurred to Richard that if Lamarck had been right and you were to take a line through this behaviour for several generations, the chances were that some radical replumbing of the interior of the skull would eventually take place.
Richard continued, âNot only are quantum level events governed by probabilities, but those probabilities arenât even resolved into actual events
until they are measured. Or to use a phrase that I just heard you use in a rather bizarre context, the act of measurement collapses the probability waveform. Up until that point all the possible courses of action open to, say, an electron, coexist as probability waveforms. Nothing is decided. Until itâs measured.â
Dirk nodded. âMore or less,â he said, taking another mouthful. âBut what of the cat?â

Richard decided that there was only one way to avoid having to watch Dirk eat his way through all the rest of the pizza, and that was to eat the rest himself. He rolled it up and took a token nibble off the end. It was rather good. He took another bite.
Dirk watched this with startled dismay.
âSo,â said Richard, âthe idea behind SchrÃ¶dingerâs Cat was to try and imagine a way in which the effects of probabilistic behaviour at a quantum level could be considered at a macroscopic level. Or letâs say an everyday level.â
âYes, letâs,â said Dirk, regarding the rest of the pizza with a stricken look. Richard took another bite and continued cheerfully.
âSo you imagine that you take a cat and put it in a box that you can seal completely. Also in the box you put a small lump of radioactive material, and a phial of poison gas. You arrange it so that within a given period of time there is an exactly fifty-fifty chance that an atom in the radioactive lump
will decay and emit an electron. If it does decay then it triggers the release of the gas and kills the cat. If it doesnât, the cat lives. Fifty-fifty. Depending on the fifty-fifty chance that a single atom does or does not decay.
âThe point as I understand it is this: since the decay of a single atom is a quantum level event that wouldnât be resolved either way until it was observed, and since you donât make the observation until you open the box and see whether the cat is alive or dead, then thereâs a rather extraordinary consequence.
âUntil you do open the box the cat itself exists in an indeterminate state. The possibility that it is alive, and the possibility that it is dead, are two different
waveforms superimposed on each other inside the box. SchrÃ¶dinger put forward this idea to illustrate what he thought was absurd about quantum theory.â
Dirk got up and padded over to the window, probably not so much for the meagre view it afforded over an old warehouse on which an alternative

comedian was lavishing his vast lager commercial fees developing into luxury apartments, as for the lack of view it afforded of the last piece of pizza disappearing.
âExactly,â said Dirk, âbravo!â
âBut whatâs all that got to do with this -- this Detective Agency?ââOh, that. Well, some researchers were once conducting such an experiment, but when they opened up the box, the cat was neither alive nor dead but was in fact completely missing, and they called me in to investigate. I was able to
deduce that nothing very dramatic had happened. The cat had merely got fed up with being repeatedly locked up in a box and occasionally gassed and had taken the first opportunity to hoof it through the window. It was for me the work of a moment to set a saucer of milk by the window and call âBerniceâ in an enticing voice -- the catâs name was Bernice, you understand --â
âNow, wait a minute --â said Richard.
â -- and the cat was soon restored. A simple enough matter, but it seemed to create quite an impression in certain circles, and soon one thing led to another as they do and it all culminated in the thriving career you see before you.â
âWait a minute, wait a minute,â insisted Richard, slapping the table. âYes?â enquired Dirk innocently.
âNow, what are you talking about, Dirk?â
âYou have a problem with what I have told you?â
âWell, I hardly know where to begin,â protested Richard. âAll right. You said that some people were performing the experiment. Thatâs nonsense. SchrÃ¶dingerâs Cat isnât a real experiment. Itâs just an illustration for arguing about the idea. Itâs not something youâd actually do.â
Dirk was watching him with odd attention.

âOh, really?â he said at last. âAnd why not?â
âWell, thereâs nothing you can test. The whole point of the idea is to think about what happens before you make your observation. You canât know whatâs going on inside the box without looking, and the very instant you look the wave packet collapses and the probabilities resolve. Itâs self-defeating. Itâs completely purposeless.â
âYou are, of course, perfectly correct as far as you go,â replied Dirk, returning to his seat. He drew a cigarette out of the packet, tapped it several times on the desk, and leant across the desk and pointed the filter at Richard.
âBut think about this,â he continued. âSupposing you were to introducea psychic, someone with clairvoyantpowers, into the experiment -- someone who is able to divine what state of health the cat is in without opening the box. Someone who has, perhaps, a certain eerie sympathy with cats. What then? Might that furnish us with an additional insight into the problem of quantum physics?â
âIs that what they wanted to do?â
âItâs what they did.â
âDirk, this is complete nonsense.â
Dirk raised his eyebrows challengingly.
âAll right, all right,â said Richard, holding up his palms, âletâs just follow it through. Even if I accepted -- which I donât for one second -- that there was any basis at all for clairvoyance, it wouldnât alter the fundamental undoableness of the experiment. As I said, the whole thing turns on what happens inside the box before itâs observed. It doesnât matter how you observe it, whether you look into the box with your eyes or -- well, with your mind, if you insist. If clairvoyance works, then itâs just another way of looking into the box, and if it doesnât then of course itâs irrelevant.â
âIt might depend, of course, on the view you take of clairvoyance...â

âOh yes? And what view do you take of clairvoyance? I should be very interested to know, given your history.â
Dirk tapped the cigarette on the desk again and looked narrowly at Richard.
There was a deep and prolonged silence, disturbed only by the sound of distant crying in French.
âI take the view I have always taken,â said Dirk eventually. âWhich is?â
âThat I am not clairvoyant.â
âReally,â said Richard. âThen what about the exam papers?â
The eyes of Dirk Gently darkened at the mention of this subject.
âA coincidence,â he said, in a low, savage voice, âa strange and chilling coincidence, but none the less a coincidence. One, I might add, which caused meto spend a considerable timein prison. Coincidences can be frightening and dangerous things.â
Dirk gave Richard another of his long appraising looks.
âI have been watching you carefully,â he said. âYou seem to be extremely relaxed for a man in your position.â
This seemed to Richard to be an odd remark, and he tried to make sense of it for a moment. Then the light dawned, and it was an aggravating light.
âGood heavens,â he said, âhe hasnât got to you as well, has he?â This remark seemed to puzzle Dirk in return.
âWho hasnât got to me?â he said.

âGordon. No, obviously not. Gordon Way. He has this habit of trying to get other people to bring pressure on me to get on with what he sees as important work. I thought for a moment -- oh, never mind. What did you mean, then?â
âAh. Gordon Way has this habit, has he?â
âYes. I donât like it. Why?â
Dirk looked long and hard at Richard, tapping a pencil lightly on the desk.
Then he leaned back in his chair and said as follows: âThe body of Gordon Way was discovered before dawn this morning. He had been shot, strangled, and then his house was set on fire. Police are working on the theory that he was not actually shot in the house because no shotgun pellets were discovered there other than those in the body.
âHowever, pellets were found near to Mr Wayâs Mercedes 500 SEC, which was found abandoned about three miles from his house. This suggests that the body was moved after the murder. Furthermore the doctor who examined the body is of the opinion that Mr Way was in fact strangled after he was shot, which seems to suggest a certain confusion in the mind of the killer.
âBy a startling coincidence it appears that the police last night had occasion to interview a very confused-seeming gentleman who said that he was suffering from some kind of guilt complex about having just run over his employer.
âThat man was a Mr Richard MacDuff, and his employer was the
deceased, Mr Gordon Way. It has further been suggested that Mr Richard MacDuff is one of the two people most likely to benefit from Mr Wayâs death, since WayForward Technologies would almost certainly pass at least partly into his hands. The other person is his only living relative, Miss Susan Way,
into whose flat Mr Richard MacDuff was observed to break last night. The police donât know that bit, of course. Nor, if we can help it, will they. However, any relationship between the two of them will naturally come under close scrutiny. The news reports on the radio say that they are urgently

seeking Mr MacDuff, who they believe will be able to help them with their enquiries, but the tone of voice says that heâs clearly guilty as hell.âMy scale of charges is as follows: two hundred pounds a day, plus expenses. Expenses are not negotiable and will sometimes strike those who do not understand these matters as somewhat tangential. They are all necessary and are, as I say, not negotiable. Am I hired?â
âSorry,â said Richard, nodding slightly. âWould you start that again?â
CHAPTER 17
The Electric Monk hardly knew what to believe any more.
He had been through a bewildering number of belief systems in the previous few hours, most of which had failed to provide him with the long-term spiritual solace that it washis boundenprogramming eternally to seek.
He was fed up. Frankly. And tired. And dispirited.
And furthermore, which caught him by surprise, he rather missed his horse. A dull and menial creature, to be sure, and as such hardly worthy of the preoccupation of one whose mind was destined forever to concern itself with higher things beyond the understanding of a simple horse, but nevertheless he missed it.
He wanted to sit on it. He wanted to pat it. He wanted to feel that it didnât understand.
He wondered where it was.
He dangled his feet disconsolately from the branch of the tree in which he had spent the night. He had climbed it in pursuit of some wild fantastic dream and then had got stuck and had to stay there till the morning.

Even now, by daylight, he wasnât certain how he was going to get down. He came for a moment perilously close to believing that he could fly, but a quick- thinking error-checking protocol cut in and told him not to be so silly.
It was a problem though.
Whatever burning fire of faith had borne him, inspired on wings of hope, upwards through the branches of the tree in the magic hours of night, had not also provided him with instructions on how to get back down again when, like altogether too many of these burning fiery night-time faiths, it had deserted him in the morning.
And speaking -- or rather thinking -- of burning fiery things, there had been a major burning fiery thing a little distance from here in the early pre-dawn hours.
It lay, he thought, in the direction from which he himself had come when he had been drawn by a deep spiritual compulsion towards this inconveniently high but otherwise embarrassingly ordinary tree. He had longed to go and worship at the fire, to pledge himself eternally to its holy glare, but while he had been struggling hopelessly to find a way downwards through the branches, fire engines had arrived and put the divine radiance out, and that had been another creed out of the window.
The sun had been up for some hours now, and though he had occupied the time as best as he could, believing in clouds, believing in twigs, believing in a peculiar form of flying beetle, he believed now that he was fed up, and was utterly convinced, furthermore, that he was getting hungry.
He wished heâd taken the precaution of providing himself with some food from the dwelling place he had visited in the night, to which he had carried his sacred burden for entombment in the holy broom cupboard, but he had left in the grip of a white passion, believing that such mundane matters as food were of no consequence, that the tree would provide.
Well, it had provided. It had provided twigs.

Monks did not eat twigs.
In fact, now he came to think of it, he felt a little uncomfortable about some of the things he had believed last night and had found some of the results a little confusing. He had been quite clearly instructed to âshoot offâ and had felt strangely compelled to obey but perhaps he had made a mistake in acting so precipitately on an instruction given in a language he had learned only two minutes before. Certainly the reaction of the person he had shot off at had seemed a little extreme.In his own world when people were shot at like that they came back next week for another episode, but he didnât think this person would be doing that.
A gust of wind blew through the tree, making it sway giddily. He climbed down a little way. The first part was reasonably easy, since the branches were all fairly close together. It was the last bit that appeared to be an insuperable obstacle -- a sheer drop which could cause him severe internal damage or rupture and might in turn cause him to start believing things that were seriously strange.
The sound of voices over in a distant corner of the field suddenly caught his attention. A lorry had pulled up by the side of the road. He watched carefully for a moment, but couldnât see anything particular to believe in and so returned to his introspection.
There was, he remembered, an odd function call he had had last night, which he hadnât encountered before, but he had a feeling that it might be something heâd heard of called remorse. He hadnât felt at all comfortable about the way the person he had shot at had just lain there, and after initially walking away the Monk had returned to have another look. There was definitely an expression on the personâs face which seemed to suggest that something was up, that this didnât fit in with the scheme of things. The Monk worried that he might have badly spoiled his evening.
Still, he reflected, so long as you did what you believed to be right, that was the main thing.

The next thing he had believed to be right was that having spoiled this personâs evening he should at least convey him to his home, and a quick search of his pockets had produced an address, some maps and some keys. The trip had been an arduous one, but he had been sustained on the way by his faith.
The word âbathroomâ floated unexpectedly across the field.
He looked up again at the lorry in the distant comer. There was a man in a dark blue uniform explaining something to a man in rough working clothes, who seemed a little disgruntled about whatever it was. The words âuntil we trace the ownerâ and âcompletely batty, of courseâ were gusted over on the wind. The man in the working clothes clearly agreed to accept the situation, but with bad grace.
A few moments later, a horse was led out of the back of the lorry and into the field. The Monk blinked. His circuits thrilled and surged with astonishment. Now here at last was something he could believe in, a truly miraculous event, a reward at last for his unstinting if rather promiscuous devotion.
The horse walked with a patient, uncomplaining gait. It had long grown used to being wherever it was put, but for once it felt it didnât mind this. Here, it thought, was a pleasant field. Here was grass. Here was a hedge it could look at. There was enough space that it could go for a trot later on if it felt the urge. The humans drove off and left it to its own devices, to which it was quite content to be left. It went for a little amble, and then, just for the hell of it, stopped ambling. It could do what it liked.
What pleasure.
What very great and unaccustomed pleasure.
It slowly surveyed the whole field, and then decided to plan out a nice relaxed day for itself. A little trot later on, it thought, maybe around threeish. After that a bit of a lie down over on the east side of the field where the grass was thicker. It looked like a suitable spot to think about supper in.
Lunch, it rather fancied, could be taken at the south end of the field where a

small stream ran. Lunch by a stream, for heavenâs sake. This was bliss.
It also quite liked the notion of spending half an hour walking alternately a little bit to the left and then a little bit to the right, for no apparent reason. It didnât know whether the time between two and three would be best spent swishing its tail or mulling things over.
Of course, it could always do both, if it so wished, and go for its trot a little later. And it had just spotted what looked like a fine piece of hedge for watching things over, and that would easily while away a pleasant pre-prandial hour or two.
Good.
An excellent plan.
And the best thing about it was that having made it the horse could now completely and utterly ignore it. It went instead for a leisurely stand under the only tree in the field.
From out of its branches the Electric Monk dropped on to the horseâs back, with a cry which sounded suspiciously like âGeronimoâ.
CHAPTER 18
Dirk Gently briefly ran over the salient facts once more while Richard MacDuffâs world crashed slowly and silently into a dark, freezing sea which he hadnât even known was there, waiting inches beneath his feet. When Dirk had finished for the second time the room fell quiet while Richard stared fixedly at his face.
âWhere did you hear this?â said Richard at last.
âThe radio,â said Dirk, with a slight shrug, âat least the main points. Itâs all

over the news of course. The details? Well, discreet enquiries among contacts here and there. There are one or two people I got to know at Cambridge police station, for reasons which may occur to you.â
âI donât even know whether to believe you,â said Richard quietly. âMay I use the phone?â
Dirk courteously picked a telephone receiver out of the wastepaper bin and handed it to him. Richard dialled Susanâs number.
The phone was answered almost immediately and a frightened voice said, âHello?â
âSusan, itâs Ri --â
âRichard! Where are you? For Godâs sake, where are you? Are you all right?â
âDonât tell her where you are,â said Dirk.
âSusan, whatâs happened?â
âDonât you -- ?â
âSomebody told me that somethingâs happened to Gordon, but...â
âSomethingâs happened-- ? Heâs dead, Richard, heâs been murdered --â
âHang up,â said Dirk.
âSusan, listen. I --â
âHang up,â repeated Dirk, and then leaned forward to the phone and cut him off.
âThe police will probably have a trace on the line,â he explained. He took the receiver and chucked it back in the bin.

âBut I have to go to the police,â Richard exclaimed.
âGo to the police?â
âWhat else can I do? I have to go to the police and tell them that it wasnât me.â
âTell them that it wasnât you?â said Dirk incredulously. âWell I expect that will probably make it all right, then. Pity Dr Crippen didnât think of that. Would have saved him a lot of bother.â
âYes, but he was guilty!â
âYes, so it would appear. And so it would appear, at the moment, are you.â âBut I didnât do it, for Godâs sake!â
âYou are talking to someone who has spent time in prison for something he didnât do, remember. I told you that coincidences are strange and dangerous things. Believe me, it is a great deal better to find cast-iron proof that youâre innocent, than to languish in a cell hoping that the police -- who already think youâre guilty -- will find it for you.â
âI canât think straight,â said Richard, with his hand to his forehead. âJust stop for a moment and let me think this out --â
âIf I may --â
âLet me think -- !â
Dirk shrugged and turned his attention back to his cigarette, which seemed to be bothering him.
âItâs no good,â said Richard shaking his head after a few moments, âI canât take it in. Itâs like trying to do trigonometry when someoneâs kicking your head. OK, tell me what you think I should do.â
âHypnotism.â

âWhat?â
âIt is hardly surprising in the circumstances that you should be unable to gather your thoughts clearly. However, it is vital that somebody gathers them. It will be much simpler for both of us if you will allow me to hypnotise you. I strongly suspect that there is a very great deal of information jumbled up in your head that will not emerge while you are shaking it up so -- that might not emerge at all because you do not realise its significance. With your permission we can shortcut all that.â
âWell, thatâs decided then,â said Richard, standing up, âIâm going to the police.â
âVery well,â said Dirk, leaning back and spreading his palms on the desk, âI wish you the very best of luck. Perhaps on your way out you would be kind enough to ask my secretary to get me some matches.â
âYou havenât got a secretary,â said Richard, and left.
Dirk sat and brooded for a few seconds, made a valiant but vain attempt to fold the sadly empty pizza box into the wastepaper bin, and then went to look in the cupboard for a metronome.
Richard emerged blinking into the daylight. He stood on the top step rocking slightly, then plunged off down the street with an odd kind of dancing walk which reflected the whirling dance of his mind. On the one hand he simply couldnât believe that the evidence wouldnât show perfectly clearly that he couldnât have committed the murder; on the other hand he had to admit that it all looked remarkably odd.
He found it impossible to think clearly or rationally about it. The idea that Gordon had been murdered kept blowing up in his mind and throwing all other thoughts into total confusion and disruption.
It occurred to him for a moment that whoever did it must have been a damn fast shot to get the trigger pulled beforebeing totally overwhelmed by

waves of guilt, but instantly he regretted the thought. In fact he was a little appalled by the general quality of the thoughts that sprang into his mind. They seemed inappropriate and unworthy and mostly had to do with how it would affect his projects in the company.He looked about inside himself for any feeling of great sorrow or regret, and assumed that it must be there somewhere, probably hiding behind the huge wall of shock.
He arrived back within sight of Islington Green, hardly noticing the distance he had walked. The sudden sight of the police squad car parked outside his house hit him like a hammer and he swung on his heel and stared with furious concentration at the menu displayed in the window of a Greek restaurant.
âDolmades,â he thought, frantically.
âSouvlaki,â he thought.
âA small spicy Greek sausage,â passed hectically through his mind. He tried to reconstruct the scene in his mindâs eye without turning round. There had been a policeman standing watching the street, and as far as he could recall from the brief glance he had, it looked as if the side door of the building which led up to his flat was standing open.
The police were in his flat. In his flat. Fassolia Plaki! A filling bowl of haricot beans cooked in a tomato and vegetable sauce!
He tried to shift his eyes sideways and back over his shoulder. The policeman was looking at him. He yanked his eyes back to the menu and tried to fill his mind with finely ground meat mixed with potato, breadcrumbs, onions and herbs rolled into small balls and fried. The policeman must have recognised him and was at that very moment dashing across the road to grab him and lug him off in a Black Maria just as they had done to Dirk all those years ago in Cambridge.
He braced his shoulders against the shock, but no hand came to grab him. He glanced back again, but the policeman was looking unconcernedly in another direction. Stifado.

It was very apparent to him that his behaviour was not that of one who was about to go and hand himself in to the police.
So what else was he to do?
Trying in a stiff, awkward way to walk naturally, he yanked himself away from the window, strolled tensely down the road a few yards, and then ducked back down Camden Passage again, walking fast and breathing hard. Where could he go? To Susan? No -- the police would be there or watching. To the WFT offices in Primrose Hill? No -- same reason. What on earth, he screamed silently at himself, was he doing suddenly as a fugitive?
He insisted to himself, as he had insisted to Dirk, that he should not be running away from the police. The police, he told himself, as he had been taught when he was a boy, were there to help and protect the innocent. This thought caused him instantly to break into a run and he nearly collided with the proud new owner of an ugly Edwardian floor lamp.
âSorry,â he said, âsorry.â He was startled that anyone should want such a thing, and slowed his pace to a walk, glancing with sharp hunted looks around him. The very familiar shop fronts full of old polished brass, old polished wood and pictures of Japanese fish suddenly seemed very threatening and aggressive.
Who could possibly have wanted to kill Gordon? This was the thought that suddenly hammered at him as he turned down Charlton Place. All that had concerned him so far was that he hadnât.
But who had?
This was a new thought.
Plenty of people didnât care for him much, but there is a huge difference between disliking somebody -- maybe even disliking them a lot -- and actually shooting them, strangling them, dragging them through the fields and setting their house on fire. It was a difference which kept the vast majority of the population alive from day to day.

Was it just theft? Dirk hadnât mentioned anything being missing but then he hadnât asked him.
Dirk. The image of his absurd but oddly commanding figure sitting like a large toad, brooding in his shabby office, kept insisting itself upon Richardâs mind. He realised that he was retracing the way he had come, and deliberately made himself turn right instead of left.
That way madness lay.
He just needed a space, a bit of time to think and collect his thoughts together.
All right -- so where was he going? He stopped for a moment, turned around and then stopped again. The idea of dolmades suddenly seemed very attractive and it occurred to him that the cool, calm and collected course of action would have been simply to walk in and have some. That would have shown Fate who was boss.
Instead, Fate was engaged on exactly the same course of action. It wasnât actually sitting in a Greek restaurant eating dolmades, but it might as well have been, because it was clearly in charge. Richardâs footsteps drew him inexorably back through the winding streets, over the canal.
He stopped, briefly, at a corner shop, and then hurried on past the council estates, and into developer territory again until he was standing once more outside 33, Peckender Street. At about the same time as Fate would have been pouring itself the last of the retsina, wiping its mouth and wondering if it had any room left for baklavas, Richard gazed up at the tall ruddy Victorian building with its soot-darkened brickwork and its heavy, forbidding windows. A gust of wind whipped along the street and a small boy bounded up to him.
âFuck off,â chirped the little boy, then paused and looked at him again. ââEre, mister,â he added, âcan I have your jacket?â
âNo,â said Richard.

âWhy not?â said the boy.
âEr, because I like it,â said Richard.
âCanât see why,â muttered the boy. âFuck off.â He slouched off moodily down the street, kicking a stone at a cat.
Richard entered the building once more, mounted the stairs uneasily and looked again into the office.
Dirkâs secretary was sitting at her desk, head down, arms folded. âIâm not here,â she said.
âI see,â said Richard.
âI only came back,â she said, without looking up from the spot on her desk at which she was staring angrily, âto make sure he notices that Iâve gone. Otherwise he might just forget.â
âIs he in?â asked Richard.
âWho knows? Who cares? Better ask someone who works for him, because I donât.â
âShow him in!â boomed Dirkâs voice.
She glowered for a moment, stood up, went to the inner door, wrenched it open, said âShow him in yourself,â slammed the door once more and returned to her seat.
âEr, why donât I just show myself in?â said Richard.
âIcanât evenhear you,âsaid Dirkâs ex-secretary, staring resolutely at her desk. âHow do you expect me to hear you if Iâm not even here?â

Richard made a placatory gesture, which was ignored, and walked through and opened the door to Dirkâs office himself. He was startled to find the room in semi-darkness. A blind was drawn down over the window, and Dirk was lounging back in his seat, his face bizarrely lit by the strange arrangement of objects sitting on the desk. At the forward edge of the desk sat an old grey bicycle lamp, facing backwards and shining a feeble light on a metronome which was ticking softly back and forth, with a highly polished silver teaspoon strapped to its metal rod.
Richard tossed a couple of boxes of matches on to the desk.
âSit down, relax, and keep looking at the spoon,â said Dirk, âyou are already feeling sleepy...â
Another police car pulled itself up to a screeching halt outside Richardâs flat, and a grim-faced man climbed out and strode over to one of the constables on duty outside, flashing an identity card.
âDetective Inspector Mason, Cambridgeshire CID,â he said. âThis the MacDuff place?â
The constable nodded and showed him to the side-door entrance which opened on to the long narrow staircase leading up to the top flat. Mason bustled in and then bustled straight out again.
âThereâs a sofa halfway up the stairs,â he told the constable. âGet it moved.â
âSome of the lads have already tried, sir,â the constable replied anxiously. âIt seems to be stuck. Everyoneâs having to climb over it for the moment, sir. Sorry, sir.â
Mason gave him another grim look from a vast repertoire he had developed which ranged from very, very blackly grim indeed at the bottom of the scale, all the way up to tiredly resigned and only faintly grim, which he reserved for his childrenâs birthdays.
âGet it moved,â he repeated grimly, and bustled grimly back through the door

grimly hauling up his trousers and coat in preparation for the grim ascent ahead.
âNo sign of him yet?â asked the driver of the car, coming over himself. âSergeant Gilks,â he introduced himself. He looked tired.
âNot as far as I know,â said the constable, âbut no one tells me anything.â
âKnow how you feel,â agreed Gilks. âOnce the CID gets involved you just get relegated to driving them about. And Iâm the only one who knows what he looked like. Stopped him in the road last night. We just came from Wayâs house. Right mess.â
âBad night, eh?â
âVaried. Everything from murder to hauling horses out of bathrooms. No, donât even ask. Do you have the same cars as these?â he added, pointing at his
own. âThis oneâs been driving me crazy all the way up. Cold even with the heater on full blast, and the radio keeps turning itself on and off.â
CHAPTER 19
The same morning found Michael Wenton-Weakes in something of an odd mood.
You would need to know him fairly well to know that it was an especially odd mood, because most people regarded him as being a little odd to start with. Few people knew him that well. His mother, perhaps, but there existed between them a state of cold war and neither had spoken to the other now in weeks.
He also had an elder brother, Peter, who was now tremendously senior in the Marines. Apart from at their fatherâs funeral, Michael had not seen Peter since he came back from the Falklands, covered in glory, promotion, and

contempt for his younger brother.
Peter had been delighted that their mother had taken over Magna, and had sent Michael a regimental Christmas card to that effect. His own greatest satisfaction still remained that of throwing himself into a muddy ditch and firing a machine gun for at least a minute, and he didnât think that the British newspaper and publishing industry, even in its current state of unrest, was likely to afford him that pleasure, at least until some more Australians moved into it.
Michael had risen very late after a night of cold savagery and then of troubled dreams which still disturbed him now in the late morning daylight.
His dreams had been filled with the familiar sensations of loss, isolation,
guilt and so forth, but had also been inexplicably involved with large quantities of mud. By the telescopic power of the night, the nightmareof mud andloneliness had seemed to stretch on for terrifying, unimaginable lengths of time, and had only concluded with the appearance of slimy things with legs that had crawled on the slimy sea. This had been altogether too much and he had woken with a start in a cold sweat.
Though all the business with the mud had seemed strange to him, the sense of loss, of isolation, and above all the aggrievement, the need to undo what had been done, these had all found an easy home in his spirit.
Even the slimy things with legs seemed oddly familiar and ticked away irritably at the back of his mind while he made himself a late breakfast, a piece of grapefruit and some China tea, allowed his eyes to rest lightly on the arts pages of the Daily Telegraph for a while, and then rather clumsily changed the dressing on the cuts on his hand.These small tasks accomplished, he was then in two minds as to what to do next.
He was able to view the events of the previous night with a cool detachment that he would not have expected. It had been right, it had been proper, it had been correctly done. But it resolved nothing. All that mattered was yet to be done.

All what? He frowned at the odd way his thoughts ebbed and flowed.
Normally he would pop along to his club at about this time. It used to be that he would do this with a luxurious sense of the fact that there were many other things that he should be doing. Now there was nothing else to do, which made time spent there, as anywhere else, hang somewhat heavy on his hands.
When he went he would do as he always did -- indulge in a gin and tonic and a little light conversation, and then allow his eyes to rest gently on the pages of the Times Literary Supplement, Opera, The New Yorker or whatever else fell easily to hand, but there was no doubt that he did it these days with less verve and relish than previously.
Then there would be lunch. Today, he had no lunch date planned -- again -- and would probably therefore have stayed at his club, and eaten a lightly grilled Dover sole, with potatoes garnished with parsley and boiled to bits, followed by a large heap of trifle. A glass or two of Sancerre. And coffee. And then the afternoon, with whatever that might bring.
But today he felt oddly impelled not to do that. He flexed the muscles in his cut hand, poured himself another cup of tea, looked with curious dispassion at the large kitchen knife that still lay by the fine bone china teapot, and waited for a moment to see what he would do next. What he did next, in fact, was to walk upstairs.
His house was rather chill in its formal perfection, and looked much as people who buy reproduction furniture would like their houses to look. Except of course that everything here was genuine -- crystal, mahogany and Wilton -- and only looked as if it might be fake because there was no life to any of it.
He walked up into his workroom, which was the only room in the house that was not sterile with order, but here the disorder of books and papers was instead sterile with neglect. A thin film of dust had settled over everything. Michael had not been into it in weeks, and the cleaner was under strict instructions to leave it well alone. He had not worked here since he edited the last edition of Fathom. Not, of course, the actual last edition, but the last proper edition. The last edition as far as he was concerned.

He set his china cup down in the fine dust and went to inspect his elderly record player. On it he found an elderly recording of some Vivaldi wind concertos, set it to play and sat down.
He waited again to see what he would do next and suddenly found to his surprise that he was already doing it, and it was this: he was listening to the music.
A bewildered look crept slowly across his face as he realised that he had never done this before. He had heard it many, many times and thought that it made a very pleasant noise. Indeed, he found that it made a pleasant background against which to discuss the concert season, but it had never before occurred to him that there was anything actually to listen to.
He sat thunderstruck by the interplay of melody and counterpoint which suddenly stood revealed to him with a clarity that owed nothing to the dust- ridden surface of the record or the fourteen-year-old stylus.
But withthis revelation came an almostimmediate sense of disappointment, which confused him all the more. The music suddenly revealed to him was oddly unfulfilling. It was as if his capacity to understand the music had suddenly increased up to and far beyond the musicâs ability to satisfy it, all in one dramatic moment.
He strained to listen for what was missing, and felt that the music was like a flightless bird that didnât even know what capacity it had lost. It walked very well, but it walked where it should soar, it walked where it should swoop, it walked where it should climb and bank and dive, it walked where it should thrill with the giddiness of flight. It never even looked up.
He looked up.
After a while he became aware that all he was doing was simply staring stupidly at the ceiling. He shook his head, and discovered that the perception had faded, leaving him feeling slightly sick and dizzy. It had not vanished entirely, but had dropped deep inside him, deeper than he could reach.

The music continued. It was an agreeable enough assortment of pleasant sounds in the background, but it no longer stirred him.
He needed some clues as to what it was he had just experienced, and a thought flicked momentarily at the back of his mind as to where he might find them. He let go of the thought in anger, but it flicked at him again, and kept on flicking at him until at last he acted upon it.From under his desk he pulled out the large tin wastepaper bin. Since he had barred his cleaning lady from even coming in here for the moment, the bin had remained unemptied and he found in it the tattered shreds of what he was looking for with the contents of an ashtray emptied over them.
He overcame his distaste with grim determination and slowly jiggled around the bits of the hated object on his desk, clumsily sticking them together with bits of sticky tape that curled around and stuck the wrong bit to the wrong bit and stuck the right bit to his pudgy fingers and then to the desk, until at last there lay before him, crudely reassembled, a copy of Fathom. As edited by the execrable creature A. K. Ross.
Appalling.
He turned the sticky lumpish pages as if he was picking over chicken giblets. Not a single line drawing of Joan Sutherland or Marilyn Horne anywhere. No profiles of any of the major Cork Street art dealers, not a one.
His series on the Rossettis: discontinued.
âGreen Room Gossipâ: discontinued.
He shook his head in incredulity and then he found the article he was after. âMusic and Fractal Landscapesâ by Richard MacDuff.
He skipped over the first couple of paragraphs of introduction and picked it up further on:

Mathematical analysis and computer modelling are revealing to us that the shapes and processes we encounter in nature -- the way that plants grow, the way that mountains erode or rivers flow, the way that snowflakes or islands achieve their shapes, the way that light plays on a surface, the way the milk folds and spins into your coffee as you stir it, the way that laughter sweeps through a crowd of people -- all these things in their seemingly magical complexity can be described by the interaction of mathematical processes that are, if anything, even more magical in their simplicity.
Shapes that we think of as random are in fact the products
of complex shifting webs of numbers obeying simple rules. The very word ânaturalâthat we have often taken to mean âunstructuredâ in fact describes shapes and processes that appear so unfathomably complex that we cannot consciously perceive the simple natural laws at work.

They can all be described by numbers.
Oddly, this idea seemed less revolting now to Michael than it had done on his first, scant reading.
He read on with increasing concentration.
We know, however, that the mind is capable of understanding these matters in all their complexity and in all their simplicity. A ball flying through the air is responding to the force and direction with which it was thrown, the action of gravity, the friction of the air which it must expend its energy on overcoming, the turbulence of the air around its surface, and the rate and direction of the ballâs spin.
And yet, someone who might have difficulty consciously trying towork outwhat 3 x4x5comesto would haveno trouble in doing differential calculus and a whole host of

related calculations so astoundingly fast that they /can actually catch a flying ball./
People who call this âinstinctâ are merely giving the phenomenon a name, not explaining anything.
I think that the closest that human beings come to expressing our understanding of these natural complexities is in music. It is the most abstract of the arts -- it has no meaning or purpose other than to be itself.
Every single aspect of a piece of music can be represented
by numbers. From the organisation of movements in a whole symphony, down through the patterns of pitch and rhythm that make up the melodies and harmonies, the dynamics that shape the performance, all the way down to the timbres of the notes themselves, their harmonics, the way they change over time, in short, all the elements of a noise that distinguish between

the sound of one person piping on a piccolo and another one thumping a drum -- all of these things can be expressed by patterns and hierarchies of numbers.
And in my experience the more internal relationships there
are between the patterns of numbers at different levels of the hierarchy, however complex and subtle those relationships may be, the more satisfying and, well, whole, the music will seem to be.
In fact the more subtle and complex those relationships, and the further they are beyond the grasp of the conscious mind, the more the instinctive part of your mind -- by which I mean that part of your mind that can do differential calculus so astoundingly fast that it will put your hand in the right place to catch a flying ball -- the more that part of your brain revels in it.
Music of any complexity (and even âThree Blind Miceâ is

complex in its way by the time someone has actually performed it on an instrument with its own individual timbre and articulation) passes beyond your conscious mind into the arms of your own private mathematical genius who dwells in your unconscious responding to all the inner complexities and relationships and proportions that we think we know nothing about.
Some people object to such a view of music, saying that if
you reduce music to mathematics, where does the emotion come into it? I would say that itâs never been out of it.
The things by which our emotions can be moved -- the shape of a flower or a Grecian urn, the way a baby grows, the way the wind brushes across your face, the way clouds move, their shapes, the way light dances on the water, or daffodils flutter in the breeze, the way in which the person you love moves their head, the way their hair follows that movement,

the curve described by the dying fall of the last chord of a piece of music -- all these things can be described by the complex flow of numbers.
Thatâs not a reduction of it, thatâs the beauty of it.
Ask Newton.
Ask Einstein.
Ask the poet (Keats) who said that what the imagination seizes as beauty must be truth.
He might also have said that what the hand seizes as a ball must be truth, but he didnât, because he was a poet and preferred loafing about under trees with a bottle of laudanum and a notebook to playing cricket, but it would have been equally true.

This jogged a thought at the back of Michaelâs memory, but he couldnât immediately place it.
Because that is at the heart of the relationship between on
the one hand our âinstinctiveâ understanding of shape, form, movement, light, and on the other hand our emotional responses to them.
And that is why I believe that there must be a form of music inherent in nature, in natural objects, in the patterns of natural processes. A music that would be as deeply satisfying as any naturally occurring beauty -- and our own deepest emotions are, after all, a form of naturally occurring beauty...
Michael stopped reading and let his gaze gradually drift from the page.
He wondered if he knew what such a music would be and tried to grope in the dark recesses of his mind for it. Each part of his mind that he visited seemed as if that music had been playing there only seconds before and all that was

left was the last dying echo of something he was unable to catch at and hear. He laid the magazine limply aside.
Then he remembered what it was that the mention of Keats had jogged in his memory.
The slimy things with legs from his dream.
A cold calm came over him as he felt himself coming very close to something.
Coleridge. That man.
Yea, slimy things did crawl with legsUpon the slimy sea. âThe Rime of the Ancient Mariner.â
Dazed, Michael walked over to the bookshelf and pulled down his Coleridge anthology. He took it back to his seat and with a certain apprehension he riffled through the pages until he found the opening lines.
It is an ancient Mariner,And he stoppeth one of three.
The words were very familiar to him, and yet as he read on through them they awoke in him strange sensations and fearful memories that he knew were not his. There reared up inside him a sense of loss and desolation of terrifying intensity which, while he knew it was not his own, resonated so perfectly now with his own aggrievements that he could not but surrender to it absolutely.
And a thousand thousand slimy thingsLived on; and so did I.
CHAPTER 20
The blind rolled up with a sharp rattle and Richard blinked.

âA fascinating evening you appear to have spent,â said Dirk Gently, âeven though the most interesting aspects of it seem to have escaped your curiosity entirely.â
He returned to his seat and lounged back in it pressing his fingertips together.
âPlease,â he said, âdo not disappoint me by saying âwhere am I?â A glance will suffice.â
Richard looked around him in slow puzzlement and felt as if he were returning unexpectedly from a long sojourn on another planet where all was peace and light and music that went on for ever and ever. He felt so relaxed he could hardly be bothered to breathe.
The wooden toggle on the end of the blind cord knocked a few times against the window, but otherwise all was now silent. The metronome was still. He glanced at his watch. It was just after one oâclock.
âYou have been under hypnosis for a little less than an hour,â said Dirk, âduring which I have learned many interesting things and been puzzled by some others which I would now like to discuss with you. A little fresh air will probably help revive you and I suggest a bracing stroll along the canal. No one will be looking for you there. Janice!âSilence.
A lot of things were still not clear to Richard, and he frowned to himself. When his immediate memory returned a moment later, it was like an elephant suddenly barging through the door and he sat up with a startled jolt.
âJanice!â shouted Dirk again. âMiss Pearce! Damn the girl.â
He yanked the telephone receivers out of the wastepaper basket and replaced them. An old and battered leather briefcase stood by the desk, and he picked this up, retrieved his hat from the floor and stood up, screwing his hat absurdly on his head.

âCome,â he said, sweeping through the door to where Miss Janice Pearce sat glaring at a pencil, âlet us go. Let us leave this festering hellhole. Let us think the unthinkable, let us do the undoable. Let us prepare to grapple with the ineffable itself, and see if we may not eff it after all. Now, Janice --ââShut up.â
Dirk shrugged, and then picked off her desk the book which earlier she had mutilated when trying to slam her drawer. He leafed through it, frowning, and then replaced it with a sigh. Janice returned to what she had clearly been doing a moment or two earlier, which was writing a long note with the pencil.
Richard regarded all this in silence, still feeling only semi-present. He shook his head.
Dirk said to him, âEvents may seem to you to be a tangled mass of confusion at the moment. And yet we have some interesting threads to pull on. For of all the things you have told me that have happened, only two are actually physically impossible.â
Richard spoke at last. âImpossible?â he said with a frown. âYes,â said Dirk, âcompletely and utterly impossible.â
He smiled.
âLuckily,â he went on, âyou have come to exactly the right place withyourinteresting problem, for there is no suchword as âimpossibleâ in my dictionary. In fact,â he added, brandishing the abused book, âeverything between âherringâ and âmarmaladeâ appears to be missing. Thank you, Miss Pearce, you have once again rendered me sterling service, for which I thank you and will, in the event of a successful outcome to this endeavour, even attempt to pay you. In the meantime we have much to think on, and I leave the office in your very capable hands.â
The phone rang and Janice answered it.
âGood afternoon,âshe said,âWainwrightâs Fruit Emporium. Mr Wainwright is not able to take calls at this time since he is not right in the head and thinks he is

a cucumber. Thank you for calling.â
She slammed the phone down. She looked up again to see the door closing softly behind her ex-employer and his befuddled client.
âImpossible?â said Richard again, in surprise.
âEverything about it,â insisted Dirk, âcompletely and utterly -- well, let us say inexplicable. There is no point in using the word âimpossibleâ to describe something that has clearly happened. But it cannot be explained by anything we know.â
The briskness of the air along the Grand Union Canal got in among Richardâs senses and sharpened them up again. He was restored to his normal faculties, and though the fact of Gordonâs death kept jumping at him all over again every few seconds, he was at least now able to think more clearly about it. Oddly enough, though, that seemed for the moment to be the last thing on Dirkâs mind. Dirk was instead picking on the most trivial of the nightâs sequence of bizarre incidents on which to cross-examine him.
A jogger going one way and a cyclist going the other both shouted at each other to get out of the way, and narrowly avoided hurling each other into the murky, slow-moving waters of the canal. They were watched carefully by a very slow-moving old lady who was dragging an even slower-moving old dog.
On the other bank large empty warehouses stood startled, every window shattered and glinting. A burned-out barge lolled brokenly in the water. Within it a couple of detergent bottles floated on the brackish water. Over the nearest bridge heavy-goods lorries thundered, shaking the foundations of the houses, belching petrol fumes into the air and frightening a mother trying to cross the road with her pram.
Dirk and Richard were walking along from the fringes of South Hackney, amile from Dirkâs office, back towards the heart of Islington, where Dirk knew the nearest lifebelts were positioned.

âBut it was only a conjuring trick, for heavenâs sake,â said Richard. âHe does them all the time. Itâs just sleight of hand. Looks impossible but Iâm sure if you asked any conjurer heâd say itâs easy once you know how these things are done. I once saw a man on the street in New York doing --â
âI know how these things are done,â said Dirk, pulling two lighted cigarettes and a large glazed fig out of his nose. He tossed the fig up in to the air, but it somehow failed to land anywhere. âDexterity, misdirection, suggestion. All things you can learn if you have a little time to waste. Excuse me, dear lady,â he said to the elderly, slow-moving dog-owner as they passed her. He bent down to the dog and pulled a long string of brightly coloured flags from its bottom. âI think he will move more comfortably now,â he said, tipped his hat courteously to her and moved on.
âThese things, you see,â he said to a flummoxed Richard, âare easy. Sawing a lady in half is easy. Sawing a lady in half and then joining her up together again is less easy, but can be done with practice. The trick you described to me with the two-hundred-year-old vase and the college salt cellar is --â he paused for emphasis -- âcompletely and utterly inexplicable.â
âWell there was probably some detail of it I missed, but...ââOh, without question. But the benefit of questioning somebody under hypnosis is that it allows the questioner to see the scene in much greater detail than the subject was even aware of at the time. The girl Sarah, for instance. Do you recall what she was wearing?â
âEr, no,â said Richard, vaguely, âa dress of some kind, I suppose -- â âColour? Fabric?â
âWell, I canât remember, it was dark. She was sitting several places away from me. I hardly glimpsed her.â
âShe was wearing a dark blue cotton velvet dress gathered to a dropped waist. It had raglan sleeves gathered to the cuffs, a white Peter Pan collar and six small pearl buttons down the front -- the third one down had a small thread hanging off it. She had long dark hair pulled back with a red butterfly

hairgrip.â
âIf youâre going to tell me you know all that from looking at a scuff mark on my shoes, like Sherlock Holmes, then Iâm afraid I donât believe you.â
âNo, no,â said Dirk, âitâs much simpler than that. You told me yourself under hypnosis.â
Richard shook his head.
âNot true,â he said, âI donât even know what a Peter Pan collar is.ââBut I do and you described it to me perfectly accurately. As you did the conjuring trick. And that trick was not possible in the form in which it occurred. Believe me. I know whereof I speak. There are some other things I would like to discover about the Professor, like for instance who wrote the note you discovered on the table and how many questions George III actually asked, but --â
âWhat?â
â-- but I think I would do better to question the fellow directly. Except...â He frowned deeply in concentration. âExcept,â he added, âthat being rather vain in these matters I would prefer to know the answers before I asked the questions. And I do not. I absolutely do not.â He gazed abstractedly into the distance, and made a rough calculation of the remaining distance to the nearest lifebelt.
âAnd the second impossible thing,â he added, just as Richard was about to get a word in edgeways, âor at least, the next completely inexplicable thing, is of course the matter of your sofa.â
âDirk,â exclaimed Richard in exasperation, âmay I remind you that Gordon Way is dead, and that I appear to be under suspicion of his murder! None of these things have the remotest connection with that, and I --â
âBut I am extremely inclined to believe that they are connected.â âThatâs absurd!â

âI believe in the fundamental inter--â
âOh, yeah, yeah,â said Richard, âthe fundamental interconnectedness of all things. Listen, Dirk, I am not a gullible old lady and you wonât be getting any trips to Bermuda out of me. If youâre going to help me then letâs stick to the point.â
Dirk bridled at this. âI believe that all things are fundamentally interconnected, as anyonewho follows the principles of quantum mechanics to their logical extremes cannot, if they are honest, help but accept. But I also believe that some things are a great deal more interconnected than others. And when two apparently impossible events and a sequence of highly peculiar ones all occur to the same person, and when that person suddenly becomes the suspect of a highly peculiar murder, then it seems to me that we should look for the solution in the connection between these events. You are the connection, and you yourself have been behaving in a highly peculiar and eccentric way.â
âI have not,â said Richard. âYes, some odd things have happened to me, but I - -â
âYou were last night observed, by me, to climb the outside of a building and break into the flat of your girlfriend, Susan Way.â
âIt may have been unusual,â said Richard, âit may not even have been wise. But it was perfectly logical and rational. I just wanted to undo something I had done before it caused any damage.â
Dirk thought for a moment, and slightly quickened his pace.
âAnd what you did was a perfectly reasonable and normal response to the problem of the message you had left on the tape -- yes, you told me all about that in our little session -- itâs what anyone would have done?â
Richard frowned as if to say that he couldnât see what all the fuss was about. âI donât say anyone would have done it,â he said, âI probably have a slightly more logical and literal turn of mind than many people, which is why I can

write computer software. It was a logical and literal solution to the problem.â
âNot a little disproportionate, perhaps?â
âIt was very important to me not to disappoint Susan yet again.â
âSo you are absolutely satisfied with your own reasons for doing what you did?â
âYes,â insisted Richard angrily.
âDo you know,â said Dirk, âwhat my old maiden aunt who lived in Winnipeg used to tell me?â
âNo,â said Richard. He quickly took off all his clothes and dived into the canal. Dirk leapt for the lifebelt, with which they had just drawn level, yanked it out of its holder and flung it to Richard, who was floundering in the middle of the canal looking completely lost and disoriented.
âGrab hold of this,â shouted Dirk, âand Iâll haul you in.â âItâs all right,â spluttered Richard, âI can swim --â
âNo, you canât,â yelled Dirk, ânow grab it.â
Richard tried to strike out for the bank, but quickly gave up in consternation and grabbed hold of the lifebelt. Dirk pulled on the rope till Richard reached the edge, and then bent down to give him a hand out. Richard came up out of the water puffing and spitting, then turned and sat shivering on the edge with his hands in his lap.
âGod, itâs foul in there!â he exclaimed and spat again. âItâs absolutely disgusting. Yeuchh. Whew. God. Iâm usually a pretty good swimmer. Must have got some kind of cramp. Lucky coincidence we were so close to the lifebelt. Oh thanks.â This last he said in response to the large towel which Dirk handed him.

He rubbed himself down briskly, almost scraping himself with the towel to get the filthy canal water off him. He stood up and looked about. âCan you find my pants?â
âYoung man,â said the old lady with the dog, who had just reached them. She stood looking at them sternly, and was about to rebuke them when Dirk interrupted.
âA thousand apologies, dear lady,â he said, âfor any offence my friend may inadvertently have caused you. Please,â he added, drawing a slim bunch of anemones from Richardâs bottom, âaccept these with my compliments.â
The lady dashed them out of Dirkâs hand with her stick, and hurried off, horror- struck, yanking her dog after her.
âThat wasnât very nice of you,â said Richard, pulling on his clothes underneath the towel that was now draped strategically around him.
âI donât think sheâs a very nice woman,â replied Dirk, âsheâs always down here, yanking her poor dog around and telling people off. Enjoy your swim?â
âNot much, no,â said Richard, giving his hair a quick rub. âI hadnât realised how filthy it would be in there. And cold. Here,â he said, handing the towel back to Dirk, âthanks. Do you always carry a towel around in your briefcase?â
âDo you always go swimming in the afternoons?â
âNo, I usually go in the mornings, to the swimming pool on Highbury Fields, just to wake myself up, get the brain going. It just occurred to me I hadnât been this morning.â
âAnd, er -- that was why you just dived into the canal?â
âWell, yes. I just thought that getting a bit of exercise would probably help me deal with all this.â
âNot a little disproportionate, then, to strip off and jump into the canal.â

âNo,â he said, âit may not have been wise given the state of the water, but it was perfectly --â
âYou were perfectly satisfied with your own reasons for doing what you did.â
âYes --â
âAnd it was nothing to do with my aunt, then?â
Richardâs eyes narrowed suspiciously. âWhat on earth are you talking about?â he said.
âIâll tell you,â said Dirk. He went and sat on a nearby bench and opened his case again. He folded the towel away into it and took out instead a small Sony tape recorder. He beckoned Richard over and then pushed the Play button. Dirkâs own voice floated from the tiny speaker in a lilting singsong voice. It said, âIn a minute I will click my fingers and you will wake and forget all of this except for the instructions I shall now give you.
âIn a little while we will go for a walk along the canal, and when you hear me say the words âmy old maiden aunt who lived in Winnipegâ -- â
Dirk suddenly grabbed Richardâs arm to restrain him.
The tape continued, âYou will take off all your clothes and dive into the canal. You will find that you are unable to swim, but you will not panic or sink, you will simply tread water until I throw you the lifebelt...â
Dirk stopped the tape and looked round at Richardâs face which for the second time that day was pale with shock.
âI would be interested to know exactly what it was that possessed you to climb into Miss Wayâs flat last night,â said Dirk, âand why.â
Richard didnât respond -- he was continuing to stare at the tape recorder in some confusion. Then he said in a shaking voice, âThere was a message from

Gordon on Susanâs tape. He phoned from the car. The tapeâs in my flat. Dirk, Iâm suddenly very frightened by all this.â
CHAPTER 21
Dirk watched the police officer on duty outside Richardâs house from behind a van parked a few yards away. He had been stopping and questioning everyone who tried to enter the small side alley down which Richardâs door was situated, including, Dirk was pleased to note, other policemen if he didnât immediately recognise them. Another police car pulled up and Dirk started to move.
A police officer climbed out of the car carrying a saw and walked towards the doorway. Dirk briskly matched his pace with him, a step or two behind, striding authoritatively.
âItâs all right, heâs with me,â said Dirk, sweeping past at the exact moment that the one police officer stopped the other.
And he was inside and climbing the stairs.
The officer with the saw followed him in.
âEr, excuse me, sir,â he called up after Dirk.
Dirk had just reached the point where the sofa obstructed the stairway. He stopped and twisted round.
âStay here,â he said, âguard this sofa. Do not let anyone touch it, and I mean anyone. Understood?â
The officer seemed flummoxed for a moment. âIâve had orders to saw it up,â he said.

âCountermanded,â barked Dirk. âWatch it like a hawk. I shall want a full report.â
He turned back and climbed up over the thing. A moment or two later he emerged into a large open area. This was the lower of the two floors that comprised Richardâs flat.
âHave you searched that?â snapped Dirk at another officer who was sitting at Richardâs dining table looking through some notes. The officer looked up in surprise and started to stand up. Dirk was pointing at the wastepaper basket.
âEr, yes --â
âSearch it again. Keep searching it. Whoâs here?â
âEr, well --â
âI havenât got all day.â
âDetective Inspector Mason just left, with --â
âGood, Iâm having him pulled off. Iâll be upstairs if Iâm needed, but I donât wantany interruptions unless itâs very important. Understood?â
âEr, who --â
âI donât see you searching the wastepaper basket.â
âEr, right, sir. Iâll --â
âI want it deep-searched. You understand?â
âEr --â
âGet cracking.â Dirk swept on upstairs and into Richardâs workroom.The tape

was lying exactly where Richard had told him it would be, on the long desk on which the six Macintoshes sat. Dirk was about to pocket it when his curiosity was caught by the image of Richardâs sofa slowly twisting and turning on the big Macintosh screen, and he sat down at the keyboard.
He explored the program Richard had written for a short while, but quickly realised that in its present form it was less than self-explanatory and he learned little. He managed at last to get the sofa unstuck and move it back down the stairs, but he realised that he had had to turn part of the wall off in order to do it. With a grunt of irritation he gave up.
Another computer he looked at was displaying a steady sine wave. Around the edges of the screen were the small images of other waveforms which could be selected and added to the main one or used to modify it in other ways. He quickly discovered that this enabled you to build up very complex waveforms from simple ones and he played with this for a while. He added a simple sine wave to itself, which had the effect of doubling the height of the peaks and troughs of the wave. Then he slid one of the waves half a step back with respect to the other, and the peaks and troughs of one simply cancelled out the peaks and troughs of the other, leaving a completely flat line. Then he changed the frequency of one of the sine waves by a small extent.
The result of this was that at some positions along the combined waveform the two waves reinforced each other, and at others they cancelled each other out. Adding a third simple wave of yet another frequency resulted in a combined wave in which it was hard to see any pattern at all. The line danced up and down seemingly at random, staying quite low for some periods and then suddenly building into very large peaks and troughs as all three waves came briefly into phase with each other.
Dirk assumed that there must be amongst this array of equipment a means for translating the waveform dancing on the Macintosh screen into an actual musical tone and hunted among the menus available in the program. He found one menu item which invited him to transfer the wave sample into an Emu.
This puzzled him. He glanced around the room in search of a large flightless

bird, but was unable to locate any such thing. He activated the process anyway, and then traced the cable which led from the back of the Macintosh, down behind the desk, along the floor, behind a cupboard, under a rug until it fetched up plugged into the back of a large grey keyboard called an Emulator II.
This, he assumed, was where his experimental waveform has just arrived. Tentatively he pushed a key.
The nasty farting noise that surged instantly out of the speakers was so loud that for a moment he didnât hear the words âSvlad Cjelli!â that were barked simultaneously from the doorway.
Richard sat in Dirkâs office and threw tiny screwed-up balls of paper at the wastepaper bin which was already full of telephones. He broke pencils. He played major extracts from an old Ginger Baker solo on his knees.
In a word, he fretted.
He had been trying to write down on a piece of Dirkâs notepaper all that he could remember of the events of the previous evening and, as far as he could pinpoint them, the times at which each had occurred. He was astonished at how difficult it was, and how feeble his conscious memory seemed to be in comparison with his unconscious memory, as Dirk had demonstrated it to him.
âDamn Dirk,â he thought. He wanted to talk to Susan.
Dirk had told him he must not do so on any account as there would be a trace on the phone lines.
âDamn Dirk,â he said suddenly, and sprang to his feet.
âHave you got any ten-pence pieces?â he said to the resolutely glum Janice. Dirk turned.
Framed in the doorway stood a tall dark figure.

The tall dark figure appeared to be not at all happy with what it saw, to be rather cross about it, in fact. To be more than cross. It appeared to be a tall dark figure who could very easily yank the heads off half a dozen chickens and still be cross at the end of it.
It stepped forward into the light and revealed itself to be Sergeant Gilks of the Cambridgeshire Constabulary.
âDoyouknow,â said SergeantGilksof theCambridgeshire Constabulary, blinking with suppressed emotion, âthat when I arrive back here to discover one police officer guarding a sofa with a saw and another dismembering an innocent wastepaper basket I have to ask myself certain questions? And I have to ask them with the disquieting sense that I am not going to like the answers when I find them.
âI then find myself mounting the stairs with a horrible premonition, Svlad Cjelli, a very horrible premonition indeed. A premonition, I might add, that I now find horribly justified. I suppose you canât shed any light on a horse discovered in a bathroom as well? That seemed to have an air of you about it.â
âI cannot,â said Dirk, âas yet. Though it interests me strangely.â
âI should think it bloody did. It would have interested you strangely if youâd had to get the bloody thing down a bloody winding staircase at one oâclock in the morning as well. What the hell are you doing here?â said Sergeant Gilks, wearily.
âI am here,â said Dirk, âin pursuit of justice.â
âWell, I wouldnât mix with me then,â said Gilks, âand I certainly wouldnât mix with the Met. What do you know of MacDuff and Way?â
âOf Way? Nothing beyond what is common knowledge. MacDuff I knew at Cambridge.â
âOh, you did, did you? Describe him.â

âTall. Tall and absurdly thin. And good-natured. A bit like a preying mantis that doesnât prey -- a non-preying mantis if you like. A sort of pleasant genial mantis thatâs given up preying and taken up tennis instead.â
âHmm,â said Gilks gruffly, turning away and looking about the room. Dirk pocketed the tape.
âSounds like the same one,â said Gilks.
âAnd of course,â said Dirk, âcompletely incapable of murder.â
âThatâs for us to decide.â
âAnd of course a jury.â
âTchah! Juries!â
âThough, of course, it will not come to that, since the facts will speak for themselves long before it comes to a court of law for my client.â
âYour bleeding client, eh? All right, Cjelli, where is he?â âI havenât the faintest idea.â
âIâll bet youâve got a billing address.â
Dirk shrugged.
âLook, Cjelli, this is a perfectly normal, harmless murder enquiry, and I donât want you mucking it up. So consider yourself warned off as of now. If I see a single piece of evidence being levitated Iâll hit you so hard you wonât know if itâs tomorrow or Thursday. Now get out, and give me that tape on the way.â He held out his hand.
Dirk blinked, genuinely surprised. âWhat tape?â
Gilks sighed. âYouâre a clever man, Cjelli, I grant you that,â he said, âbut you

make the same mistake a lot of clever people do of thinking everyone else is stupid. If I turn away itâs for a reason, and the reason was to see what you picked up. I didnât need to see you pick it up, I just had to see what was missing afterwards. We are trained you know. We used to get half an hour Observation Training on Tuesday afternoons. Just as a break after four
hours solid of Senseless Brutality.â
Dirk hid his anger with himself behind a light smile. He fished in the pocket of his leather overcoat and handed over the tape.
âPlay it,â said Gilks, âletâs see what you didnât want us to hear.ââIt wasnât that I didnât want you to hear it,â said Dirk, with a shrug. âI just wanted to hear it first.â He went over to the shelf which carried Richardâs hi-fi equipment and slipped the tape into the cassette player.
âSo do you want to give me a little introduction?â
âItâs a tape,â said Dirk, âfrom Susan Wayâs telephone answering machine. Way apparently had this habit of leaving long...â
âYeah, I know about that. And his secretary goes round picking up his prattlings in the morning, poor devil.â
âWell, I believe there may be a message on the tape from Gordon Wayâs car last night.â
âI see. OK. Play it.â
With a gracious bow Dirk pressed the Play button.
âOh, Susan, hi, itâs Gordon,â said the tape once again. âJust on my way to the cottage --â
âCottage!â exclaimed Gilks, satirically.
âItâs, er, Thursday night, and itâs, er... 8.47. Bit misty on the roads. Listen, I have those people from the States coming over this weekend...â

Gilks raised his eyebrows, looked at his watch, and made a note on his pad.
Both Dirk and the police sergeant experienced a chill as the dead manâs voice filled the room.
â-- itâs a wonder I donât end up dead in the ditch, that would be something wouldnât it, leaving your famous last words on somebodyâs answering machine, thereâs no reason --â
They listened in a tense silence as the tape played on through the entire message.
âThatâs the problem with crunch-heads -- they have one great idea that actually works and then they expect you to carry on funding them for years while they sit and calculate the topographies of their navels. Iâm sorry, Iâm going to have to stop and close the boot properly. Wonât be a moment.â
Next came the muffled bump of the telephone receiver being dropped on the passenger seat, and a few seconds later the sound of the car door being opened. In the meantime, the music from the carâs sound system could be heard burbling away in the background.
A fewseconds laterstillcamethe distant, muffled, but unmistakable double blam of a shotgun.
âStop the tape,â said Gilks sharply and glanced at his watch. âThree minutes and twenty-five seconds since he said it was 8.47.â He glanced up at Dirk again. âStay here. Donât move. Donât touch anything. Iâve made a note of the position of every particle of air in this room, so I shall know if youâve been breathing.â
He turned smartly and left. Dirk heard him saying as he went down the stairs, âTuckett, get on to WayForwardâs office, get the details of Wayâs carphone, what number, which network...â The voice faded away downstairs.
Quickly Dirk twisted down the volume control on the hi-fi, and resumed playing the tape.

The music continued for a while. Dirk drummed his fingers in frustration. Still the music continued.
He flicked the Fast Forward button for just a moment. Still music. It occurred to him that he was looking for something, but that he didnât know what. That thought stopped him in his tracks.
He was very definitely looking for something. He very definitely didnât know what.
The realisation that he didnât know exactly why he was doing what he was doing suddenly chilled and electrified him. He turned slowly like a fridge door opening.
There was no one there, at least no one that he could see. But he knew the chill prickling through his skin and detested it above all things.
He said in a low savage whisper, âIf anyone can hear me, hear this. My mindis my centre and everything that happens there is my responsibility. Other people may believe what it pleases them to believe, but I will do nothing without I know the reason why and know it clearly. If you want something then let me know, but do not you dare touch my mind.â
He was trembling with a deep and old rage. The chill dropped slowly and almost pathetically from him and seemed to move off into the room. He tried to follow it with his senses, but was instantly distracted by a sudden voice that seemed to come at him on the edge of his hearing, on a distant howl of wind.
It was a hollow, terrified, bewildered voice, no more than an insubstantial whisper, but it was there, audible, on the telephone-answering machine tape.
It said, âSusan! Susan, help me! Help me for Godâs sake. Susan, Iâm dead --â Dirk whirled round and stopped the tape.

âIâm sorry,â he said under his breath, âbut I have the welfare of my client to consider.â
He wound the tape back a very short distance, to just before where the voice began, twisted the Record Level knob to zero and pressed Record. He left the tape to run, wiping off the voice and anything that might follow it. If the tape was going to establish the time of Gordon Wayâs death, then Dirk didnât want any embarrassing examples of Gordon speaking to turn up on the tape after that point, even if it was only to confirm that he was, in fact, dead.
There seemed to be a great eruption of emotion in the air near to him. A wave of something surged through the room, causing the furniture to flutter in its wake. Dirk watched where it seemed to go, towards a shelf near the door on which, he suddenly realised, stood Richardâs own telephone-answering machine. The machine started to jiggle fitfully where it sat, but then sat still as Dirk approached it. Dirk reached out slowly and calmly and pushed the button which set the machine to Answer.
The disturbance in the air then passed back through the room to Richardâs long desk where two old-fashioned rotary-dial telephones nestled among the piles of paper and micro floppy disks. Dirk guessed what would happen, but elected to watch rather than to intervene.
One of the telephone receivers toppled off its cradle. Dirk could hear the dialling tone. Then, slowly and with obvious difficulty, the dial began to turn. It moved unevenly round, further round, slower and slower, and then suddenly slipped back.
There was a momentâs pause. Then the receiver rests went down and up again to get a new dialling tone. The dial began to turn again, but creaking even more fitfully than the last time.
Again it slipped back.
There was a longer pause this time, and then the entire process was repeated once more.

When the dial slipped back a third time there was a sudden explosion of fury -- the whole phone leapt into the air and hurtled across the room. The receiver
cord wrapped itself round an Anglepoise lamp on the way and brought it crashing down in a tangle of cables, coffee cups and floppy disks. A pile of books erupted off the desk and on to the floor.The figure of Sergeant Gilks stood stony-faced in the doorway.
âIâm going to come in again,â he said, âand when I do, I donât want to see anything of that kind going on whatsoever. Is that understood?â He turned and disappeared.
Dirk leapt for the cassette player and hit the Rewind button. Then he turned and hissed at the empty air, âI donât know who you are, but I can guess. If you want my help, donât you ever embarrass me like that again!â
A few moments later, Gilks walked in again. âAh, there you are,â he said.
He surveyed the wreckage with an even gaze. âIâll pretend I canât see any of this, so that I wonât have to ask any questions the answers to which would, I know, only irritate me.â
Dirk glowered.
In the moment or two of silence that followed, a slight ticking whirr could be heard which caused the sergeant to look sharply at the cassette player.
âWhatâs that tape doing?â
âRewinding.â
âGive it to me.â
The tape reached the beginning and stopped as Dirk reached it. He took it out and handed it to Gilks.
âIrritatingly, this seems to put your client completely in the clear,â said the sergeant. âCellnet have confirmed that the last call made from the car was at

8.46 pm last night, at which point your client was lightly dozing in front of several hundred witnesses. I say witnesses, in fact they were mostly students, but we will probably be forced to assume that they canât all be lying.â
âGood,â said Dirk, âwell, Iâm glad thatâs all cleared up.â
âWe never thought he had actually done it, of course. Simply didnât fit. But you know us -- we like to get results. Tell him we still want to ask him some questions, though.â
âI shall be sure to mention it if I happen to run into him.â âYou just do that little thing.â
âWell, I shanât detain you any longer, Sergeant,â said Dirk, airily waving at the door.
âNo, but I shall bloody detain you if youâre not out of here in thirty seconds, Cjelli. I donât know what youâre up to, but if I can possibly avoid finding out I shall sleep easier in my office. Out.â
âThen I shall bid you good day, Sergeant. I wonât say itâs been a pleasure because it hasnât.â
Dirk swept out of the room, and made his way out of the flat, noting with sorrow that where there had been a large chesterfield sofa wedged magnificently in the staircase, there was now just a small, sad pile of sawdust.
With a jerk Michael Wenton-Weakes looked up from his book.
Hismind suddenly was alive with purpose.Thoughts, images, memories, intentions, all crowded in upon him, and the more they seemed to contradict each other the more they seemed to fit together, to pair and settle.
The match at last was perfect, the teeth of one slowly aligned with the teeth of another.

A pull and they were zipped.
Though the waiting had seemed an eternity of eternities when it was filled with failure, with fading waves of weakness, with feeble groping and lonely impotence, the match once made cancelled it all. Would cancel it all. Would undo what had been so disastrously done.
Who thought that? It did not matter, the match was made, the match was perfect.
Michael gazed out of the window across the well-manicured Chelsea street and did not care whether what he saw were slimy things with legs or whether they were all Mr A. K. Ross. What mattered was what they had stolen and what they would be compelled to return. Ross now lay in the past. What he was now concerned with lay still further in it.
His large soft cowlike eyes returned to the last few lines of âKubla Khanâ, which he had just been reading. The match was made, the zip was pulled.
He closed the book and put it in his pocket.
His path back now was clear. He knew what he must do. It only remained to do a little shopping and then do it.
CHAPTER 22
âYou? Wanted for murder? Richard what are you talking about?â
The telephone wavered in Richardâs hand. He was holding it about half an inch away from his ear anyway because it seemed that somebody had dipped the earpiece in some chow mein recently, but that wasnât so bad. This was a public telephone so it was clearly an oversight that it was working at all. But Richard was beginning to feel as if the whole world had shifted about half an inch away from him, like someone in a deodorant commercial.

âGordon,â said Richard, hesitantly, âGordonâs been murdered -- hasnât he?â Susan paused before she answered.
âYes, Richard,â she said in a distressed voice, âbut no one thinks you did it. They want to question you of course, but --â
âSo there are no police with you now?â
âNo, Richard,â insisted Susan, âLook, why donât you come here?â
âAnd theyâre not out searching for me?â
âNo! Where on earth did you get the idea that you were wanted for -- that they thought you had done it?â
âEr -- well, this friend of mine told me.â
âWho?â
âWell, his name is Dirk Gently.â
âYouâve never mentioned him. Who is he? Did he say anything else?â
âHe hypnotised me and, er, made me jump in the canal, and, er, well, that was it really --â
There was a terribly long pause at the other end.
âRichard,â said Susan at last with the sort of calmness that comes over people when they realise that however bad things may seem to be, there is absolutely no reason why they shouldnât simply get worse and worse, âcome over here. I was going to say I need to see you, but I think you need to see me.â
âI should probably go to the police.â

âGo to the police later. Richard, please. A few hours wonât make any difference. I... I can hardly even think. Richard, itâs so awful. It would just help if you were here. Where are you?â
âOK,â said Richard, âIâll be with you in about twenty minutes.â
âShall I leave the window open or would you like to try the door?â she said with a sniff.
CHAPTER 23
âNo, please,â said Dirk, restraining Miss Pearceâs hand from opening a letter from the Inland Revenue, âthere are wilder skies than these.âHe had emerged from a spell of tense brooding in his darkened office and there was an air of excited concentration about him. It had taken his actual signature on an actual salary cheque to persuade Miss Pearce to forgive him for the latest unwarrantable extravagance with which he had returned to the office and he felt that just to sit there blatantly opening letters from the taxman was to take his magnanimous gesture in entirely the wrong spirit.
She put the envelope aside.
âCome!â he said. âI have something I wish you to see. I shall observe your reactions with the very greatest of interest.â
He bustled back into his own office and sat at his desk.
She followed him in patiently and sat opposite, pointedly ignoring the new unwarrantable extravagance sitting on the desk.
The flashy brass plaque for the door had stirred her up pretty badly but the silly phone with big red push buttons she regarded as being beneath contempt. And she certainly wasnât going to do anything rash like smile until she knew for certain that the cheque wouldnât bounce. The last time he signed a cheque

for her he cancelled it before the end of the day, to prevent it, as he explained, âfalling into the wrong handsâ. The wrong hands presumably, being those of her bank manager.
He thrust a piece of paper across the desk.
She picked it up and looked at it. Then she turned it round and looked at it again. She looked at the other side and then she put it down.
âWell?â demanded Dirk. âWhat do you make of it? Tell me!â Miss Pearce sighed.
âItâs a lot of meaningless squiggles done in blue felt tip on a piece of typing paper,â she said. âIt looks like you did them yourself.â
âNo!â barked Dirk, âWell, yes,â he admitted, âbut only because I believe that it is the answer to the problem!â
âWhat problem?â
âThe problem,â insisted Dirk, slapping the table, âof the conjuring trick! I told you!â
âYes, Mr Gently, several times. I think it was just a conjuring trick. You see them on the telly.â
âWith this difference -- that this one was completely impossible!â
âCouldnât have been impossible or he wouldnât have done it. Stands to reason.â
âExactly!â said Dirk excitedly. âExactly! Miss Pearce, you are a lady of rare perception and insight.â
âThank you, sir, can I go now?â

âWait! I havenât finished yet! Not by a long way, not by a bucketful! You have demonstrated to me the depth of your perception and insight, allow me to demonstrate mine!â
Miss Pearce slumped patiently in her seat.
âI think,â said Dirk, âyou will be impressed. Consider this. An intractable problem. In trying to find the solution to it I was going round and round in little circles in my mind, over and over the same maddening things. Clearly I wasnât going to be able to think of anything else until I had the answer, but equally clearly I would have to think of something else if I was ever going to get the answer. How to break this circle? Ask me how.â
âHow?â said Miss Pearce obediently, but without enthusiasm.
âBy writing down what the answer is!â exclaimed Dirk. âAnd here it is!â He slapped the piece of paper triumphantly and sat back with a satisfied smile.
Miss Pearce looked at it dumbly.
âWith the result,â continued Dirk, âthat I am now able to turn my mind to fresh and intriguing problems, like, for instance...â
He took the piece of paper, covered with its aimless squiggles and doodlings, and held it up to her.
âWhat language,â he said in a low, dark voice, âis this written in?âMiss Pearce continued to look at it dumbly.
Dirk flung the piece of paper down, put his feet up on the table, and threw his head back with his hands behind it.
âYou see what I have done?â he asked the ceiling, which seemed to flinch slightly at being yanked so suddenly into the conversation. âI have transformed the problem from an intractably difficult and possibly quite insoluble conundrum into a mere linguistic puzzle. Albeit,â he muttered, after a long moment of silent pondering, âan intractably difficult and possibly insoluble

one.â
He swung back to gaze intently at Janice Pearce.
âGo on,â he urged, âsay that itâs insane -- but it might just work!âJanice Pearce cleared her throat.
âItâs insane,â she said, âtrust me.â
Dirk turned away and sagged sideways off his chair, much as the sitter for The Thinker probably did when Rodin went off to be excused.He suddenly looked profoundly tired and depressed.
âI know,â he said in a low, dispirited voice, âthat there is something profoundly wrong somewhere. And I know that I must go to Cambridge to put it right. But I would feel less fearful if I knew what it was...â
âCan I get on now, please, then?â said Miss Pearce. Dirk looked up at her glumly.
âYes,â he said with a sigh, âbut just -- just tell me --â he flicked at the piece of paper with his fingertips -- âwhat do you think of this, then?â
âWell, I think itâs childish,â said Janice Pearce, frankly.
âBut -- but -- but!â said Dirk thumping the table in frustration. âDonât you understand that we need to be childish in order to understand? Only a child sees things with perfect clarity, because it hasnât developed all those filters which prevent us from seeing things that we donât expect to see?â
âThen why donât you go and ask one?â
âThank you, Miss Pearce,â said Dirk reaching for his hat, âonce again you have rendered me an inestimable service for which I am profoundly grateful.â

He swept out.
CHAPTER 24
The weather began to bleaken as Richard made his way to Susanâs flat. The sky which had started out with such verve and spirit in the morning was beginning to lose its concentration and slip back into its normal English condition, that of a damp and rancid dish cloth. Richard took a taxi, which got him there in a few minutes.
âThey should all be deported,â said the taxi driver as they drew to a halt.
âEr, who should?â said Richard, who realisedhe hadnât been listening to a word the driver said.
âEr --âsaid the driver, who suddenly realised he hadnât been listening either, âer, the whole lot of them. Get rid of the whole bloody lot, thatâs what I say. And their bloody newts,â he added for good measure.
âExpect youâre right,â said Richard, and hurried into the house.
Arriving at the front door of her flat he could hear from within the sounds of Susanâs cello playing a slow, stately melody. He was glad of that, that she was playing. She had an amazingemotional self sufficiency and control provided she could play her cello. He had noticed an odd and extraordinary thing about her relationship with the music she played. If ever she was feeling emotional or upset she could sit and play some music with utter concentration and emerge seeming fresh and calm.The next time she played the same music, however, it would all burst from her and she would go completely to pieces.
He let himself in as quietly as possible so as not to disturb her concentration.
He tiptoed past the small room she practised in, but the door was open so he paused and looked at her, with the slightest of signals that she shouldnât stop.

She was looking pale and drawn but gave him a flicker of a smile and continued bowing with a sudden intensity.
With an impeccable timing of which it is very rarely capable the sun chose that moment to burst briefly through the gathering rainclouds, and as she played her cello a stormy light played on her and on the deep old brown of the wood of the instrument. Richard stood transfixed. The turmoil of the day stood still for a moment and kept a respectful distance.
He didnât know the music, but it sounded like Mozart and he remembered her saying she had some Mozart to learn. He walked quietly on and sat down to wait and listen.
Eventually she finished the piece, and there was about a minute of silence before she came through. She blinked and smiled and gave him a long, trembling hug, then released herself and put the phone back on the hook. It usually got taken off when she was practising.
âSorry,â she said, âI didnât want to stop.â She briskly brushed away a tear as if it was a slight irritation. âHow are you Richard?â
He shrugged and gave her a bewildered look. That seemed about to cover it.
âAnd Iâm going to have to carry on, Iâm afraid,â said Susan with a sigh âIâm sorry. Iâve just been...â She shook her head. âWho would do it?â
âI donât know. Some madman. Iâm not sure that it matters who.â âNo,â she said. âLook, er, have you had any lunch?â
âNo. Susan, you keep playing and Iâll see whatâs in the fridge. We can talk about it all over some lunch.â
Susan nodded.
âAll right,â she said, âexcept...â

âYes?â
âWell, just for the moment I donât really want to talk about Gordon. Just till it sinks in. I feel sort of caught out. It would be easier if Iâd been closer to him, but I wasnât and Iâm sort of embarrassed by not having a reaction ready. Talking about it would be all right except that you have to use the past tense and thatâs whatâs...â
She clung to him for a moment and then quieted herself with a sigh.âThereâs not much in the fridge at the moment,â she said, âsome yoghurt, I think, and a jar of roll-mop herrings you could open. Iâm sure youâll be able to muck it up if you try, but itâs actually quite straightforward. The main trick is not to throw them all over the floor or get jam on them.â
She gave him a hug, a kiss and a glum smile and then retreated back to her music room.
The phone rang and Richard answered it.
âHello?â he said. There was nothing, just a faint sort of windy noise on the line.
âHello?â he said again, waited, shrugged and put the phone back down.
âWas there anybody there?â called Susan.
âNo, no one,â said Richard.
âThatâs happened a couple of times,â said Susan. âI think itâs a sort of minimalist heavy breather.â She resumed playing.
Richard went into the kitchen and opened the fridge. He was less of a health- conscious eater than Susan and was therefore less than thrilled by what he found there, but he managed to put some roll-mop herrings, some yoghurt, some rice and some oranges on a tray without difficulty and tried not to think that a couple of fat hamburgers and fries would round it off nicely.

He found a bottle of white wine and carried it all through to the small dining table.
After a minute or two Susan joined him there. She was at her most calm and composed, and after a few mouthsful she asked him about the canal.
Richard shook his head in bemusement and tried to explain about it, and about Dirk.
âWhat did you say his name was?â said Susan with a frown when he had come, rather lamely, to a conclusion.
âItâs, er, Dirk Gently,â said Richard, âin a way.â âIn a way?â
âEr, yes,â said Richard with a difficult sigh. He reflected that just about anything you could say about Dirk was subject to these kind of vague and shifty qualifications. There was even, on his letter heading, a string of vague and shifty-looking qualifications after his name. He pulled out the piece of paper on which he had vainly been trying to organise his thoughts earlier in the day.
âI...â he started, but the doorbell rang. They looked at each other.âIf itâs the police,â said Richard, âIâd better see them. Letâs get it over with.â
Susan pushed back her chair, went to the front door and picked up the Entryphone.
âHello?â she said.
âWho?â she said after a moment. She frowned as she listened then swung round and frowned at Richard.
âYouâd better come up,â she said in a less than friendly tone of voice and then pressed the button. She came back and sat down.

âYour friend,â she said evenly, âMr Gently.â
The Electric Monkâs day was going tremendously well and he broke into an excited gallop. That is to say that, excitedly, he spurred his horse to a gallop and, unexcitedly, his horse broke into it.
This world, the Monk thought, was a good one. He loved it. He didnât know whose it was or where it had come from, but it was certainly a deeply fulfilling place for someone with his unique and extraordinary gifts.
He was appreciated. All day he had gone up to people, fallen into conversation with them, listened to their troubles, and then quietly uttered those three magic words, âI believe you.â
The effect had invariably been electrifying. It wasnât that people on this world didnât occasionally say it to each other, but they rarely, it seemed,
managed to achieve that deep timbre of sincerity which the Monk had been so superbly programmed to reproduce.
On his own world, after all, he was taken for granted. People would just expect him to get on and believe things for them without bothering them. Someone would come to the door with some great new idea or proposal or even a
new religion, and the answer would be âOh, go and tell that to the Monk.â And the Monk would sit and listen and patiently believe it all, but no one would take any further interest.
Only one problem seemed to arise on this otherwise excellent world. Often, after he had uttered the magic words, the subject would rapidly change to that of money, and the Monk of course didnât have any -- a shortcoming that had quickly blighted a number of otherwise very promising encounters.
Perhaps he should acquire some -- but where?
He reined his horse in for a moment, and the horse jerked gratefully to a halt and started in on the grass on the roadside verge. The horse had no idea what all this galloping up and down was in aid of, and didnât care. All it did care about was that it was being made to gallop up and down past a seemingly

perpetual roadside buffet. It made the best of its moment while it had it.
The Monk peered keenly up and down the road. It seemed vaguely familiar. He trotted a little further up it for another look. The horse resumed its meal a few yards further along.
Yes. The Monk had been here last night.
He remembered it clearly, well, sort of clearly. He believed that he remembered it clearly, and that, after all, was the main thing. Here was where he had walked to in a more than usually confused state of mind, and just around the very next corner, if he was not very much mistaken, again, lay the small roadside establishment at which he had jumped into the back of that nice manâs car -- the nice man who had subsequently reacted so oddly to being shot at.
Perhaps they would have some money there and would let him have it. He wondered. Well, he would find out. He yanked the horse from its feast once again and galloped towards it.
As he approached the petrol station he noticed a car parked there at an arrogant angle. The angle made it quite clear that the car was not there for anything so mundane as to have petrol put into it, and was much too important to park itself neatly out of the way. Any other car that arrived for petrol would just have to manoeuvre around it as best it could. The car was white with stripes and badges and important looking lights.
Arriving at the forecourt the Monk dismounted and tethered his horse to a pump. He walked towards the small shop building and saw that inside it there was a man with his back to him wearing a dark blue uniform and a peaked cap. The man was dancing up and down and twisting his fingers in his ears, and this was clearly making a deep impression on the man behind the till.
The Monk watched in transfixed awe. The man, he believed with an instant effortlessness which would have impressed even a Scientologist, must be a God of some kind to arouse such fervour. He waited with bated breath to worship him. In a moment the man turned around and walked out of the shop, saw the

Monk and stopped dead.
The Monk realised that the God must be waiting for him to make an act of worship, so he reverently danced up and down twisting his fingers in his ears.
His God stared at him for a moment, caught hold of him, twisted him round, slammed him forward spreadeagled over the car and frisked him for weapons.
Dirk burst into the flat like a small podgy tornado.
âMiss Way,â he said, grasping her slightly unwilling hand and doffing his absurd hat, âit is the most inexpressible pleasure to meet you, but also the matter of the deepest regret that the occasion of our meeting should be one of such great sorrow and one which bids me extend to you my most profound sympathy and commiseration. I ask you to believe me that I would not intrude upon your private grief for all the world if it were not on a matter of the gravest moment and magnitude. Richard -- I have solved the problem of the conjuring trick and itâs extraordinary.â
He swept through the room and deposited himself on a spare chair at the small dining table, on which he put his hat.
âYou will have to excuse us, Dirk --â said Richard, coldly.
âNo, I am afraid you will have to excuse me,â returned Dirk. âThe puzzle is solved, and the solution is so astounding that it took a seven-year-old child on the street to give it to me. But it is undoubtedly the correct one, absolutely undoubtedly. âWhat, then, is the solution?â you ask me, or rather would ask me if you could get a word in edgeways, which you canât, so I will save you the bother and ask the question for you, and answer it as well by saying that I will not tell you, because you wonât believe me. I shall instead show you, this very afternoon.
âRest assured, however, that it explains everything. It explains the trick. It explains the note you found -- that should have made it perfectly clear to
me but I was a fool. And it explains what the missing third question was, or

rather -- and this is the significant point -- it explains what the missing first question was!â
âWhat missing question?â exclaimed Richard, confused by the sudden pause, and leaping in with the first phrase he could grab.
Dirk blinked as if at an idiot. âThe missing question that George III asked, of course,â he said.
âAsked who?â
âWell, the Professor,â said Dirk impatiently. âDonât you listen to anything you say? The whole thing was obvious!â he exclaimed, thumping the table, âSo obvious that the only thing which prevented me from seeing the solution was the trifling fact that it was completely impossible. Sherlock Holmes observed that once you have eliminated the impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the answer. I, however, do not like to eliminate the impossible. Now. Let us go.â
âNo.â
âWhat?â Dirk glanced up at Susan, from whom this unexpected -- or at least, unexpected to him -- opposition had come.
âMr Gently,â said Susan in a voice you could notch a stick with, âwhy did you deliberately mislead Richard into thinking that he was wanted by the police?â
Dirk frowned.
âBut he was wanted by the police,â he said, âand still is.â
âYes, but just to answer questions! Not because heâs a suspected murderer.â Dirk looked down.
âMiss Way,â he said, âthe police are interested in knowing who murdered

your brother. I, with the very greatest respect, am not. It may, I concede, turn out to have a bearing on the case, but it may just as likely turn out to be a casual madman. I wanted to know, still need desperately to know, why Richard climbed into this flat last night.ââI told you,â protested Richard.
âWhat you told me is immaterial -- it only reveals the crucial fact that you do not know the reason yourself! For heavenâs sake I thought I had demonstrated that to you clearly enough at the canal!â
Richard simmered.
âIt was perfectly clear to me watching you,â pursued Dirk, âthat you had very little idea what you were doing, and had absolutely no concern about the physical danger you were in. At first I thought, watching, that it was just a brainless thug out on his first and quite possibly last burgle. But then the figure looked back and I realised it was you -- and I know you to be an intelligent, rational, and moderate man. Richard MacDuff? Risking his neck carelessly climbing up drainpipes at night? It seemed to me that you would only behave in such a reckless and extreme way if you were desperately worried about something of terrible importance. Is that not true, Miss Way?â
He looked sharply up at Susan, who slowly sat down, looking at him with an alarm in her eyes which said that he had struck home.
âAnd yet, when you came to see me this morning you seemed perfectly calm and collected. You argued with me perfectly rationally when I talked a lot of nonsense about SchrÃ¶dingerâs Cat. This was not the behaviour of someone who had the previous night been driven to extremes by some desperate purpose. I confess that it was at that moment that I stooped to, well, exaggerating your predicament, simply in order to keep hold of you.â
âYou didnât. I left.â
âWith certain ideas in your head. I knew you would be back. I apologise most humbly for having misled you, er, somewhat, but I knew that what I had to find out lay far beyond what the police would concern themselves with. And it was this -- if you were not quite yourself when you climbed the wall

last night... then who were you, -- and why?â
Richard shivered. A silence lengthened.
âWhat has it got to do with conjuring tricks?â he said at last.
âThat is what we must go to Cambridge to find out.â
âBut what makes you so sure -- ?â
âIt disturbs me,â said Dirk, and a dark and heavy look came into his face. For one so garrulous he seemed suddenly oddly reluctant to speak.
He continued, âIt disturbs me very greatly when I find that I know things and do not know why I know them. Maybe it is the same instinctive processing of data that allows you to catch a ball almost before youâve seen it. Maybe
it is the deeper and less explicable instinct that tells you when someone is watching you. It is a very great offence to my intellect that the very things that I despise other people for being credulous of actually occur to me. You will remember the... unhappiness surrounding certain exam questions.â
He seemed suddenly distressed and haggard. He had to dig deep inside himself to continue speaking.
He said, âThe ability to put two and two together and come up instantly with four is one thing. The ability to put the square root of five hundred and thirty-nine point seven together with the cosine of twenty-six point four three two and come up with... with whatever the answer to that is, is quite another. And I... well, let me give you an example.â
He leant forward intently. âLast night I saw you climbing into this flat. I knew that something was wrong. Today I got you to tell me every last detail you knew about what happened last night, and already, as a result, using my intellect alone, I have uncovered possibly the greatest secret lying hidden on this planet. I swear to you that this is true and that I can prove it. Now you must believe me when I tell you that I know, I know that there is something

terribly, desperately, appallingly wrong and that we must find it. Will you go with me now, to Cambridge?â
Richard nodded dumbly.
âGood,â said Dirk. âWhat is this?â he added, pointing at Richardâs plate. âA pickled herring. Do you want one?â
âThank you, no,â said Dirk, rising and buckling his coat. âThere is,â he added as he headed towards the door, steering Richard with him, âno such word as âherringâ in my dictionary. Good afternoon, Miss Way, wish us God speed.â
CHAPTER 25
There was a rumble of thunder, and the onset of that interminable tight drizzle from the north-east by which so many of the worldâs most momentous events seem to be accompanied.
Dirk turned up the collar of his leather overcoat against the weather, but nothing could dampen his demonic exuberance as he and Richard approached the great twelfth-century gates.
âSt Ceddâs College, Cambridge,â he exclaimed, looking at them for the first time in eight years. âFounded in the year something or other, by someone I forget in honour of someone whose name for the moment escapes me.â
âSt Cedd?â suggested Richard.
âDo you know, I think it very probably was? One of the duller Northumbrian saints. His brother Chad was even duller. Has a cathedral in Birmingham if that gives you some idea. Ah, Bill, how good to see you again,â he added, accosting the porter who was just walking into the college as well. The porter looked round.

âMr Cjelli, nice to see you back, sir. Sorry you had a spot of bother, hope thatâs all behind you now.â
âIndeed, Bill, it is. You find me thriving. And Mrs Roberts? How is she? Foot still troubling her?â
âNot since she had it off, thanks for asking, sir. Between you and me, sir, I wouldâve been just as happy to have had her amputated and kept the foot. I had a little spot reserved on the mantelpiece, but there we are, we have to take things as we find them.
âMr MacDuff, sir,â he added, nodding curtly at Richard. âOh that horse you mentioned, sir, when you were here last night, Iâm afraid we had to have it removed. It was bothering Professor Chronotis.â
âI was only curious, er, Bill,â said Richard. âI hope it didnât disturb you.â
âNothing ever disturbs me, sir, so long as it isnât wearing a dress. Canât abide it when the young fellers wear dresses, sir.â
âIf the horse bothers you again, Bill,â interrupted Dirk, patting him on the shoulder, âsend it up to me and I shall speak with it. Now, you mention the good Professor Chronotis. Is he in at the moment? Weâve come on an errand.â
âFar as I know, sir. Canât check for you because his phoneâs out of order. Suggest you go and look yourself. Far left corner of Second Court.â
âI know it well, Bill, thank you, and my best to what remains of Mrs Roberts.â
They swept on through into First Court, or at least Dirk swept, and Richard walked in his normal heron-like gait, wrinkling up his face against the measly drizzle.
Dirk had obviously mistaken himself for a tour guide.
âSt Ceddâs,â he pronounced, âthe college of Coleridge, and the college of

Sir Isaac Newton, renowned inventor of the milled-edge coin and the catflap!â âThe what?â said Richard.
âThe catflap! A device of the utmost cunning, perspicuity and invention. It is a door within a door, you see, a...â
âYes,â said Richard, âthere was also the small matter of gravity.â
âGravity,â said Dirk with a slightly dismissive shrug, âyes, there was that as well, I suppose. Though that, of course, was merely a discovery. It was there to be discovered.â
He took a penny out of his pocket and tossed it casually on to the pebbles that ran alongside the paved pathway.
âYou see?â he said, âThey even keep it on at weekends. Someone was bound to notice sooner or later. But the catflap... ah, there is a very different matter. Invention, pure creative invention.â
âI would have thought it was quite obvious. Anyone could have thought of it.â
âAh,â said Dirk, âit is a rare mind indeed that can render the hitherto non- existent blindingly obvious. The cry âI could have thought of thatâ is a very popular and misleading one, for the fact is that they didnât, and a very significant and revealing fact it is too. This if I am not mistaken is the staircase we seek. Shall we ascend?â
Without waiting for an answer he plunged on up the stairs. Richard, following uncertainly, found him already knocking on the inner door. The outer one stood open.
âCome in!â called a voice from within. Dirk pushed the door open, and they were just in time to see the back of Regâs white head as he disappeared into the kitchen.

âJust making some tea,â he called out. âLike some? Sit down, sit down, whoever you are.â
âThat would be most kind,â returned Dirk. âWe are two.â Dirk sat, and Richard followed his lead.
âIndian or China?â called Reg. âIndian, please.â
There was a rattle of cups and saucers.
Richard looked around the room. It seemed suddenly humdrum. The fire was burning quietly away to itself, but the light was that of the grey afternoon. Though everything about it was the same, the old sofa, the table burdened with books, there seemed nothing to connect it with the hectic strangeness of the previous night. The room seemed to sit there with raised eyebrows, innocently saying âYes?â
âMilk?â called out Reg from the kitchen.
âPlease,â replied Dirk. He gave Richard a smile which seemed to him to be half-mad with suppressed excitement.
âOne lump or two?â called Reg again.
âOne, please,â said Dirk, â...and two spoons of sugar if you would.âThere was a suspension of activity in the kitchen. A moment or two passed and Reg stuck his head round the door.
âSvlad Cjelli!â he exclaimed. âGood heavens! Well, that was quick work, young MacDuff, well done. My dear fellow, how very excellent to see you, how good of you to come.â
He wiped his hands on a tea towel he was carrying and hurried over to shake hands.

âMy dear Svlad.â
âDirk, please, if you would,â said Dirk, grasping his hand warmly, âI prefer it. It has more of a sort of Scottish dagger feel to it, I think. Dirk Gently is the name under which I now trade. There are certain events in the past, Iâm afraid, from which I would wish to disassociate myself.â
âAbsolutely, I know how you feel. Most of the fourteenth century, for instance, was pretty grim,â agreed Reg earnestly.
Dirk was about to correct the misapprehension, but thought that it might be somewhat of a long trek and left it.
âSo how have you been, then, my dear Professor?â he said instead, decorously placing his hat and scarf upon the arm of the sofa.
âWell,â said Reg, âitâs been an interesting time recently, or rather, a dull time. But dull for interesting reasons. Now, sit down again, warm yourselves by the fire, and I will get the tea and endeavour to explain.â He bustled out again, humming busily, and left them to settle themselves in front of the fire.
Richard leant over to Dirk. âI had no idea you knew him so well,â he said with a nod in the direction of the kitchen.
âI donât,â said Dirk instantly. âWe met once by chance at some dinner, but there was an immediate sympathy and rapport.â
âSo how come you never met again?â
âHe studiously avoided me, of course. Close rapports with people are dangerous if you have a secret to hide. And as secrets go, I fancy that this is somewhat of a biggie. If there is a bigger secret anywhere in the world I would very much care,â he said quietly, âto know what it is.â
He gave Richard a significant look and held his hands out to the fire. Since Richard had tried before without success to draw him out on exactly what the secret was, he refused to rise to the bait on this occasion, but sat back in his

armchair and looked about him.
âDid I ask you,â said Reg, returning at that moment, âif you wanted any tea?â
âEr, yes,â said Richard, âwe spoke about it at length. I think we agreed in the end that we would, didnât we?â
âGood,â said Reg, vaguely, âby a happy chance there seems to be some ready in the kitchen. Youâll have to forgive me. I have a memory like a... like a... what are those things you drain rice in? What am I talking about?â
With a puzzled look he turned smartly round and disappeared once more into the kitchen.
âVery interesting,â said Dirk quietly, âI wondered if his memory might be poor.â
He stood, suddenly, and prowled around the room. His eyes fell on the abacus which stood on the only clear space on the large mahogany table.
âIs this the table,â he asked Richard in a low voice, âwhere you found the note about the salt cellar?â
âYes,â said Richard, standing, and coming over, âtucked into this book.â He picked up the guide to the Greek islands and flipped through it.
âYes, yes, of course,â said Dirk, impatiently. âWe know about all that. Iâm just interested that this was the table.â He ran his fingers along its edge, curiously.
âIf you think it was some sort of prior collaboration between Reg and the girl,â Richard said, âthen I must say that I donât think it possibly can have been.â
âOf course it wasnât,â said Dirk testily, âI would have thought that was perfectly clear.â

Richard shrugged in an effort not to get angry and put the book back down again.
âWell, itâs an odd coincidence that the book should have been...â
âOdd coincidence!â snorted Dirk. âHa! We shall see how much of a coincidence. We shall see exactly how odd it was. I would like you, Richard, to ask our friend how he performed the trick.â
âI thought you said you knew already.â
âI do,â said Dirk airily. âI would like to hear it confirmed.â
âOh, I see,â said Richard, âyes, thatâs rather easy, isnât it? Get him to explain it, and then say, âYes, thatâs exactly what I thought it was!â Very good, Dirk. Have we come all the way up here in order to have him explain how he did a conjuring trick? I think I must be mad.âDirk bridled at this.
âPlease do as I ask,â he snapped angrily. âYou saw him do the trick, you must ask how he did it. Believe me, there is an astounding secret hidden within it. I know it, but I want you to hear it from him.â
He spun round as Reg re-entered, bearing a tray, which he carried round the sofa and put on to the low coffee table that sat in front of the fire.
âProfessor Chronotis...â said Dirk. âReg,â said Reg, âplease.â
âVery, well,â said Dirk, âReg...â âSieve!â exclaimed Reg.
âWhat?â
âThing you drain rice in. A sieve. I was trying to remember the word, though I forget now the reason why. No matter. Dirk, dear fellow, you look as if you

are about to explode about something. Why donât you sit down and make yourself comfortable?â
âThank you, no, I would rather feel free to pace up and down fretfully if I may. Reg...â
He turned to face him square on, and raised a single finger. âI must tell you,â he said, âthat I know your secret.â
âAh, yes, er -- do you indeed?â mumbled Reg, looking down awkwardly and fiddling with the cups and teapot. âI see.â
The cups rattled violently as he moved them. âYes, I was afraid of that.â
âAnd there are some questions that we would like to ask you. I must tell you that I await the answers with the very greatest apprehension.ââIndeed, indeed,â Reg muttered. âWell, perhaps it is at last time. I hardly know myself what to make of recent events and am... fearful myself. Very well. Ask what you will.â He looked up sharply, his eyes glittering.
Dirk nodded curtly at Richard, turned, and started to pace, glaring at the floor.
âEr,â said Richard, âwell. Iâd be... interested to know how you did the conjuring trick with the salt cellar last night.â
Reg seemed surprised and rather confused by the question. âThe conjuring trick?â he said.
âEr, yes,â said Richard, âthe conjuring trick.â
âOh,â said Reg, taken aback, âwell, the conjuring part of it, Iâm not sure I should -- Magic Circle rules, you know, very strict about revealing these secrets. Very strict. Impressive trick, though, donât you think?â he added slyly.
âWell, yes,â said Richard, âit seemed very natural at the time, but now that I... think about it, I have to admit that it was a bit dumbfounding.â

âAh, well,â said Reg, âitâs skill. you see. Practice. Make it look natural.â
âIt did look very natural,â continued Richard, feeling his way, âI was quite taken in.â
âYou liked it?â
âIt was very impressive.â
Dirk was getting a little impatient. He shot a look to that effect at Richard.
âAnd I can quite see,â said Richard firmly, âwhy itâs impossible for you to tell me. I was just interested, thatâs all. Sorry I asked.â
âWell,â said Reg in a sudden seizure of doubt, âI suppose... well, so long as you absolutely promise not to tell anyone else.â he carried on, âI suppose you can probably work out for yourself that I used two of the salt cellars on the table. No one was going to notice the difference between one and another. The quickness of the hand, you know, deceives the eye, particularly some of the eyes around that table. While I was fiddling with my woolly hat, giving, though I say so myself, a very cunning simulation of clumsiness and muddle, I
simply slipped the salt cellar down my sleeve. You see?â
His earlier agitation had been swept away completely by his pleasure in showing off his craft.
âItâs the oldest trick in the world, in fact,â he continued, âbut nevertheless takes a great deal of skill and deftness. Then a little later, of course, I returned it to the table with the appearance of simply passing it to someone else. Takes years of practice, of course, to make it look natural, but I much prefer it to simply slipping the thing down to the floor. Amateur stuff that. You canât pick it up, and the cleaners never notice it for at least a fortnight. I once had a dead thrush under my seat for a month. No trick involved there, of course. Cat killed it.â
Reg beamed.

Richard felt he had done his bit, but hadnât the faintest idea where it was supposed to have got them. He glanced at Dirk, who gave him no help whatsoever, so he plunged on blindly.
âYes,â he said, âyes, I understand that that can be done by sleight of hand. What I donât understand is how the salt cellar got embedded in the pot.â
Reg looked puzzled once again, as if they were all talking at cross purposes. He looked at Dirk, who stopped pacing and stared at him with bright, expectant eyes.
âWell, thatâs... perfectly straightforward,â said Reg, âdidnât take any conjuring skill at all. I nipped out for my hat, you remember?â
âYes,â said Richard, doubtfully.
âWell,â said Reg, âwhile I was out of the room I went to find the man who made the pot. Took some time, of course. About three weeks of detective
work to track him down and another couple of days to sober him up, and then with a little difficulty I persuaded him to bake the salt cellar into the pot for me. After that I briefly stopped off somewhere to find some, er, powder to disguise the suntan, and of course I had to time the return a little carefully so as to make it all look natural. I bumped into myself in the anteroom, which I always find embarrassing, I never know where to look, but, er... well, there you have it.â
He smiled a rather bleak and nervous smile. Richard tried to nod, but eventually gave up. âWhat on earth are you talking about?â he said. Reg looked at him in surprise.
âI thought you said you knew my secret,â he said.

âI do,â said Dirk, with a beam of triumph. âHe, as yet, does not, though he furnished all the information I needed to discover it. Let me,â he added, âfill in a couple of little blanks. In order to help disguise the fact that you had in fact been away for weeks when as far as anyone sitting at the table was concerned you had only popped out of the door for a couple of seconds, you had to write down for your own reference the last thing you said, in order that you could pick up the thread of conversation again as naturally as possible. An important detail if your memory is not what it once was. Yes?â
âWhat it once was,â said Reg, slowly shaking his white head, âI can hardly remember what it once was. But yes, you are very sharp to pick up such a detail.â
âAnd then there is the little matter,â continued Dirk, âof the questions that George III asked. Asked you.â
This seemed to catch Reg quite by surprise.
âHe asked you,â continued Dirk, consulting a small notebook he had pulled from his pocket, âif there was any particular reason why one thing happened after another and if there was any way of stopping it. Did he not also ask you, and ask you first, if it was possible to move backwards in time, or something of that kind?âReg gave Dirk a long and appraising look.
âI was right about you,â he said, âyou have a very remarkable mind, young man.â He walked slowly over to the window that looked out on to Second Court. He watched the odd figures scuttling through it hugging themselves in the drizzle or pointing at things.
âYes,â said Reg at last in a subdued voice, âthat is precisely what he said.â
âGood,â said Dirk, snapping shut his notebook with a tight little smile which said that he lived for such praise, âthen that explains why the answers were yes, no and maybe -- in that order. Now. Where is it?ââWhere is what?â
âThe time machine.â

âYouâre standing in it.â said Reg.
CHAPTER 26
A party of noisy people spilled into the trainat Bishopâs Stortford. Some were wearing morning suits with carnations looking a little battered by a dayâs festivity. The women of the party were in smart dresses and hats, chattering excitedly about how pretty Julia had looked in all that silk taffeta, how Ralph still looked like a smug oaf even done up in all his finery, and generally giving the whole thing about two weeks.
One of the men stuck his head out of the window and hailed a passing railway employee just to check that this was the right train and was stopping at Cambridge. The porter confirmed that of course it bloody was. The young man said that they didnât all want to find they were going off in the wrong direction, did they, and made a sound a little like that of a fish barking, as if to indicate that this was a pricelessly funny remark, and then pulled his head back in, banging it on the way.
The alcohol content of the atmosphere in the carriage rose sharply.There seemed to be a general feeling in the air that the best way of getting themselves in the right mood for the post-wedding reception party that evening was to make a foray to the bar so that any members of the party who were not already completely drunk could finish the task. Rowdy shouts of
acclamation greeted this notion, the train restarted with a jolt and a lot of those still standing fell over.
Three young men dropped into the three empty seats round one table, of which the fourth was already taken by a sleekly overweight man in an old-fashioned suit. He had a lugubrious face and his large, wet, cowlike eyes gazed into some unknown distance.
Very slowly his eyes began to refocus all the way from infinity and gradually to home in on his more immediate surroundings, his new and intrusive

companions. There was a need he felt, as he had felt before.The three men were discussing loudly whether they would all go to the bar, whether some of them would go to the bar and bring back drinks for the others, whether the ones who went to the bar would get so excited by all the drinks there that they would stay put and forget to bring any back for the others who would be sitting here anxiously awaiting their return, and whether even if they did remember to come back immediately with the drinks they would actually be capable of carrying them and wouldnât simply throw them all over the carriage on the way back, incommoding other passengers.
Some sort of consensus seemed to be reached, but almost immediately none of them could remember what it was. Two of them got up, then sat down again as the third one got up. Then he sat down. The two other ones stood up again, expressing the idea that it might be simpler if they just bought the entire bar.
The third was about to get up again and follow them, when slowly, but with unstoppable purpose, the cow-eyed man sitting opposite him leant across, and gripped him firmly by the forearm.
The young man in his morning suit looked up as sharply as his somewhat bubbly brain would allow and, startled, said, âWhat do you want?â
Michael Wenton-Weakes gazed into his eyes with terrible intensity, and said, in a low voice, âI was on a ship...â
âWhat?â
âA ship...â said Michael.
âWhat ship, what are you talking about? Get off me. Let go!â
âWe came,â continued Michael, in a quiet, almost inaudible, but compelling voice, âa monstrous distance. We came to build a paradise. A paradise. Here.â
His eyes swam briefly round the carriage, and then gazed briefly out through the spattered windows at the gathering gloom of a drizzly East Anglian evening. He gazed with evident loathing. His grip on the otherâs forearm

tightened.
âLook, Iâm going for a drink,â said the wedding guest, though feebly, because he clearly wasnât.
âWe left behind those who would destroy themselves with war,â murmured Michael. âOurs was to be a world of peace, of music, of art, of enlightenment. All that was petty, all that was mundane, all that was contemptible would have no place in our world...â
The stilled reveller looked at Michael wonderingly. He didnât look like an old hippy. Of course, you never could tell. His own elder brother had once spent a couple of years living in a Druidic commune, eating LSD doughnuts
and thinking he was a tree, since when he had gone on to become a director of a merchant bank. The difference, of course, was that he hardly ever still
thought he was a tree, except just occasionally, and he had long ago learnt to avoid the particular claret which sometimes triggered off that flashback.
âThere were those who said we would fail,â continued Michael in his low tone that carried clearly under the boisterous noise that filled the carriage, âwho prophesied that we too carried in us the seed of war, but it was our high resolve and purpose that only art and beauty should flourish, the highest art, the highest beauty -- music. We took with us only those who believed, who wished it to be true.â
âBut what are you talking about?â asked the wedding guest though not challengingly, for he had fallen under Michaelâs mesmeric spell. âWhen was this? Where was this?â
Michael breathed hard. âBefore you were born --âhe said at last, âbe still, and I will tell you.â
CHAPTER 27

There was a long startled silence during which the evening gloom outside seemed to darken appreciably and gather the room into its grip. A trick of the light wreathed Reg in shadows.
Dirk was, for one of the few times in a life of exuberantly prolific loquacity, wordless. His eyes shone with a childâs wonder as they passed anew over the dull and shabby furniture of the room, the panelled walls, the threadbare carpets. His hands were trembling.
Richard frowned faintly to himself for a moment as if he was trying to work out the square root of something in his head, and then looked back directly at Reg.
âWho are you?â he asked.
âI have absolutely no idea,â said Reg brightly, âmuch of my memoryâs gone completely. I am very old, you see. Startlingly old. Yes, I think if I were to tell you how old I was it would be fair to say that you would be startled. Odds are that so would I, because I canât remember. Iâve seen an awful lot, you know. Forgotten most of it, thank God. Trouble is, when you start getting to my age, which, as I think I mentioned earlier, is a somewhat startling one -- did I say that?â
âYes, you did mention it.â
âGood. Iâd forgotten whether I had or not. The thing is that your memory doesnât actually get any bigger, and a lot of stuff just falls out. So you see, the major difference between someone of my age and someone of yours is not how much I know, but how much Iâve forgotten. And after a while you even forget what it is youâve forgotten, and after that you even forget that there was something to remember. Then you tend to forget, er, what it was you were talking about.â
He stared helplessly at the teapot.
âThings you remember...â prompted Richard gently. âSmells and earrings.â

âI beg your pardon?â
âThose are things that linger for some reason,â said Reg, shaking his head in a puzzled way. He sat down suddenly. âThe earrings that Queen Victoria wore on her Silver Jubilee. Quite startling objects. Toned down in the pictures of the period, of course. The smell of the streets before there were cars in them. Hard to say which was worse. Thatâs why Cleopatra remains so vividly in
the memory, of course. A quite devastating combination of earrings and smell. I think that will probably be the last thing that remains when all else has finally fled. I shall sit alone in a darkened room, sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything but a little grey old head, and in that little grey old head a peculiar vision of hideous blue and gold dangling things flashing in the light, and the smell of sweat, catfood and death. I wonder what I shall make of it...â
Dirk was scarcely breathing as he began to move slowly round the room, gently brushing his fingertips over the walls, the sofa, the table.
âHow long,â he said, âhas this been --ââHere?â said Reg. âJust about two hundred years. Ever since I retired.â
âRetired from what?â
âSearch me. Must have been something pretty good, though, what do you think?â
âYou mean youâve been in this same set of rooms here for... two hundred years?â murmured Richard. âYouâd think someone would notice, or think it was odd.â
âOh, thatâs one of the delights of the older Cambridge colleges,â said Reg, âeveryone is so discreet. If we all went around mentioning what was odd about each other weâd be here till Christmas. Svlad, er -- Dirk, my dear fellow, please donât touch that just at the moment.â
Dirkâs hand was reaching out to touch the abacus standing on its own on the only clear spot on the big table.

âWhat is it?â said Dirk sharply.
âItâs just what it looks like, an old wooden abacus,â said Reg. âIâll show you in a moment, but first I must congratulate you on your powers of perception. May I ask how you arrived at the solution?ââI have to admit,â said Dirk with rare humility, âthat I did not. In the end I asked a child. I told him the story of the trick and asked him how he thought it had been done, and he said and I quote, âItâs bleedinâ obvious, innit, he mustâve âad a bleedinâ time machine.â I thanked the little fellow and gave him a shilling for his trouble. He kicked me rather sharply on the shin and went about his business. But he was the one who solved it. My only contribution to the matter was to see that he must be right. He had even saved me the bother of kicking myself.â
âBut you had the perception to think of asking a child,â said Reg. âWell then, I congratulate you on that instead.â
Dirk was still eyeing the abacus suspiciously.
âHow... does it work?â he said, trying to make it sound like a casual enquiry.
âWell, itâs really terribly simple,â said Reg, âit works any way you want it to. You see, the computer that runs it is a rather advanced one. In fact it is more powerful than the sum total of all the computers on this planet including -- and this is the tricky part -- including itself. Never really understood that bit myself, to be honest with you. But over ninety-five per cent of that power is used in simply understanding what it is you want it to do. I simply plonk my abacus down there and it understands the way I use it. I think I must have been brought up to use an abacus when I was a... well, a child, I suppose.
âRichard, for instance, would probably want to use his own personal computer. If you put it down there, where the abacus is the machineâs computer would simple take charge of it and offer you lots of nice user-friendly time-travel applications complete with pull-down menus and desk accessories if you like. Except that you point to 1066 on the screen and youâve got the Battle of Hastings going on outside your door, er, if thatâs the sort of thing youâre

interested in.â
Regâs tone of voice suggested that his own interests lay in other areas.
âItâs, er, really quite fun in its way,â he concluded. âCertainly better than television and a great deal easier to use than a video recorder. If I miss a programme I just pop back in time and watch it. Iâm hopeless fiddling with all those buttons.â
Dirk reacted to this revelation with horror.
âYou have a time machine and you use it for... watching television?ââWell, I wouldnât use it at all if I could get the hang of the video recorder. Itâs a very delicate business, time travel, you know. Full of appalling traps and dangers, if you should change the wrong thing in the past, you could entirely disrupt the course of history.
âPlus, of course, it mucks up the telephone. Iâm sorry,â he said to Richard a little sheepishly, âthat you were unable to phone your young lady last night. There seems to be something fundamentally inexplicable about the British telephone system, and my time machine doesnât like it. Thereâs never any problem with the plumbing, the electricity, or even the gas. The connection interfaces are taken care of at some quantum level I donât entirely understand, and itâs never been a problem.
âThe phone on the other hand is definitely a problem. Every time I use the time machine, which is, of course, hardly at all, partly because of this very problem with the phone, the phone goes haywire and I have to get some lout from the phone company to come and fix it, and he starts asking stupid questions the answers to which he has no hope of understanding.
âAnyway, the point is that I have a very strict rule that I must not change anything in the past at all --â Reg sighed -- âwhatever the temptation.â
âWhat temptation?â said Dirk, sharply.
âOh, itâs just a little, er, thing Iâm interested in,â said Reg, vaguely, âit is

perfectly harmless because I stick very strictly to the rule. It makes me sad, though.â
âBut you broke your own rule!â insisted Dirk. âLast night! You changed something in the past --â
âWell, yes,â said Reg, a little uncomfortably, âbut that was different. Very different. If you had seen the look on the poor childâs face. So miserable. She thought the world should be a marvellous place, and all those appalling old dons were pouring their withering scorn on her just because it wasnât marvellous for them anymore.
âI mean,â he added, appealing to Richard, âremember Cawley. What a bloodless old goat. Someone should get some humanity into him even if they have to knock it in with a brick. No, that was perfectly justifiable. Otherwise, I make it a very strict rule --â
Richard looked at him with dawning recognition of something.
âReg,â he said politely, âmay I give you a little advice?â
âOf course you may, my dear fellow, I should adore you to,â said Reg.
âIf our mutual friend here offers to take you for a stroll along the banks of the River Cam, donât go.â
âWhat on earth do you mean?â
âHe means,â said Dirk earnestly, âthat he thinks there may be something a little disproportionate between what you actually did, and your stated reasons for doing it.â
âOh. Well, odd way of saying it --â
âWell, heâs a very odd fellow. But you see, there sometimes may be other reasons for things you do which you are not necessarily aware of. As in the case of post-hypnotic suggestion -- or possession.â

Reg turned very pale. âPossession --â he said.
âProfessor -- Reg -- I believe there was some reason you wanted to see me. What exactly was it?â
âCambridge! this is... Cambridge!â came the lilting squawk of the station public address system.
Crowds of noisy revellers spewed out on to the platform barking and honking at each other.
âWhereâs Rodney?â said one, who had clambered with difficulty from the carriage in which the bar was situated. He and his companion looked up and down the platform, totteringly. The large figure of Michael Wenton-Weakes loomed silently past them and out to the exit.
They jostled their way down the side of the train, looking in through the dirty carriage windows. They suddenly saw their missing companion still sitting, trance-like, in his seat in the now almost empty compartment. They banged on the window and hooted at him. For a moment or two he didnât react, and when he did he woke suddenly in a puzzled way as if seeming not to know where he was.
âHeâs pie-eyed!â his companions bawled happily, bundling themselves on to the train again and bundling Rodney back off.
He stood woozily on the platform and shook his head. Then glancing up he saw through the railings the large bulk of Michael Wenton-Weakes heaving himself and a large heavy bag into a taxi-cab, and he stood for a moment transfixed.
ââStraordinary thing,â he said, âthat man. Telling me a long story about some kind of shipwreck.â

âHar har,â gurgled one of his two companions, âget any money off you?â
âWhat?â said Rodney, puzzled. âNo. No, I donât think so. Except it wasnât a shipwreck, more an accident, an explosion -- ? He seems to think he caused it in some way. Or rather there was an accident, and he caused an explosion trying to put it right and killed everybody. Then he said there was an awful lot of rotting mud for years and years, and then slimy things with legs. It was all a bit peculiar.â
âTrust Rodney! Trust Rodney to pick a madman!â
âI think he must have been mad. He suddenly went off on a tangent about some bird. He said the bit about the bird was all nonsense. He wished he could get rid of the bit about the bird. But then he said it would be put right. It would all be put right. For some reason I didnât like it when he said that.â
âShould have come along to the bar with us. Terribly funny, we --â âI also didnât like the way he said goodbye. I didnât like that at all.â
CHAPTER 28
âYou remember,â said Reg, âwhen you arrived this afternoon I said that times recently had been dull, but for... interesting reasons?â
âI remember it vividly,â said Dirk, âit happened a mere ten minutes ago. You were standing exactly there as I recall. Indeed you were wearing the very clothes with which you are currently apparelled, and - -â
âShut up, Dirk,â said Richard, âlet the poor man talk, will you?â
Dirk made a slight, apologetic bow.
âQuite so,â said Reg. âWell, the truth is that for many weeks, months even, I

have not used the time machine at all, because I had the oddest feeling that someone or something was trying to make me do it. It started as the very faintest urge, and then it seemed to come at me in stronger and stronger waves. It was extremely disturbing. I had to fight it very hard indeed because it was trying to make me do something I actually wanted to do. I donât think I would have realised that it was something outside of me creating this pressure and not just my own wishes asserting themselves if it wasnât for the fact that I was so wary of allowing myself to do any such thing. As soon as I began to realise that it was something else trying to invade me things got really bad and
the furniture began to fly about. Quite damaged my little Georgian writing desk. Look at the marks on the --â
âIs that what you were afraid of last night, upstairs?â asked Richard.
âOh yes,â said Reg in a hushed voice, âmost terribly afraid. But it was only that rather nice horse, so that was all right. I expect it just wandered in when I was out getting some powder to cover up my suntan.â
âOh?â said Dirk, âAnd where did you go for that?â he asked. âI canât think of many chemists that a horse would be likely to visit.â
âOh, thereâs a planet off in whatâs known here as the Pleiades where the dust is exactly the right --â
âYou went,â said Dirk in a whisper, âto another planet? To get face powder?â
âOh, itâs no distance,â said Reg cheerfully. âYou see, the actual distance between two points in the whole of the space\time continuum is almost infinitely smaller than the apparent distance between adjacent orbits of an electron. Really, itâs a lot less far than the chemist, and thereâs no waiting about at the till. I never have the right change, do you? Go for the quantum jump is always my preference. Except of course that you then get all the trouble with the telephone. Nothingâs ever that easy, is it?â
He looked bothered for a moment.
âI think you may be right in what I think youâre thinking, though,â he added

quietly. âWhich is?â
âThat I went through a rather elaborate bit of business to achieve a very small result. Cheering up a little girl, charming, delightful and sad though she was, doesnât seem to be enough explanation for -- well, it was a fairly major operation in time-engineering, now that I come to face up to it. Thereâs no doubt that it would have been simpler to compliment her on her dress. Maybe the... ghost -- we are talking of a ghost here, arenât we?â
âI think we are, yes,â said Dirk slowly.
âA ghost?â said Richard, âNow come on --â
âWait!â said Dirk, abruptly. âPlease continue,â he said to Reg.
âItâs possible that the... ghost caught me off my guard. I was fighting so strenuously against doing one thing that it easily tripped me into another --â
âAnd now?â
âOh, itâs gone completely. The ghost left me last night.â
âAnd where, we wonder,â said Dirk, turning his gaze on Richard, âdid it go?â
âNo, please,â said Richard, ânot this. Iâm not even sure Iâve agreed weâre talking about time machines yet, and now suddenly itâs ghosts?â
âSo what was it,â hissed Dirk, âthat got into you to make you climb the wall?â
âWell, you suggested that I was under post-hypnotic suggestion from someone - -â
âI did not! I demonstrated the power of post-hypnotic suggestion to you. But I believe that hypnosis and possession work in very, very similar ways. You can be made to do all kinds of absurd things, and will then cheerfully invent

the most transparent rationalisations to explain them to yourself. But -- you cannot be made to do something that runs against the fundamental grain of your character. You will fight. You will resist!â
Richard remembered then the sense of relief with which he had impulsively replaced the tape in Susanâs machine last night. It had been the end of a struggle which he had suddenly won. With the sense of another struggle that he was now losing he sighed and related this to the others.
âExactly!â exclaimed Dirk. âYou wouldnât do it! Now weâre getting somewhere! You see, hypnosis works best when the subject has some fundamental sympathy with what he or she is being asked to do. Find the right subject for your task and the hypnosis can take a very, very deep hold indeed. And I believe the same to be true of possession. So. What do we have?
âWe have a ghost that wants something done and is looking for the right person to take possession of to do that for him. Professor --â
âReg --â said Reg.
âReg -- may I ask you something that may be terribly personal? I will understand perfectly if you donât want to answer, but I will just keep pestering you until you do. Just my methods, you see. You said there was something that you found to be a terrible temptation to you. That you wanted to do but would not allow yourself, and that the ghost was trying to make you do? Please. This may be difficult for you, but I think it would be very helpful if you would tell us what it is.â
âI will not tell you.â
âYou must understand how important --â âIâll show you instead,â said Reg.
Silhouetted in the gates of St Ceddâs stood a large figure carrying a large heavy black nylon bag. The figure was that of Michael Wenton-Weakes, the voice that asked the porter if Professor Chronotis was currently in his room was

that of Michael Wenton-Weakes, the ears that heard the porter say he was buggered if he knew because the phone seemed to be on the blink again was that of Michael Wenton-Weakes, but the spirit that gazed out of his eyes was his no longer.
He had surrendered himself completely. All doubt, disparity and confusion had ceased.
A new mind had him in full possession.
The spirit that was not Michael Wenton-Weakes surveyed the college which lay before it, to which it had grown accustomed in the last few frustrating, infuriating weeks.
Weeks! Mere microsecond blinks.
Although the spirit -- the ghost -- that now inhabited Michael Wenton- Weakesâ body had known long periods of near oblivion, sometimes even for centuries at a stretch, the time for which it had wandered the earth was such that it seemed only minutes ago that the creatures which had erected these walls had arrived. Most of his personal eternity -- not really eternity, but a few billion years could easily seem like it -- had been spent wandering across interminable mud, wading through ceaseless seas, watching with stunned horror when the slimy things with legs suddenly had begun to crawl from those rotting seas -- and here they were, suddenly walking around as if they
owned the place and complaining about the phones.
Deep in a dark and silent part of himself he knew that he was now mad, had been driven mad almost immediately after the accident by the knowledge of what he had done and of the existence he faced, by the memories of his fellows who had died and who for a while had haunted him even as he had haunted the Earth.
He knew that what he now had been driven to would have revolted the self he only infinitesimally remembered, but that it was the only way for him to end the ceaseless nightmare in which each second of billions of years had been worse than the previous one.

He hefted the bag and started to walk.
CHAPTER 29
Deep in the rain forest it was doing what it usually does in rain forests, which was raining: hence the name.
It was a gentle, persistent rain, not the heavy slashing which would come later in the year, in the hot season. It formed a fine dripping mist through which the occasional shaft of sunlight would break, be softened and pass through on its way towards the wet bark of a calvaria tree on which it would settle and glisten. Sometimes it would do this next to a butterfly or a tiny motionless sparkling lizard, and then the effect would be almost unbearable.
Away up in the high canopy of the trees an utterly extraordinary thought would suddenly strike a bird, and it would go flapping wildly through the branches and settle at last in a different and altogether better tree where it would sit and consider things again more calmly until the same thought came along and struck it again, or it was time to eat.
The air was full of scents -- the light fragrance of flowers, and the heavy odour of the sodden mulch with which the floor of the forest was carpeted.
Confusions of roots tangled through the mulch, moss grew on them, insects crawled.
In a space in the forest, on an empty patch of wet ground between a circle of craning trees, appeared quietly and without fuss a plain white door. After a few seconds it opened a little way with a slight squeak. A tall thin man looked out, looked around, blinked in surprise, and quietly pulled the door closed again.
A few seconds later the door opened again and Reg looked out.

âItâs real,â he said, âI promise you. Come out and see for yourself.â Walking out into the forest, he turned and beckoned the other two to follow him.
Dirk stepped boldly through, seemed disconcerted for about the length of time it takes to blink twice, and then announced that he saw exactly how it worked, that it was obviously to do with the unreal numbers that lay between minimum quantum distances and defined the fractal contours of the enfolded Universe and he was only astonished at himself for not having thought of it himself.
âLike the catflap,â said Richard from the doorway behind him.
âEr, yes, quite so,â said Dirk, taking off his spectacles and leaning against a tree wiping them, âyou spotted of course that I was lying. A perfectly natural reflex in the circumstances as I think youâll agree. Perfectly natural.â He squinted slightly and put his spectacles back on. They began to mist up again almost immediately.
âAstounding,â he admitted.
Richard stepped through more hesitantly and stood rocking for a moment with one foot still on the floor in Regâs room and the other on the wet earth of the forest. Then he stepped forward and committed himself fully.
His lungs instantly filled with the heady vapours and his mind with the wonder of the place. He turned and looked at the doorway through which he had walked. It was still a perfectly ordinary door frame with a perfectly ordinary little white door swinging open in it, but it was standing free in the open forest, and through it could clearly he seen the room he had just stepped out of.
He walked wonderingly round the back of the door, testing each foot on the muddy ground, not so much for fear of slipping as for fear that it might simply not be there. From behind it was just a perfectly ordinary open door frame, such as you might fail to find in any perfectly ordinary rain forest. He walked through the door from behind, and looking back again could once more see, as if he had just stepped out of them again, the college rooms of Professor Urban

Chronotis of St Ceddâs College, Cambridge, which must be thousands of miles away. Thousands? Where were they?
He peered off through the trees and thought he caught a slight shimmer in the distance, between the trees.
âIs that the sea?â he asked.
âYou can see it a little more clearly from up here,â called Reg, who had walked on a little way up a slippery incline and was now leaning, puffing, against a tree. He pointed.
The other two followed him up, pulling themselves noisily through the branches and causing a lot of cawing and complaining from unseen birds high above.
âThe Pacific?â asked Dirk.
âThe Indian Ocean,â said Reg.
Dirk wiped his glasses again and had another look. âAh, yes, of course,â he said.
âNot Madagascar?â said Richard. âIâve been there --â
âHave you?â said Reg. âOne of the most beautiful and astonishing places on Earth, and one that is also full of the most appalling... temptations for me. No.â
His voice trembled slightly, and he cleared his throat.
âNo,â he continued, âMadagascar is -- let me see, which direction are we -- whereâs the sun? Yes. That way. Westish. Madagascar is about five hundred miles roughly west of here. The island of RÃ©union lies roughly in-between.â
âEr, whatâs the place called?â said Dirk suddenly, rapping his knuckles on

the tree and frightening a lizard. âPlace where that stamp comes from, er -- Mauritius.â
âStamp?â said Reg.
âYes, you must know,â said Dirk, âvery famous stamp. Canât remember anything about it, but it comes from here. Mauritius. Famous for its very remarkable stamp, all brown and smudged and you could buy Blenheim Palace with it. Or am I thinking of British Guiana?â
âOnly you,â said Richard, âknow what you are thinking of.â âIs it Mauritius?â
âIt is,â said Reg, âit is Mauritius.â
âBut you donât collect stamps?â
âNo.â
âWhat on earthâs that?â said Richard suddenly, but Dirk carried on with his thought to Reg, âPity, you could get some nice first-day covers, couldnât you?â
Reg shrugged. âNot really interested,â he said. Richard slithered back down the slope behind them.
âSo whatâs the great attraction here?â said Dirk. âItâs not, I have to confess, what I was expecting. Very nice in its way, of course, all this nature, but Iâm a city boy myself, Iâm afraid.â He cleaned his glasses once again and pushed them back up his nose.
He started backwards at what he saw, and heard a strange little chuckle from Reg. Just in front of the door back into Regâs room, the most extraordinary confrontation was taking place.

A large cross bird was looking at Richard and Richard was looking at a large cross bird. Richard was looking at the bird as if it was the most extraordinary thing he had ever seen in his life, and the bird was looking at Richard as if defying him to find its beak even remotely funny.
Once it had satisfied itself that Richard did not intend to laugh, the bird regarded him instead with a sort of grim irritable tolerance and wondered if
he was just going to stand there or actually do something useful and feed it. It padded a couple of steps back and a couple of steps to the side and then just a single step forward again, ongreat waddlingyellow feet. It then looked athim again, impatiently, and squarked an impatient squark.
The bird then bent forward and scraped its great absurd red beak across the ground as if to give Richard the idea that this might be a good area to look for things to give it to eat.
âIt eats the nuts of the calvaria tree,â called out Reg to Richard.The big bird looked sharply up at Reg in annoyance, as if to say that it was perfectly clear to any idiot what it ate. It then looked back at Richard once more and stuck its head on one side as if it had suddenly been struck by the thought that perhaps it was an idiot it had to deal with, and that it might need to reconsider its strategy accordingly.
âThere are one or two on the ground behind you,â called Reg softly.In a trance of astonishment Richard turned awkwardly and saw one or two large nuts lying on the ground. He bent and picked one up, glancing up at Reg, who gave him a reassuring nod.
Tentatively Richard held the thing out to the bird, which leant forward and pecked it sharply from between his fingers. Then, because Richardâs hand was still stretched out, the bird knocked it irritably aside with its beak.
Once Richard had withdrawn to a respectful distance, it stretched its neck up, closed its large yellow eyes and seemed to gargle gracelessly as it shook the nut down its neck into its maw.
It appeared then to be at least partially satisfied. Whereas before it had been a

cross dodo, it was at least now a cross, fed dodo, which was probably about as much as it could hope for in this life.
It made a slow, waddling, on-the-spot turn and padded back into the forest whence it had come, as if defying Richard to find the little tuft of curly feathers stuck up on top of its backside even remotely funny.
âI only come to look,â said Reg in a small voice, and glancing at him Dirk was discomfited to see that the old manâs eyes were brimming with tears which he quickly brushed away. âReally, it is not for me to interfere --â
Richard came scurrying breathlessly up to them. âWas that a dodo?â he exclaimed.
âYes,â said Reg, âone of only three left at this time. The year is 1676. They will all be dead within four years, and after that no one will ever see them again. Come,â he said, âlet us go.â
Behind the stoutly locked outer door in the corner staircase in the Second Court of St Ceddâs College, where only a millisecond earlier there had been a slight flicker as the inner door departed, there was another slight flicker as the inner door now returned.
Walking through the dark evening towards it the large figure of Michael Wenton-Weakes looked up at the corner windows. If any slight flicker had been visible, it would have gone unnoticed in the dim dancing firelight that spilled from the window.
The figure then looked up into the darkness of the sky, looking for what it knew to be there though there was not the slightest chance of seeing it, even on a clear night which this was not. The orbits of Earth were now so cluttered with pieces of junk and debris that one more item among them -- even such a large one as this was -- would pass perpetually unnoticed. Indeed, it had done
so, though its influence had from time to time exerted itself. From time to time. When the waves had been strong. Not for nearly two hundred years had they been so strong as now they were again.

And all at last was now in place. The perfect carrier had been found. The perfect carrier moved his footsteps onwards through the court.
The Professor himself had seemed the perfect choice at first, but that attempt had ended in frustration, fury, and then -- inspiration! Bring a Monk to Earth! They were designed to believe anything, to be completely malleable. It could be suborned to undertake the task with the greatest of ease.
Unfortunately, however, this onehad proved to be completely hopeless. Getting it to believe something was very easy. Getting it to continue to believe the same thing for more than five minutes at a time had proved to be an even more impossible task than that of getting the Professor to do what he fundamentally wanted to do but wouldnât allow himself.
Then another failure and then, miraculously, the perfect carrier had come at last.
The perfect carrier had already proved that it would have no compunction in doing what would have to be done.
Damply, clogged in mist, the moon struggled in a corner of the sky to rise. At the window, a shadow moved.
CHAPTER 30
From the window overlooking Second Court Dirk watched the moon. âWe shall not,â he said, âhave long to wait.â
âTo wait for what?â said Richard. Dirk turned.

âFor the ghost,â he said, âto return to us. Professor --â he added to Reg, who was sitting anxiously by the fire, âdo you have any brandy, French cigarettes or worry beads in your rooms?â
âNo,â said Reg.
âThen I shall have to fret unaided,â said Dirk and returned to staring out of the window.
âI have yet to be convinced,â said Richard, âthat there is not some other explanation than that of... ghosts to --â
âJust as you required actually to see a time machine in operation before you could accept it,â returned Dirk. âRichard, I commend you on your scepticism, but even the sceptical mind must be prepared to accept the unacceptable when there is no alternative. If it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, we have at least to consider the possibility that we have a small aquatic bird of the family Anatidae on our hands.ââThen what is a ghost?â
âI think that a ghost...â said Dirk, âis someone who died either violently or unexpectedly with unfinished business on his, her -- or its -- hands. Who cannot rest until it has been finished, or put right.â
He turned to face them again.
âWhich is why,â he said, âa time machine would have such a fascination for a ghost once it knew of its existence. A time machine provides the means to put right what, in the ghostâs opinion, went wrong in the past. To free it.
âWhich is why it will be back. It tried first to take possession of Reg himself, but he resisted. Then came the incident with the conjuring trick, the face powder and the horse in the bathroom which I --â he paused -- âwhich even I do not understand, though I intend to if it kills me. And then you, Richard, appear on the scene. The ghost deserts Reg and concentrates instead on you. Almost immediately there occurs an odd but significant incident. You do something that you then wish you hadnât done.

âI refer, of course, to the phone call you made to Susan and left on her answering machine.
âThe ghost seizes its chance and tries to induce you to undo it. To, as it were, go back into the past and erase that message -- to change the mistake you had made. Just to see if you would do it. Just to see if it was in your character.
âIf it had been, you would now be totally under its control. But at the very last second your nature rebelled and you would not do it. And so the ghost gives you up as a bad job and deserts you in turn. It must find someone else.
âHow long has it been doing this? I do not know. Does this now make sense to you? Do you recognise the truth of what I am saying?â
Richard turned cold.
âYes,â he said, âI think you must be absolutely right.â
âAnd at what moment, then,â said Dirk, âdid the ghost leave you?â Richard swallowed.
âWhen Michael Wenton-Weakes walked out of the room,â he said.
âSo I wonder,â said Dirk quietly, âwhat possibilities the ghost saw in him. I wonder whether this time it found what it wanted. I believe we shall not have long to wait.â
There was a knock on the door.
When it opened, there stood Michael Wenton-Weakes.
He said simply, âPlease, I need your help.â
Reg and Richard stared at Dirk, and then at Michael.
âDo you mind if I put this down somewhere?â said Michael. âItâs rather

heavy. Full of scuba-diving equipment.â
âOh, I see,â said Susan, âoh well, thanks, Nicola, Iâll try that fingering. Iâm sure he only put the E flat in there just to annoy people. Yes, Iâve been at
it solidly all afternoon. Some of those semiquaver runs in the second movement are absolute bastards. Well, yes, it helped take my mind off it all. No, no news. Itâs all just mystifying and absolutely horrible. I donât want even to -- look, maybe Iâll give you a call again later and see how youâre feeling. I know, yes, you never know whichis worse, do you, the illness, the antibiotics, or the doctorâs bedside manner. Look after yourself, or at least, make sure Simon does. Tell him to bring you gallons of hot lemon. OK. Well, Iâll talk to you later. Keep warm. Bye now.â
She put the phone down and returned to her cello. She had hardly started to reconsider the problem of the irritating E flat when the phone went again. She had simply left it off the hook for the afternoon, but had forgotten to do so again after making her own call.With a sigh she propped up the cello, put down the bow, and went to the phone again.
âHello?â she demanded.
Again, there was nothing, just a distant cry of wind. Irritably, she slammed the receiver back down once more.
She waited a few seconds for the line to clear, and then was about to take the phone off the hook once more when she realised that perhaps Richard might need her.
She hesitated.
She admitted to herself that she hadnât been using the answering machine, because she usually just put it on for Gordonâs convenience, and that was something of which she did not currently wish to be reminded.
Still, she put the answering machine on, turned the volume right down, and returned again to the E flat that Mozart had put in only to annoy cellists.

In the darkness of the offices of Dirk Gentlyâs Holistic Detective Agency, Gordon Way clumsily fumbled the telephone receiver back on to its rest and sat slumped in the deepest dejection. He didnât even stop himself slumping all the way through the seat until he rested lightly on the floor.
Miss Pearce had fled the office the first time the telephone had started actually using itself, her patience with all this sort of thing finally exhausted again, since which time Gordon had had the office to himself.However, hisattempts to contactanybody hadfailed completely.
Or rather, his attempts to contact Susan, which was all he cared about. It was Susan he had been speaking to when he died and he knew he had somehow to speak to her again. But she had left her phone off the hook most of the afternoon and even when she had answered she could not hear him.
He gave up. He roused himself from the floor, stood up, and slipped out and down into the darkening streets. He drifted aimlessly for a while, went for a walk on the canal, which was a trick that palled very quickly, and then wandered back up to the street again.
The houses with light and life streaming from them upset him most particularly since the welcome they seemed to extend would not be extended to him. He wondered if anyone would mind if he simply slipped into their house and watched television for the evening. He wouldnât be any trouble.
Or a cinema.
That would be better, he could go to the cinema.
He turned with more positive, if still insubstantial, footsteps into Noel Road and started to walk up it.
Noel Road, he thought. It rang a vague bell. He had a feeling that he had recently had some dealings with someone in Noel Road. Who was it?
His thoughts were interrupted by a terrible scream of horror that rang through the street. He stood stock still. A few seconds later a door flew open a few

yards from him and a woman ran out of it, wild-eyed and howling.
CHAPTER 31
Richard had never liked Michael Wenton-Weakes and he liked him even less with a ghost in him. He couldnât say why, he had nothing against ghosts personally, didnât think a person should be judged adversely simply for being dead, but -- he didnât like it.
Nevertheless, it was hard not to feel a little sorry for him.
Michael sat forlornly on a stool with his elbow resting on the large table and his head resting on his fingers. He looked ill and haggard. He looked deeply
tired. He looked pathetic. His story had been a harrowing one, and concluded with his attempts to possess first Reg and then Richard.
âYou were,â he concluded, âright. Entirely.â
He said this last to Dirk, and Dirk grimaced as if trying not to beam with triumph too many times in a day.
The voice was Michaelâs and yet it was not Michaelâs. Whatever timbre a voice acquires through a billion or so years of dread and isolation, this voice had acquired it, and it filled those who heard it with a dizzying chill akin to that which clutches the mind and stomach when standing on a cliff at night.
He turned his eyes on Reg and on Richard, and the effect of the eyes, too, was one that provoked pity and terror. Richard had to look away.
âI owe you both an apology,â said the ghost within Michael âwhich I offer you from the depths of my heart, and only hope that as you come to understand the desperation of my predicament, and the hope which this machine offers me, you will understand why I have acted as I have, and that you will find it within yourselves to forgive me. And to help me. I beg you.â

âGive the man a whisky,â said Dirk gruffly.
âHavenât got any whisky,â said Reg. âEr, port? Thereâs a bottle or so of Margaux I could open. Very fine one. Should be chambrÃ©d for an hour, but I can do that of course, itâs very easy, I --â
âWill you help me?â interrupted the ghost.
Reg bustled to fetch some port and some glasses.
âWhy have you taken over the body of this man?â said Dirk.
âI need to have a voice with which to speak and a body with which to act. No harm will come to him, no harm --â
âLet me ask the question again. Why have you taken over the body of this man?â insisted Dirk.
The ghost made Michaelâs body shrug.
âHe was willing. Both of these two gentlemen quite understandably resisted being... well, hypnotised -- your analogy is fair. This one? Well, I think his sense of self is at a low ebb, and he has acquiesced. I am very grateful to him and will not do him any harm.â
âHis sense of self,â repeated Dirk thoughtfully, âis at a low ebb.ââI suppose that is probably true,â said Richard quietly to Dirk. âHe seemed very depressed last night. The one thing that was important to him had been taken away because he, well, he wasnât really very good at it. Although heâs proud I expect he was probably quite receptive to the idea of actually being wanted for something.â
âHmmm,â said Dirk, and said it again. He said it a third time with feeling. Then he whirled round and barked at the figure on the stool.
âMichael Wenton-Weakes!â

Michaelâs head jolted back and he blinked.
âYes?â he said, in his normal lugubrious voice. His eyes followed Dirk as he moved.
âYou can hear me,â said Dirk, âand you can answer for yourself?â âOh, yes,â said Michael, âmost certainly I can.â
âThis... being, this spirit. You know he is in you? You accept his presence? You are a willing party to what he wishes to do?â
âThat is correct. I was much moved by his account of himself, and am very willing to help him. In fact I think it is right for me to do so.ââAll right,â said Dirk with a snap of his fingers, âyou can go.â
Michaelâs head slumped forward suddenly, and then after a second or so it slowly rose again, as if being pumped up from inside like a tyre.The ghost was back in possession.
Dirk took hold of a chair, spun it round and sat astride it facing the ghost in Michael, peering intently into its eyes.
âAgain,â he said, âtell me again. A quick snap account.â
Michaelâs body tensed slightly. It reached out to Dirkâs arm.
âDonât -- touch me!â snapped Dirk. âJust tell me the facts. The first time you try and make me feel sorry for you Iâll poke you in the eye. Or at least, the one youâve borrowed. So leave out all the stuff that sounded like... er --â
âColeridge,â saidRichard suddenly, âitsounded exactly like Coleridge. It was like âThe Rime of the Ancient Marinerâ. Well bits of it were.â
Dirk frowned. âColeridge?â he said.
âI tried to tell him my story,â admitted the ghost, âI --â

âSorry,â said Dirk, âyouâll have to excuse me -- Iâve never cross-examined a four-billion-year-old ghost before. Are we talking Samuel Taylor here? Are you saying you told your story to Samuel Taylor Coleridge?â
âI was able to enter his mind at... certain times. When he was in an impressionable state.â
âYou mean when he was on laudanum?â said Richard. âThat is correct. He was more relaxed then.â
âIâll say,â snorted Reg, âI sometimes encountered him when he was quite astoundingly relaxed. Look, Iâll make some coffee.â
He disappeared into the kitchen, where he could be heard laughing to himself.
âItâs another world,â muttered Richard to himself, sitting down and shaking his head.
âBut unfortunately when he was fully in possession of himself I, so to speak, was not,â said the ghost, âand so that failed. And what he wrote was very garbled.â
âDiscuss,â said Richard, to himself, raising his eyebrows.
âProfessor,â called out Dirk, âthis may sound absurd. Did -- Coleridge ever try to... er... use your time machine? Feel free to discuss the question in any way which appeals to you.â
âWell, do you know,â said Reg, looking round the door, âhe did come in prying around on one occasion, but I think he was in a great deal too relaxed a state to do anything.â
âI see,â said Dirk. âBut why,â he added turning back to the strange figure of Michael slumped on its stool, âwhy has it taken you so long to find someone?â

âFor long, long periods I am very weak, almost totally non-existent, and unable to influence anything at all. And then, of course, before that time there was no time machine here, and... no hope for me at all --â
âPerhaps ghosts exist like wave patterns,â suggested Richard, âlike interference patterns between the actual with the possible. There would be irregular peaks and troughs, like in a musical waveform.â
The ghost snapped Michaelâs eyes around to Richard. âYou...â he said, âyou wrote that article...â
âEr, yes --â
âIt moved me very greatly,â said the ghost, with a sudden remorseful longing in his voice which seemed to catch itself almost as much by surprise as it did its listeners.
âOh. I see,â said Richard, âWell, thank you. You didnât like it so much last time you mentioned it. Well, I know that wasnât you as such - -â
Richard sat back frowning to himself.
âSo,â said Dirk, âto return to the beginning --â
The ghost gathered Michaelâs breath for him and started again. âWe were on a ship --â it said.
âA spaceship.â
âYes. Out from Salaxala, a world in... well, very far from here. A violent and troubled place. We -- a party of some nine dozen of us -- set out, as people frequently did, to find a new world for ourselves. All the planets in this system were completely unsuitable for our purpose, but we stopped on this world to replenish some necessary mineral supplies.
âUnfortunately our landing ship was damaged on its way into the

atmosphere. Damaged quite badly, but still quite reparable.
âI was the engineer on board and it fell to me to supervise the task of repairing the ship and preparing it to return to our main ship. Now, in order to
understand what happened next you must know something of the nature of a highly-automated society. There is no task that cannot be done more easily with the aid of advanced computerisation. And there were some very specific problems associated with a trip with an aim such as ours --â
âWhich was?â said Dirk sharply.
The ghost in Michael blinked as if the answer was obvious.
âWell, to find a new and better world on which we could all live in freedom, peace and harmony forever, of course,â he said.
Dirk raised his eyebrows.
âOh, that,â he said. âYouâd thought this all out carefully, I assume.â
âWeâd had it thought out for us. We had with us some very specialised devices for helping us to continue to believe in the purpose of the trip even when things got difficult. They generally worked very well, but I think we probably came to rely on them too much.â
âWhat on earth were they?â said Dirk.
âItâs probably hard for you to understand how reassuring they were. And that was why I made my fatal mistake. When I wanted to know whether or not it was safe to take off, I didnât want to know that it might not be safe. I just wanted to be reassured that it was. So instead of checking it myself, you see, I sent out one of the Electric Monks.â
CHAPTER 32
The brass plaque on the red door in Peckender Street glittered as it reflected the

yellow light of a street lamp. It glared for a moment as it reflected the violent flashing light of a passing police car sweeping by.
It dimmed slightly as a pale, pale wraith slipped silently through it. It glimmered as it dimmed, because the wraith was trembling with such terrible agitation.
In the dark hallway the ghost of Gordon Way paused. He needed something to lean on for support, and of course there was nothing. He tried to get a grip on himself, but there was nothing to get a grip on. He retched at the horror of what he had seen, but there was, of course, nothing in his stomach. He half stumbled, half swam up the stairs, like a drowning man trying to grapple for a grip on the water.
He staggered through the wall, through the desk, through the door, and tried to compose and settle himself in front of the desk in Dirkâs office.
If anyone had happened into the office a few minutes later -- a night cleaner perhaps, if Dirk Gently had ever employed one, which he didnât on the
grounds that they wished to be paid and he did not wish to pay them, or a burglar, perhaps, if there had been anything in the office worth burgling, which there wasnât -- they would have seen the following sight and been amazed by it.
The receiver of the large red telephone on the desk suddenly rocked and tumbled off its rest on to the desk top.
A dialling tone started to burr. Then, one by one, seven of the large, easily pushed buttons depressed themselves, and after the very long pause which the British telephone system allows you within which to gather your thoughts and forget who it is youâre phoning, the sound of a phone ringing at the other end of the line could be heard.
After a couple of rings there was a click, a whirr, and a sound as of a machine drawing breath. Then a voice started to say, âHello, this is Susan. I canât come to the phone right at the moment because Iâm trying to get an E flat right, but if youâd like to leave your name...â

âSo then, on the say so of an -- I can hardly bring myself to utter the words -- Electric Monk,â said Dirk in a voice ringing with derision, âyouattempt to launch theship and to yourutter astonishment it explodes. Since when -- ?â
âSince when,â said the ghost, abjectly, âI have been alone on this planet. Alone with the knowledge of what I had done to my fellows on the ship. All, all alone...â
âYes, skip that, I said,â snapped Dirk angrily. âWhat about the main ship? That presumably went on and continued its search for --â
âNo.â
âThen what happened to it?â
âNothing. Itâs still there.â
âStill there?â
Dirk leapt to his feet and whirled off to pace the room, his brow furiously furrowed.
âYes.â Michaelâs head drooped a little, but he looked up pitieously at Reg and at Richard. âAll of us were aboard the landing craft. At first I felt myself to be haunted by the ghosts of the rest, but it was only in my imagination. For millions of years, and then billions, I stalked the mud utterly alone. It is impossible for you to conceive of even the tiniest part of the torment of such eternity. Then,â he added, âjust recently life arose on the planet. Life. Vegetation, things in the sea, then, at last, you. Intelligent life. I turn to you to release me from the torment I have endured.â
Michaelâs head sank abjectly on to his chest for some few seconds. Then slowly, wobblingly, it rose and stared at them again, with yet darker fires in his eyes.
âTake me back,â he said, âI beg you, take me back to the landing craft. Let me

undo what was done. A word from me, and it can be undone, the repairs properly made, the landing craft can then return to the main ship, we can be on our way, my torment will be extinguished, and I will cease to be a burden to you. I beg you.â
There was a short silence while his plea hung in the air.
âBut that canât work, can it?â said Richard. âIf we do that, then this wonât have happened. Donât we generate all sorts of paradoxes?â
Reg stirred himself from thought. âNo worse than many that exist already,â he said. âIf the Universe came to an end every time there was some uncertainty about what had happened in it, it would never have got beyond the first picosecond. And many of course donât. Itâs like a human body, you see. A few cuts and bruises here and there donât hurt it. Not even major surgery if itâs done properly. Paradoxes are just the scar tissue. Time and space heal themselves up around them and people simply remember a version of events which makes as much sense as they require it to make.
âThat isnât to say that if you get involved in a paradox a few things wonât strike you as being very odd, but if youâve got through life without that already happening to you, then I donât know which Universe youâve been living in, but it isnât this one.â
âWell, if thatâs the case,â said Richard, âwhy were you so fierce about not doing anything to save the dodo?â
Reg sighed. âYou donât understand at all. The dodo wouldnât have died if I hadnât worked so hard to save the coelacanth.â
âThe coelacanth? The prehistoric fish? But how could one possibly affect the other?â
âAh. Now there youâre asking. The complexities of cause and effect defy analysis. Not only is the continuum like a human body, it is also very like a piece of badly put up wallpaper. Push down a bubble somewhere, another one pops up somewhere else. There are no more dodos because of my

interference. In the end I imposed the rule on myself because I simply couldnât bear it any more. The only thing that really gets hurt when you try and change time is yourself.â He smiled bleakly, and looked away.
Then he added, after a long momentâs reflection, âNo, it can be done. Iâm just cynical because itâs gone wrong so many times. This poor fellowâs story is a very pathetic one, and it can do no harm to put an end to his misery. It happened so very, very long ago on a dead planet. If we do this we will each remember whatever it is that has happened to us individually. Too bad if the rest of the world doesnât quite agree. It will hardly be the first time.â
Michaelâs head bowed.
âYouâre very silent, Dirk,â said Richard.
Dirk glared angrily at him. âI want to see this ship,â he demanded.
In the darkness, the red telephone receiver slipped and slid fitfully back across the desk. If anybody had been there to see it they might just have discerned a shape that moved it.
It shone only very faintly, less than would the hands of a luminous watch. It seemed more as if the darkness around it was just that much darker and the ghostly shape sat within it like thickened scar tissue beneath the surface of the night.
Gordon grappled one last time with the recalcitrant receiver. At length he got a final grip and slipped it up on to the top of the instrument.
From there it fell back on to its rest and disconnected the call. At the same moment the ghost of Gordon Way, his last call finally completed, fell back to his own rest and vanished.
CHAPTER 33
Swinging slowly round in the shadow of the Earth, just one more piece of

debris among that which floated now forever in high orbit, was one dark shape that was larger and more regularly formed than the rest. And far, far older.
For four billion years it had continued to absorb data from the world below it, scanning, analysing, processing. Occasionally it sent pieces back if it thought they would help, if it thought they might be received. But otherwise, it watched, it listened, it recorded. Not the lapping of a wave nor the beating of a heart escaped its attention.
Otherwise, nothing inside it had moved for four billion years, except for the air which circulated still, and the motes of dust within the air that danced and danced and danced and danced... and danced.
It was only a very slight disturbance that occurred now. Quietly, without fuss, like a dew drop precipitating from the air on to a leaf, there appeared in a wall which had stood blank and grey for four billion years, a door. A plain, ordinary white-panelled door with a small dented brass handle.
This quiet event, too, was recordedand incorporated in the continual stream ofdataprocessingthat the ship ceaselessly performed. Not only the arrival of the door, but the arrival of those behind the door, the way they looked, the way they moved, the way they felt about being there. All processed, all recorded, all transformed.
After a moment or two had passed, the door opened.
Within it could be seen a room unlike any on the ship. A room of wooden floors, of shabby upholstery, a room in which a fire danced. And as the fire danced, its data danced within the shipâs computers, and the motes of dust in the air also danced with it.
A figure stood in the doorway -- a large lugubrious figure with a strange light that danced now in its eyes. It stepped forward across the threshold into the ship, and its face was suddenly suffused with a calm for which it had longed but had thought never again to experience.Following him stepped out a smaller, older man with hair that was white and wayward. He stopped and blinked with wonder as he passed from out of the realm of his room and into

the realm of the ship. Following him came a third man, impatient and tense, with a large leather overcoat that flapped about him. He, too, stopped and was momentarily bewildered by something he didnât understand. With a look of deepest puzzlement on his face he walked forward and looked around at the grey and dusty walls of the ancient ship.
At last came a fourth man, tall and thin. He stooped as he walked out of the door, and then instantly stopped as if he had walked into a wall.
He had walked into a wall, of a kind.
He stood transfixed. If anyone had been looking at his face at that moment, it would have been abundantly clear to them that the single most astonishing event of this manâs entire existence was currently happening to him.
When slowly he began to move it was with a curious gait, as if he was swimming very slowly. Each tiniest movement of his head seemed to bring fresh floods of awe and astonishment into his face. Tears welled in his eyes, and he became breathless with gasping wonder.
Dirk turned to look at him, to hurry him along. âWhatâs the matter?â he called above the noise. âThe... music...â whispered Richard.
The air was full of music. So full it seemed there was room for nothing else. And each particle of air seemed to have its own music, so that as Richard moved his head he heard a new and different music, though the new and different music fitted quite perfectly with the music that lay beside it in the air.
The modulations from one to another were perfectly accomplished -- astonishing leaps to distant keys made effortlessly in the mere shifting of the head. New themes, new strands of melody, all perfectly and astoundingly proportioned, constantly involved themselves into the continuing web. Huge slow waves of movement, faster dances that thrilled through them, tiny

scintillating scampers that danced on the dances, long tangled tunes whose ends were so like their beginnings that they twisted around upon themselves, turned inside out, upside down, and then rushed off again on the back of yet another dancing melody in a distant part of the ship.
Richard staggered against the wall. Dirk hurried to grab him.
âCome on,â he said, brusquely, âwhatâs the matter? Canât you stand the music? Itâs a bit loud, isnât it? For Godâs sake, pull yourself together. Thereâs something here I still donât understand. Itâs not right. Come on --â
He tugged Richard after him, and then had to support him as Richardâs mind sank further and further under the overwhelming weight of music. The visions that were woven in his mind by the million thrilling threads of music as they were pulled through it, were increasingly a welter of chaos, but the more the chaos burgeoned the more it fitted with the other chaos, and the next greater chaos, until it all became a vast exploding ball of harmony expanding in his mind faster than any mind could deal with.
And then it was all much simpler.
A single tune danced through his mind and all his attention rested upon it. It was a tune that seethed through the magical flood, shaped it, formed it, lived through it hugely, lived through it minutely, was its very essence. It bounced and trilled along, at first a little tripping tune, then it slowed, then it danced again but with more difficulty, seemed to founder in eddies of doubt and confusion, and then suddenly revealed that the eddies were just the first ripples of a huge new wave of energy surging up joyfully from beneath.
Richard began very, very slowly to faint.
He lay very still.
He felt he was an old sponge steeped in paraffin and left in the sun to dry.

He felt like the body of an old horse burning hazily in the sun. He dreamed of oil, thin and fragrant, of dark heaving seas. He was on a white beach, drunk with fish, stupefied with sand, bleached, drowsing, pummelled with light, sinking, estimating the density of vapour clouds in distant nebulae, spinning with dead delight. He was a pump spouting fresh water in the springtime, gushing into a mound of reeking newmown grass. Sounds, almost unheard, burned away like distant sleep.
He ran and was falling. The lights of a harbour spun into night. The sea like a dark spirit slapped infinitesimally at the sand, glimmering, unconscious. Out where it was deeper and colder he sank easily with the heavy sea swelling like oil around his ears, and was disturbed only by a distant burr burr as of the phone ringing.
He knew he had been listening to the music of life itself. The music of light dancing on water that rippled with the wind and the tides, of the life that moved through the water, of the life that moved on the land, warmed by the light.
He continued to lie very still. He continued to be disturbed by a distant burr burr as of a phone ringing.
Gradually he became aware that the distant burr burr as of a phone ringing was a phone ringing.
He sat up sharply.
He was lying on a small crumpled bed in a small untidy panelled room that he knew he recognised but couldnât place. It was cluttered with books and shoes. He blinked at it and was blank.
The phone by the bed was ringing. He picked it up. âHello?â he said.
âRichard!â It was Susanâs voice, utterly distraught. He shook his head and had no recollection of anything useful.

âHello?â he said again.
âRichard, is that you? Where are you?â
âEr, hold on, Iâll go and look.â
He put the receiver down on the crumpled sheets, where it lay squawking, climbed shakily off the bed, staggered to the door and opened it.
Here was a bathroom. He peered at it suspiciously. Again, he recognised it but felt that there was something missing. Oh yes. There should be a horse in it. Or at least, there had been a horse in it the last time he had seen it. He crossed the bathroom floor and went out of the other door. He found his way shakily down the stairs and into Regâs main room.
He was surprised by what he saw when he got there.
CHAPTER 34
The storms of the day before, and of the day before that, and the floods of the previous week, had now abated. The skies still bulged with rain, but all that actually fell in the gathering evening gloom was a dreary kind of prickle.
Some wind whipped across the darkening plain, blundered through the low hills and gusted across a shallow valley where stood a structure, a kind of tower, alone in a nightmare of mud, and leaning.
It was a blackened stump of a tower. It stood like an extrusion of magma from one of the more pestilential pits of hell, and it leaned at a peculiar angle, as if oppressed by something altogether more terrible than its own considerable weight. It seemed a dead thing, long ages dead.
The only movement was that of a river of mud that moved sluggishly along the bottom of the valley past the tower. A mile or so further on, the river ran

down a ravine and disappeared underground.
But as the evening darkened it became apparent that the tower was not entirely without life. There was a single dim red light guttering deep within it.
It was this scene that Richard was surprised to see from a small white doorway set in the side of the valley wall, a few hundred yards from the tower.
âDonât step out!â said Dirk, putting up an arm, âThe atmosphere is poisonous. Iâm not sure whatâs in it but it would certainly get your carpets nice and clean.â
Dirk was standing in the doorway watching the valley with deep mistrust. âWhere are we?â asked Richard.
âBermuda,â said Dirk. âItâs a bit complicated.â
âThank you,â said Richard and walked groggily back across the room.âExcuse me,â he said to Reg, who was busy fussing round Michael Wenton-Weakes, making sure that the scuba diving suit he was wearing fitted snuggly everywhere, that the mask was secure and that the regulator for the air supply was working properly.
âSorry, can I just get past?â said Richard. âThanks.â
He climbed back up the stairs, went back into Regâs bedroom, sat shakily on the edge of the bed and picked up the phone again.
âBermuda,â he said, âitâs a bit complicated.â
Downstairs, Reg finished smearing Vaseline on all the joins of the suit and the few pieces of exposed skin around the mask, and then announced that all was ready.
Dirk swung himself away from the door and stood aside with the utmost bad

grace.
âWell then,â he said, âbe off with you. Good riddance. I wash my hands of the whole affair. I suppose we will have to wait here for you to send back the empty, for what itâs worth.â He stalked round the sofa with an angry gesture. He didnât like this. He didnât like any of it. He particularly didnât like Reg knowing more about space\time than he did. It made him angry that he didnât know why he didnât like it.
âMy dear fellow,â said Reg in a conciliatory tone, âconsider what a very small effort it is for us to help the poor soul. Iâm sorry if it seems to you an anti- climax after all your extraordinary feats of deduction. I know you feel that a mere errand of mercy seems not enough for you, but you should be more charitable.â
âCharitable, ha!â said Dirk. âI pay my taxes, what more do you want?â
He threw himself on to the sofa, ran his hands through his hair and sulked.
The possessed figure of Michael shook hands with Reg and said a few words of thanks. Then he walked stiffly to the door, turned and bowed to them both.
Dirk flung his head round and glared at him, his eyes flashing behind their spectacles and his hair flying wildly. The ghost looked at Dirk, and foramomentshivered insidewith apprehension. A superstitious instinct suddenly made the ghost wave. He waved Michaelâs hand round in a circle, three times, and then said a single word.
âGoodbye,â he said.
With that he turned again, gripped the sides of the doorway and stepped resolutely out into the mud, and into the foul and poisonous wind.
He paused for a moment to be sure that his footing was solid, that he had his balance, and then without another look back he walked away from them, out of the reach of the slimy things with legs, towards his ship.

âNow, what on earth did that mean?â said Dirk, irritably mimicking the odd triple wave.
Richard came thundering down the stairs, threw open the door and plunged into the room, wild-eyed.
âRoss has been murdered!â he shouted.
âWho the hellâs Ross?â shouted Dirk back at him.
âWhatsisname Ross, for Godâs sake,â exclaimed Richard, âthe new editor of Fathom.â
âWhatâs Fathom?â shouted Dirk again.
âMichaelâs bloody magazine, Dirk! Remember? Gordon chucked Michael off the magazine and gave it to this Ross guy to fun instead. Michael hated him for that. Well, last night Michael went and bloody murdered him!â
He paused, panting. âAt least,â he said, âhe was murdered. And Michael was the only one with any reason to.â
He ran to the door, looked out at the retreating figure disappearing into the gloom, and spun round again.
âIs he coming back?â said Richard.
Dirk leapt to his feet and stood blinking for a moment.
âThatâs it...â he said, âthatâs why Michael was the perfect subject. Thatâs what I should have been looking for. The thing the ghost made him do in order to establish his hold, the thing he had to be fundamentally willing to do, the thing that would match the ghostâs own purpose. Oh my dear God. He thinks weâve supplanted them and thatâs what he wants to reverse.
âHe thinks this is their world not ours. This was where they were going to settle and build their blasted paradise. It matches every step of the way.

âYou see,â he said, turning on Reg, âwhat we have done? I would not be surprised to discover that the accident your poor tormented soul out there is trying to reverse is the very thing which started life on this planet!â
He turned his eyes suddenly from Reg, who was white and trembling, back to Richard.
âWhen did you hear this?â he said, puzzled.
âEr, just now,â said Richard, âon... on the phone. Upstairs.â âWhat?â
âIt was Susan, I donât know how -- said she had a message on her answering machine telling her about it. She said the message... was from -- she said it was from Gordon, but I think she was hysterical. Dirk, what the hell is happening? Where are we?â
âWe are four billion years in the past,â said Reg in a shaking voice, âplease donât ask me why it is that the phone works when we are anywhere in the Universe other than where itâs actually connected, thatâs a matter you will have to take up with British Telecom, but --ââDamn and blast British Telecom,â shouted Dirk, the words coming easily from force of habit. He ran to the door and peered again at the dim shadowy figure trudging through the mud towards the Salaxalan ship, completely beyond their reach.
âHow long,â said Dirk, quite calmly, âwould you guess that itâs going to take that fat self deluding bastard to reach his ship? Because that is how long we have.
âCome. Let us sit down. Let us think. We have two minutes in which to decide what we are going to do. After that, I very much suspect that the three of us, and everything we have ever known, including the coelacanth and the dodo, dear Professor, will cease ever to have existed.â
He sat heavily on the sofa, then stood up again and removed Michaelâs

discarded jacket from under him. As he did so, a book fell out of the pocket.
CHAPTER 35
âI think itâs an appalling act of desecration,â said Richard to Reg, as they sat hiding behind a hedge.
The night was full of summer smells from the cottage garden, and the occasional whiff of sea air which came in on the light breezes that were entertaining themselves on the coast of the Bristol Channel.
There was a bright moon playing over the sea off in the distance, and by its light it was also possible to see some distance over Exmoor stretching away to the south of them.
Reg sighed.
âYes, maybe,â he said, âbut Iâm afraid heâs right, you know, it must be done. It was the only sure way. All the instructions were clearly contained in the piece once you knew what you were looking for. It has to be suppressed. The ghost will always be around. In fact two of him now. That is, assuming this works. Poor devil. Still, I suppose he brought it on himself.â
Richard fretfully pulled up some blades of grass and twisted them between his fingers.
He held them up to the moonlight, turned them to different angles, and watched the way light played on them.
âSuch music,â he said. âIâm not religious, but if I were I would say it was like a glimpse into the mind of God. Perhaps it was and I ought to be religious. I have to keep reminding myself that they didnât create the music, they only created the instrument which could read the score. And the score was life itself. And itâs all up there.â

He glanced into the sky. Unconsciously he started to quote:
âCould I revive within me
Her symphony and song
To such a deep delight âtwould win me
That with music loud and long
I would build that dome in air,
That sunny dome! Those caves of ice!â
âHmmm,â said Reg to himself, âI wonder if he arrived early enough.ââWhat did you say?â
âOh, nothing. Just a thought.â
âGood God, he can talk, canât he?â Richard exclaimed suddenly. âHeâs been in there over an hour now. I wonder whatâs going on.â
He got up and looked over the hedge at the small farm cottage basking in the moonlight behind them. About an hour earlier Dirk had walked boldly up to the front door and rapped on it.
When the door had opened, somewhat reluctantly, and a slightly dazed face had looked out, Dirk had doffed his absurd hat and said in a loud voice, âMr Samuel Coleridge?
âI was just passing by, on my way from Porlock, you understand, and I was wondering if I might trouble you to vouchsafe me an interview? Itâs just for a little parish broadsheet I edit. Wonât take much of your time I promise, I know you must be busy, famous poet like you, but I do so admire your work, and...â

The rest was lost, because by that time Dirk had effected his entry and closed the door behind him.
âWould you excuse me a moment?â said Reg.
âWhat? Oh sure,â said Richard, âIâm just going to have a look and see whatâs happening.â
While Reg wandered off behind a tree Richard pushed open the little gate and was just about to make his way up the path when he heard the sound of voices approaching the front door from within.
He hurriedly darted back, as the front door started to open.
âWell, thank you very much indeed, Mr Coleridge,â said Dirk, as he emerged, fiddling with his hat and bowing, âyou have been most kind and generous with your time, and I do appreciate it very much, as Iâm sure will my readers. Iâm
sure it will work up into a very nice little article, a copy of which you may rest assured I will send you for you to peruse at your leisure. I will most certainly welcome your comments if you have any, any points of style, you know, hints, tips, things of that nature. Well, thank you again, so much, for your time, I do hope I havenât kept you from anything important --â
The door slammed violently behind him.
Dirk turned with another in a long succession of triumphant beams and hurried down the path to Richard.
âWell, thatâs put a stop to that,â he said, patting his hands together, âI think heâd made a start on writing it down, but he wonât remember another word, thatâs for certain. Whereâs the egregious Professor? Ah, there you are. Good heavens, Iâd no idea Iâd been that long. A most fascinating and entertaining fellow, our Mr Coleridge, or at least Iâm sure he would have been if Iâd given him the chance, but I was rather too busy being fascinating myself.
âOh, but I did do as you asked, Richard, I asked him at the end about the

albatross and he said what albatross? So I said, oh it wasnât important, the albatross did not signify. He said what albatross didnât signify, and I said never mind the albatross, it didnât matter, and he said it did matter -- someone comes to his house in the middle of the night raving about albatrosses, he wanted to know why. I said blast the bloody albatross and he said he had a good mind to and he wasnât certain that that didnât give him an idea for a poem he was working on. Much better, he said, than being hit by an asteroid, which he thought was stretching credulity a bit. And so I came away.
âNow. Having saved the entire human race from extinction I could do with a pizza. What say you to such a proposal?â
Richard didnât offer an opinion. He was staring instead with some puzzlement at Reg.
âSomething troubling you?â said Reg, taken aback.
âThatâs a good trick,â said Richard, âI could have sworn you didnât have a beard before you went behind the tree.â
âOh --â Reg fingered the luxuriant three-inch growth -- âyes,â he said, âjust carelessness,â he said, âcarelessness.â
âWhat have you been up to?â
âOh, just a few adjustments. A little surgery, you understand. Nothing drastic.â
A few minutes later as he ushered them into the extra door that a nearby cowshed had mysteriously acquired, he looked back up into the sky behind them, just in time to see a small light flare up and disappear.
âSorry, Richard,â he muttered, and followed them in.

CHAPTER 36
âThank you, no,â said Richard firmly, âmuch as I would love the opportunity to buy you a pizza and watch you eat it, Dirk, I want to go straight home. I have to see Susan. Is that possible, Reg? Just straight to my flat? Iâll come up to Cambridge next week and collect my car.â
âWe are already there,â said Reg, âsimply step out of the door, and you are home in your own flat. It is early on Friday evening and the weekend lies before you.â
âThanks. Er, look, Dirk, Iâll see you around, OK? Do I owe you something? I donât know.â
Dirk waved the matter aside airily. âYou will hear from my Miss Pearce in due course,â he said.
âFine, OK, well Iâll see you when Iâve had some rest. Itâs been, well, unexpected.â
He walked to the door and opened it. Stepping outside he found himself halfway up his own staircase, in the wall of which the door had materialised.
He was about to start up the stairs when he turned again as a thought struck him. He stepped back in, closing the door behind him.
âReg, could we make one tiny detour?â he said. âI think it would be a good move if I took Susan out for a meal tonight, only the place I have in mind you have to book in advance. Could you manage three weeks for me?â
âNothing could be easier,â said Reg, and made a subtle adjustment to the disposition of the beads on the abacus. âThere,â he said, âWe have travelled backwards in time three weeks. You know where the phone is.âRichard hurried up the internal staircase to Regâs bedroom and phoned LâEsprit dâEscalier. The maÃ®tre dâ was charmed and delighted to take his reservation, and looked forward to seeing him in three weeksâ time. Richard went back downstairs shaking his head in wonder.

âI need a weekend of solid reality,â he said. âWho was that just going out of the door?â
âThat,â said Dirk, âwas your sofa being delivered. The man asked if we minded him opening the door so they could manoeuvre it round and I said we would be delighted.â
It was only a few minutes later that Richard found himself hurrying up the stairs to Susanâs flat. As he arrived at her front door he was pleased, as he always was, to hear the deep tones of her cello coming faintly from within. He quietly let himself in and then as he walked to the door of her music room he suddenly froze in astonishment. The tune she was playing was one he had heard before. A little tripping tune, that slowed, then danced again but with more difficulty...
His face was so amazed that she stopped playing the instant she saw him.
âWhatâs wrong?â she said, alarmed.
âWhere did you get that music?â said Richard in a whisper.
She shrugged. âWell, from the music shop,â she said, puzzled. She wasnât being facetious, she simply didnât understand the question.
âWhat is it?â
âItâs from a cantata Iâm playing in in a couple of weeks,â she said, âBach, number six.â
âWho wrote it?â
âWell, Bach I expect. If you think about it.â
âWho?â
âWatch my lips. Bach. B-A-C-H. Johannes Sebastian. Remember?â

âNo, never heard of him. Who is he? Did he write anything else?â
Susan put down her bow, propped up her cello, stood up and came over to him. âAre you all right?â she said.
âEr, itâs rather hard to tell. Whatâs...â
He caught sight of a pile of music books sitting in a corner of the room with the same name on the top one. BACH. He threw himself at the pile and started to scrabble through it. Book after book -- J. S. BACH. Cello sonatas. Brandenburg Concertos. A Mass in B Minor.
He looked up at her in blank incomprehension. âIâve never seen any of this before,â he said.
âRichard my darling,â she said, putting her hand to his cheek, âwhat on earthâs the matter? Itâs just Bach sheet music.â
âBut donât you understand?â he said, shaking a handful of the stuff. âIâve never, ever seen any of this before!â
âWell,â she said with mock gravity, âperhaps if you didnât spend all your time playing with computer music...â
He looked at her with wild surprise, then slowly he sat back against the wall and began to laugh hysterically.
On Monday afternoon Richard phoned Reg.
âReg!â he said. âYour phone is working. Congratulations.â
âOh yes, my dear fellow,â said Reg, âhow delightful to hear from you. Yes. A very capable young man arrived and fixed the phone a little earlier. I donât think it will go wrong again now. Good news, donât you think?â

âVery good. You got back safely then.â
âOh yes, thank you. Oh, we had high excitement here when we returned from dropping you off. Remember the horse? Well he turned up again with his owner. Theyâd had some unfortunate encounter with the constabulary and wished to be taken home. Just as well. Dangerous sort of chap to have on the loose I think. So. How are you then?
âReg... The music --â
âAh, yes, I thought youâd be pleased. Took a bit of work, I can tell you. I saved only the tiniest tiniest scrap, of course, but even so I cheated. It was rather more than one man could actually do in a lifetime, but I donât suppose anybody will look at that too seriously.ââReg, canât we get some more of it?â
âWell, no. The ship has gone, and besides --â
âWe could go back in time --â
âNo, well, I told you. Theyâve fixed the phone so it wonât go wrong again.â
âSo?â
âWell, the time machine wonât work now. Burnt out. Dead as a dodo. I think thatâs it Iâm afraid. Probably just as well, though, donât you think?â
On Monday, Mrs Sauskind phoned Dirk Gentlyâs Holistic Detective Agency to complain about her bill.
âI donât understand what all this is about,â she said, âitâs complete nonsense. Whatâs the meaning of it?â
âMy dear Mrs Sauskind,â he said, âI can hardly tell you how much I have been looking forward to having this exact same conversation with you yet again. Where shall we begin today? Which particular item is it that you would like to discuss?â
