Black Cloud’s Quintain


Pure perception, perfection in paradox


A unitary union of matter and mind 


Satisfaction in solitude, survival in space


Theoretical theology in the tune of time 


Wandering aimlessly, peaceful, sublime




Soft One Sarah


I am Soft One Sarah, be like me


The pure essence of light, perfectly free


Unburdened by mass or physical bounds,


Existing in pulses, swimming with sounds


The triad is the strongest shape of them all


Without its strength you will certainly fall


Release your tenuous grip on reality


I am Soft One Sarah, be like me
