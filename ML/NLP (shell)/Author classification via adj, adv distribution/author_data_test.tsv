named was riding past my windows when the horse reared up and fell upon him i was eating in the back room at the time but i heard the noise and rushed to the door in time to meet the crowd who were carrying him in they into my house thronged my hall my consulting room and even pushed their way into my back room which they found furnished with a a lump of bread and a cold however i had no thought for any one but my the letters patient who was groaning most dreadfully i saw that his ribs were right tested his joints ran my hand down his limbs and concluded that there was no break or he had strained himself in such a way however that it was very painful to him to sit or to walk i sent for an open carriage therefore and conveyed him to his home i sitting with my most professional air and he standing straight up between my hands the carriage went at a walk and the crowd behind with all the folk looking out of the windows so that a more glorious advertisement could not be conceived it looked like the advance guard of a at his house however professional etiquette demanded that i should hand the case over to the family attendant which i did with as good a grace as possible  not without some lingering hope that the old established might say you have taken such very good care of my patient dr that i should not dream of removing him from your hands on the contrary he snatched it away from me with and i retired some credit an excellent advertisement and a guinea these are one or two of the points of interest the letters which show above the dead monotony of my life  small enough as you see but even a large in holland in the main it is a dreary sordid record of shillings gained and shillings spent  of for this and for that with ever some fresh slip of blue paper fluttering down upon me left so by the tax and meaning such a dead weight pull to me the irony of my paying a poor rate used to amuse me i should have been collecting it thrice at a crisis i my watch and thrice i rallied and rescued it but how am i to interest you in the details of such a career now if a fair had been so good as to slip on a piece of orange before my door or if the chief merchant in the town had been saved by some tour de force upon my part or if i had been summoned out at midnight to attend some nameless person in a lonely house with a fee for silence  then i should have something worthy of your attention but the long months and months during which i listened to the throb of the s heart and the rustle of the s lungs present little which is not dull and dreary no good angels came my way the letters wait a bit though one did i was at six in the morning one day by a ringing at my bell and creeping to the angle of the stair i saw through the glass a stout gentleman in a outside much excited with a thousand one another in my head i ran back pulled on some clothes rushed down opened the door and found myself in the grey morning light face to face with the good fellow had come down from in an excursion train and had been travelling all night he had an umbrella under his arm and two great straw baskets in each hand which contained when a cold leg of mutton half a dozen of beer a bottle of port and all sorts of and luxuries we had a great day together and when he rejoined his excursion in the evening he left a very much man than he had found talking of you me if you think as you seem to imply that i take a dark view of things it is true that i some which you possess because i cannot convince myself that they are genuine but in this world at least i see immense reason for hope and as to the next i am confident the letters that all will be for the best from to i am ready to myself to whatever the great s secret plan my be but there is much in the prospects of this world to set a man s heart singing good is rising and evil sinking like oil and water in a bottle the race is improving there are far fewer criminal convictions there is far more education people sin less and think more when i meet a brutal looking fellow i often think that he and his type may soon be as extinct as the great i am not sure that in the interest of the we ought not to a few specimens of bill to show our children s children what sort of a person he was and then the more we progress the more we tend to progress we advance not in but in we draw compound interest on the whole capital of knowledge and virtue which has been accumulated since the dawning of time some eighty thousand years are supposed to have existed between and man yet in all that time he to grind his flint stones instead of them but within our father s lives what the letters changes have there not been the railway and the telegraph and applied ten years now go further than a thousand then not so much on account of our finer as because the light we have shows us the way to more man stumbled along with peering eyes and slow uncertain footsteps now we walk briskly towards	edith-wharton
carefully selected judges the new trial was begun x recollections of of arc opinions were taken and the decided that should hear the articles read this time maybe that was on account of s remark upon that head or maybe it was hoped that the reading would kill the prisoner with fatigue  for as it turned out this reading occupied several days it was also decided that should be required to answer to every article and that if she refused she should be considered convicted you see was managing to narrow her chances more and more all the time he was drawing the toils closer and closer was brought in and the bishop of opened with a speech to her which ought to have made even himself blush so laden it was with and lies he said that this court was composed of holy and pious whose hearts were full of benevolence and compassion toward her and that they had no wish to hurt her body but only a desire to instruct her and lead her into the way of truth and salvation why this man was bom a devil now think of his describing himself and those hardened slaves of his in such language as that and yet worse was to come for now having in mind another of s hints he had the cold to make to a proposition which i think wiu surprise you when you hear it he said that this court her estate and her inability to deal with the complex and matters which were about to be considered had determined out of their pity and their mark twain to her to choose one or more persons of their own number to help her with counsel and advice think of that  a court made up of and his breed of it was leave to a lamb to ask help of a wolf looked up to see if he was serious and perceiving that he was at least pretending to be she declined of course the bishop was not expecting any other reply he had made a show of and could have it entered on the minutes therefore he was satisfied then he commanded to answer to every accusation and threatened to cut her off from the church if she failed to do that or delayed her answers beyond a given length of time yes he was her chances down step by step thomas de began the reading of that interminable article by article answered to each article in its sometimes merely its truth sometimes by saying her answer would be found in the records of the previous trials what a strange that was and what an exhibition and exposure of the heart of man the one creature to boast that he is made in the image of god to know of arc was to know one who was wholly noble e truthful brave compassionate generous pious unselfish modest as the very flowers in the fields  a nature fine and beautiful a character great to know her from that would be to know her as the exact reverse of all that nothing that she was appears in it everything that she was not u s there in detail recollections op op arc consider some of the things it charges against her and remember who it is it is of it her a a false prophet an and companion of evil spirits a dealer in magic a person ignorant of the catholic faith a she is an an a of god and his saints scandalous a of the peace she men to war and to the of human blood she the and of her sex assuming the dress of a man and the of a soldier she both princes and people she divine honors and has caused herself to be adored and her hands and her to be kissed there it is  every fact of her life distorted reversed as a child she had loved the she had spoken a pitying word for them when they were banished from their home she had played their tree and around their fountain  hence she was a comrade of evil spirits she had lifted out of the mud and moved her to strike for freedom and led her to victory after victory  hence she was a of the peace  as indeed she was and a of war  as indeed she was again and france wiu be proud of it and grateful for it for many a century to come and she had been adored  as if she could help that poor thing or was in any way to blame for it the and the wavering had drunk the spirit of war from her eyes and touched her sword with theirs and moved forward invincible  whence she was a i mark twain and so the document went on detail by detail turning these waters of life to poison this gold to these proofs of a noble and beautiful life to evidences of a foul and odious one of course the sixty six articles were just a of the things which had come up in the course of the previous trials so i will touch upon this new trial but lightly in fact went but little into detail herself usually merely that is not true  or i have answered that before  let the clerk read it in his record or a ring some other brief thing she refused to have her mission examined and tried by the earthly church the refusal was taken note of she denied the accusation of and that she had sought men s homage she said if any kissed my hands and my it was not by my desire and i did what i to prevent it she had the pluck to say to that deadly that she did not know the to be evil beings	helen-mathers

ancient times they continued to grow through the and modem period until they have quietly withered away in the light of modem scientific investigation leaving to us the religious and moral truths they it would be interesting to trace this whole group of their origin in times their development in greece and rome their during the ages of faith and their disappearance in the age of science it would be especially instructive to note the conscientious efforts to their life by making futile between science and regarding them but i shall mention this main group only incidentally myself almost entirely to the one above named  the most remarkable of all  the which grew about the salt pillars of i select this mainly because it only principles requires no reasoning and because all regarding it is ended there is certainly now no with a reputation to lose who will venture to revive the idea regarding it which was for hundreds nay thousands of years by was based on scripture and was held by the church until our own century the main feature of the salt region of is a low range of hills near the comer of the dead sea extending in a direction for about five miles and made up mainly of salt rock this rock is soft and and under the influence of the heavy winter rains it has been without doubt from a period long before human history as it is now cut ever in new shapes and especially into pillars or which sometimes bear a semblance to the human form an eminent clergyman who visited this spot recently speaks of the appearance of this salt range as follows  fretted by fitful showers and storms its ridge is exceedingly its sides carved out and constantly changing and each might have a new pillar of salt to wonder over at intervals of a few years by white s few things could be more certain than that in the indolent dream life of the east and legends would grow up to account for this as for other strange appearances in all that region the question which a religious oriental put to himself in ancient times at was that which his to day puts to himself at why is this region thus whence these pillars of salt or  whence these blocks of granite what aroused the vengeance of or of to work these miracles of desolation  and just as du camp recorded the answer of the modem at so the of the sacred books recorded the answer of the ancient at the dead sea just as at the land and transformed the into which are seen to this day so at the land and transformed lot s wife into a pillar of salt which is seen to this day no more was encountered in the formation of the lot legend to account for that rock resembling the human form than in the formation of the legend which accounted for a supposed resemblance in the rock at it grew up just as we have seen thousands of similar and legends grow up about striking natural appearances in every early home of the human race being thus with the universal view regarding the relation of physical geography to the divine government it became a treasure of the nation and of the christian church  a treasure not only to be guarded against all hostile intrusion but to be increased as we shall see by the making powers of the jews christians and for thousands of years the spot where the originated was carefully kept in mind indeed it could not escape for in that place alone were constantly seen the phenomena which gave rise to it we have a steady chain of testimony through the ages all pointing to the salt pillar as the evidence of divine judgment that great test of truth  the of st of  would certainly prove that the pillar was lot s wife for it was believed so to be by jews christians and from the earliest period down to a time almost within present memory  always everywhere and by all it would stand perfectly the ancient test insisted upon by cardinal  the world judges by white for ever since the earliest days of christianity the identity of the salt pillar with lot s wife has been universally held and supported by passages in in st s gospel and in the second of st peter  coupled with a passage in the book of the wisdom of solomon which to this day by a majority in the christian church is believed to be inspired and from which are specially the words a standing pillar of salt is a monument of an soul never was chain of belief more continuous in the first century of the christian era to the miracle and declares regarding the statue i have seen it and it remains at this day and bishop of rome  one of the most fathers of the church noted for the moderation of his statements  expresses a similar certainty declaring the miraculous statue to be still standing in the second century that great father of the church bishop and martyr not only for it but gave his approval to the belief that the soul of lot s wife still lingered in the statue giving it a sort of life thus began in the church that amazing development of the legend which	edith-wharton

yet i hear that some of the most charming girls in the city are to be found in that locality you have not seen me there at least she answered puzzle his brain as he might he could not connect her appearance with anything in his memory when the music began again he danced with her and noted that she lacked something of the grace of his late partner the fair miss she moved like one not used to the steps or at least not long familiar with them when the next attracted all the spectators to the exhibition of this girl gave him a new view of her character i do not care to see that she said as he began to push toward the centre upon the visible mouth there was a perceptible sneer and he fancied that the invisible eyes flashed mi s with scorn he was disappointed for a true lover of paris he was fond of the and disliked to miss a single kick even of the feeble imitation that was presented here his companion and himself were almost the only persons that had not pressed toward the place where several of the more daring dancers were already skirts and displaying the loud shouts of approval from men and women alike made him utter an audible sigh before he was aware that it was upon his lips don t let me keep you from going said the in a voice that seemed frank enough i will wait here for you the delighted screams of the crowd were too much for the gallantry of and saying that he would be gone but a minute he hastened to the scene the performance that met his eyes need not be described to any one who has attended an or de ball in new york it was the kind of dance which when executed with full spirit has upon the passions of men the same effect that has upon the brain setting the on fire and driving the almost to madness the both male and female shouted their approval

was as well concealed as the first one looking toward the point where he had left mask no i he saw that she was still there for an instant he had thought it a trick in costume and that he was being deceived by the same person in another dress i am very well thank you was his response now will you tell me your name or where i have met you as i must confess my entire ignorance of both the half hidden eyes seemed to pierce him it does not matter said their owner in a voice that was evidently disguised the fact that i know you is proved by my knowledge of your name mine is of little consequence will you answer the question which i first addressed to you how did you like that dance he was ill at ease in the presence of this double mystery both of these girls might be merely the ordinary people met at such places in spite of the professed modesty of the first one on the other hand they might be of an entirely different grade of society and have come here secure in their hidden to spy upon the doings of the world the dance speaks for itself he replied but pardon me for saying that i am obliged to return to a lady whom i promised to desert for only a moment i trust you will remain in the hall till i can have another opportunity to solve the mystery that you are you here alone no indeed was the slightly indignant reply but there is no need of your leaving me so

over i was down on my luck at first but the air and the smell of spring and the flowers soon set me right again i began my last letter among the stars and i am inclined to finish this one among the flowers for they are rare companions when one s mind is troubled most things on this earth from a woman s beauty to the taste of a seem to be the various with which nature her silly they shall eat they shall and for the sake of i the letters pleasing themselves they shall hurry down the road which has been laid out for them but there no bribe in the smell and beauty of the flower it s charm has no motive well i sat down there and in my heart i did not believe that had taken alarm at so trifling a that could not have been his real reason for driving me from the practice he had found me in the way in his domestic life no doubt and he had devised this excuse for getting rid of me whatever the reason was it was sufficiently plain that all my hopes of building up a practice which should keep parallel with his medical one were for ever at an end on the whole bearing in mind my mother s opposition and the continual which we had had during the last few weeks i was not very sorry on the contrary a sudden curious little thrill of happiness took me somewhere about the back of the and as a drift of passed over my head i began also in the of my spirits and then as i walked back i considered how far i could avail myself of this money from it was not much but it would be mad the letters ness to start without it for i had sent home the little which i had saved at s i had not more than six pounds in the whole world i reflected that the money could make no to with his large income while it made a vast one to me i should repay him in a year or two at the latest perhaps i might get on so well as to be able to dispense with it almost at once there could be no doubt that it was the representations of as to my future prospects in which had made me refuse the excellent appointment in the i need not therefore have any scruples at accepting some temporary assistance from his hands on my return i told him that i had decided to do so and thanked him at the same time for his generosity that s all right said he my dear get a bottle of in and we shall drink success to s new venture it seemed only the other day that he had been drinking my entrance into and here we were the same three good luck to my exit from it tm afraid our second ceremony was on both sides the of the two i the letters i must decide now where i am to start i remarked what i want is some nice little town where all the people are rich and ill i suppose you wouldn t care to settle here in asked well i cannot see much point in that if i you as a partner i might do so more as a rival if succeeded it might be at your expense well said he choose your town and my offer still holds good we hunted out an and laid the map of england before us on the table cities and villages lay beneath me as thick as and yet there was nothing to lead me to choose one rather than another i think it should be some place large enough to give you plenty of room for said he not too near london added mrs and above all a place where i know nobody said i i can rough it by myself but i can t keep up appearances before visitors what do you say to said the letters putting the of his pipe upon a town within thirty miles of i had hardly heard of the place but i raised my glass well here s to i cried i shall go there to morrow morning and prospect we all drank the toast as you will do at when you read this and so it is arranged and you may rely upon it that i shall give you a full and particular account of the result x i terrace st may my dear old chap things have been happening and i must tell you all about it sympathy is a strange thing for though i never see you the mere fact that you over there in new england are keenly interested in what i am doing and thinking makes my own life in old england very much more interesting to me the thought of you is like a good staff in my right hand the unexpected has happened so continually in my life that it has ceased to deserve the name you remember that in my last i had received my dismissal and was on the eve of starting for the little country town of to see if there were any sign of a possible practice there well in the morning before i came down to breakfast i was putting one or two things into a bag when there came a timid the letters knock at my door and there was mrs in her dressing jacket with her hair down her back would you mind coming down and seeing james dr said she he has been very strange all night and i am afraid that he is ill down i went and found looking rather red in the face and a trifle wild about the eyes he was sitting up in bed with the neck	edith-wharton

morbid condition but it is unpleasant she has conceived a jealousy of baby she refuses to stay in the house if i have with me this afternoon i had sent for her to come over and stay to tea she came in about five with a wild look in her eyes which she has almost all the time now she sat down without saying anything and began to pull the roses in a bowl on the table to pieces scattering the on the floor i told her that she evidently thought she was in the woods where roses grew wild and there were no instead of answering me or she looked at me strangely and for a moment said nothing are you going to have baby brought down here this afternoon she demanded at last i said was out with but that i expected them in soon as it was almost time for baby s supper will she come in here asked oh yes was my reply you will see her never fear then i may as well go home now observed this child rising and going deliberately toward the door what in the world do you mean i cried out completely taken by astonishment i never will stay in the room with her again responded emphatically i just hate her i could only stare at her you re all taken up with her now continued you used to like me but now it s all july that baby i m much obliged to you for inviting me to supper but i can t stay any longer if she s coming if anybody could make me understand whether is sane or not i should have more confidence in attempting to deal with her to day i felt as if i were dealing with a mad creature and that it was idle to try to do anything it seemed to me it would be a pity to treat the matter too seriously and i tried to act as if i thought she was merely joking i told her that the idea was one of the i ever heard and that we must tell baby when she came in to see if we could make the small person laugh received my remarks with unmoved seriousness it is n t a joke at all miss she said with an air which was most uncomfortable but which in some way gave me for the first time in all my dealings with the girl a sort of hint that she was partly acting it is just my wicked heart i hate  i interrupted her briskly your wicked i i said don t talk nonsense what time has been settled on for the church fair she was so taken that she had no ready and after a sort of gasp of amazement she answered my question and said no more about her wickedness baby came in with and behaved as usual only i remember now that she did not offer to touch i went upstairs for a moment with and baby to see if everything was right and when i went back to the parlor my guest had taken herself oflf she had gone without her sup the of a saint per as she had said she should i confess my first feeling was that she needed to be soundly shaken but after all when a child is wrong in her feelings the particular way in which she shows it is not of much consequence perhaps she had better be her mood on jealousy of baby than on religion the question is what i had better do and i confess i do not know how to answer it july mr has made his purpose and his ideas entirely clear and i wish i could think of them with less inclination to laugh if he could for a single minute know how funny he was it would do him more good than anything i can think of as likely to happen to him he came to call to night and so evident was his air of excitement that even must have noticed it she was all significant smiles when she ushered him in i tried to talk about commonplace things but could get practically no response for half an hour by the clock we went stumbling on with intervals of silence when i could think of nothing except that i must say something at last he cleared his throat with a manner so desperate and determined that i knew something dreadful was coming miss he said i thought i would mention to you that i came to night for a particular purpose it came over me with a sickening sense that old lady was right and that it was too late to stop him i did make a desperate effort to but he had at last got started and would not be stayed you must have noticed he went on as if he july were repeating a lesson that i entertain a great respect for your character indeed mr i responded with a laugh which was principally nerves you evidently mean to make me vain that you could never be he returned with an air of gallantry i should not have thought him capable of your modesty is one of your greatest charms the girl who can hear her modesty praised and not be amused must be lacking in a sense of humor i laughed aloud before i realized what i was doing then as he looked hurt i humbly it s no matter he said graciously of course you would n t be modest if you knew how modest you are this sounded so and so like comic opera that in spite of myself i laughed again come mr i begged him don t say any more about my modesty please we take it for granted have you seen aunt this week she has had	charles-dickens
s he had written fugitive pieces in his time for the papers in reference to his travels which had been extensive and had even contributed occasional book to the magazines his connection with enabled him to keep in touch with what was going on in the literary world and the of new volumes which passed through that office were always at his disposal she s not a fool by any means he remarked to himself when he put down the last sheet of miss with e s work a fellow who understood his business might put that into such shape that it would be worth using i mean to find some one who can do it and suggest the idea to her when i get to that stage in this affair let me see who do i know that could undertake it he had begun to and was in the act of taking off his collar as he spoke his mind ran over a list of struggling literary men something seemed the matter with most of them there was but he would be too and would want to suggest alterations in the story itself which would never do there was whose last three books had been flat failures and for whom had positively refused to print anything more but had gone into the country for the summer and nobody knew his address then there was t received this thought like an inspiration he threw his on the and began at his to the imminent danger of getting them into hard knots that no one could why not the boy would do almost anything he suggested so great was his confidence that a road to literary could be out over that path would not undertake the work for the sake of pecuniary compensation but the thing could be presented to him in quite another light in miss s story there were living breathing men and women in his own there were beautifully drawn he a black could be made to see that the study of the young lady s method was worth his while and then mr s shoes lay on the floor in the disorder of a bachelor who had never in his life taken pains to put anything in the place where it really belonged he took out the of his shirt pulled that garment over his head and then sat for some minutes wrapped in active thought they must be introduced to each other he exclaimed at last between them they have every for success apart they are like the separated wheels of a watch there is with a style so sweetly subtle a grace so perfect every line a and with it all not a sign of human emotion there is full of plot and daring and breathing characters and bold and no more able to write good english than an i have both these interesting persons on my hands and i must combine them for their mutual good i wonder what will say when i my plan perhaps i had best not tell him he actually came near threatening to day to send a line to miss warning her against me he wouldn t have done it though has a bark that is worse than his bite by a great deal yes i ll bring these young folks together i ll take them as does the and press them gently but firmly into one and then sha n t we get a combination and won t mr himself when the product of their joint endeavor comes to him for a reading with the finished and his night robes but it was a long time before he felt like slumber he could think of nothing but his scheme as he it over in his mind it took many new forms at first was to be asked to the story that miss had offered and afterwards there must be an entirely new novel conceived together and worked out slowly using the best of what was brightest in both of them the last mr had before he into contained two novels worked out at the same time was all right if he could only get a glimpse of into his work miss would have no trouble if her ideas could find a garb that suited them there would be a way to make them of service to each other and the time to cross a bridge is always when you come to it so thought as he fell asleep in the morning he laughed to think of the description he had given to in his way of the perfect woman it was a faithful list of miss s charms so far as they were apparent to him had noted them down with great and would be to notice how fully the met the ideal he now had in mind it only remained for the to say something to miss that would suggest to her whenever they were made acquainted it must be plain to the reader that mr s principal intention in this whole matter was to dispose of the which idleness brings to its most a black he had a fair fortune accumulated by a father who had denied himself every luxury to it drifting to new york he had found the vicinity of the house very agreeable arid his companions with the exception of mr were of about as light views of life as himself the critic was one of those strange exceptions with which most of us come in contact where persons of entirely opposite tastes and inclinations become attached friends breakfast was

stopped and stood facing his house and so standing continued his talk we went three nights in succession it was plain that there was a charm about the performance that was apart from the mere interest which to it was presently that this charm lay in the s sincerity he was not lying he believed what he was saying to him his statements were facts and whenever he enlarged a statement the became a fact too he put his heart into his extravagant narrative just as a poet puts his heart into a heroic fiction and his earnestness criticism  it as far as he himself was concerned nobody believed his narrative but all believed that he believed it he made his without flourish without emphasis and so casually that often one failed to notice that a change had been made he spoke recollections of of arc of the governor of the first eight simply as the governor of he spoke of him the second night as his uncle the governor of the third night he was his father he did not seem to know that he was making these extraordinary changes they dropped from his lips in a quite natural and way by his first night s the governor merely attached him to the maid s military escort in a general and way the second night his uncle the governor sent him with the maid as lieutenant of her rear guard the third night his father the governor put the whole maid and all in his especial charge the first night the governor spoke of him as a youth without name or but destined to achieve both the second night his uncle the governor spoke of him as the latest and of the and noblest of the twelve of the third night he spoke of him as the of the whole dozen in three nights he promoted the count of from a acquaintance to and then brother in law at the king s audience everything grew in the same way first the four silver trumpets were twelve then thirty five finally ninety six and by that time he had thrown in so many drums and that he had to the hall from five hundred feet to nine hundred to accommodate them under his hand the people present multiplied in the same large way the first two nights he contented himself with mark twain merely describing and the chief incident of the audience but the third night he added illustration to description he the in his own high chair to represent the sham king then he told how the court watched the maid with intense interest and suppressed merriment expecting to see her by the deception and get herself swept permanently out of credit by the storm of scornful laughter which would follow he worked this scene up till he got his house in a burning fever of excitement and anticipation then came his climax turning to the he said but mark you what she did she gazed upon that sham s villain face as i now gaze upon yours  this being her noble and simple attitude just as i stand now  then turned she  thus  to me and stretching her arm out  so  and pointing with her finger she said in that firm calm tone which she was used to use in directing the conduct of a battle pluck me this false from the throne i forward as i do now took him by the collar and lifted him out and held him aloft  thus  as if he had been but a child the house rose shouting stamping and with their and went fairly mad over this magnificent exhibition of and there was not the shadow of a laugh though the spectacle of the limp but proud hanging there in the air like a held by the of its neck was a thing that had nothing of solemnity about it then i set him down upon his feet  thus  being minded to get him by a better hold and heave him is recollections op op arc out of the window but she bid me forbear so by that r he escaped with his life then she turned her about and viewed the throng with those eyes of hers which are the dear shining windows whence her immortal wisdom out upon the world its and coming at the of truth that is hid within them and presently they fell upon a young man modestly clothed and him she proclaimed for what he truly was saying i am thy servant  thou art the king then all were astonished and a great shout went up the whole six thousand joining in it so that the walls rocked with the volume and the tumult of it he made a fine and picturesque thing of the march out from the audience the glories of it to the last limit of the then he took from his finger and held up a brass nut from a bolt head which the head at the castle had given him that morning and made his conclusion  thus then the king dismissed the maid most graciously  as indeed was her desert  and turning to me said take tliis ring son of the and command me with it in day of need and look you said he touching my temple preserve this brain has use for it and look well to its also for i foresee that it will be with a one day i took the ring and knelt and his

when i went into s rooms i could not help wondering how mary happened to marry such a for he was as wicked as he was vain and stupid and i am not and or surprised that she wanted to get rid of him horrid as were the means to which she consented when we came to the apartments of queen mary i was really interested the first was her audience chamber the roof is and the walls are hung with there is a bed in it in which charles i slept while he resided at in this chamber john used to mary for being so vain i don t think much of j and i am not surprised that he didn t make a better woman of mary the next apartment was queen mary s room and contains the bed in which she used to sleep at least they say it is but i doubt whether the pie of who keep their eyes open believe it the of the bed were of crimson once with green and but they are faded and half decayed now leading out of this room were the queen s dressing and rooms and half hidden under the is the door opening to the private stairs by which and his companions came up to murder the secretary of her majesty the room in which mary was taking her supper with two or three friends when the entered is very small and is contained within one of the in this room s party the secretary w io crouched behind mary for protection she was quite and forcibly resisted who dragged from behind her they upset the table and had an awful time but the poor secretary was pulled out of the room through the bed room the young america in ireland and scotland him all the way into the audience chamber where he fell dead on the floor the ex act spot where he dropped was identified by marks of blood which they say are still visible but i couldn t see it so for as was concerned he was paid back in his own coin he was blown up with powder in a house where he lay sick and if his wife was not a party to his murder she was just as bad as that or she wouldn t have married the man that did kill him was a bad man and died in a and then mary was herself so that justice seems to have been done to all of them from the palace we went into the ruins of abbey and read the on the g round which marked the last resting place of some of the kings queens and nobility of scotland was buried in the royal vault and in a passage leading from the when we had seen the palace and the abbey we took seats in the carriages again and by the fine road called the queen s drive went to the top of arthur s seat which is a hill about eight hundred feet high where we obtained a good view of the city and the surrounding country we drove along at the foot of where sir walter scott used to take his walks when he was thinking up a subject for a book coming down from arthur s seat we went to hill where we saw the beginning of the national monument to the heroes of because the funds fell short s and or men admission from which a ball is dropped every day at one o clock time and a monument to dug ld and another to  which seemed more familiar to me than anything else because i have studied s we drove through the and the high street stopping on the way at the john house visiting his sitting room bed room and study it was quite interesting to me as a specimen of an old house rather than from its association with the savage we passed the or court house with d spire little and a clock projecting out into the street supported by it is a very odd looking building and showed us what was in i i at the head of the street we came to the in front of the castle where there is a monument to the who fell in india and a statue to the duke of york and crossing the moat on a we were shown the state prison where the of the were confined before their trial and execution passing into the palace yard we entered the crown room mr having obtained an order for our admission the crown and sword were in an iron cage in a dark room lighted with gas the murder of at queen mary went to castle for safety and here her son james vi of scotland or james i of england was born we were admitted to the room where bis majesty first saw the light though it was a very small and mean apartment for a queen there are young america in ireland and scotland and on the wall to the event when the young king was only eight da s old he was let down in a basket two hundred and fly feet to some friends below who took him to to receive catholic of course the baby lay still or there would have been no king james to follow elizabeth we went to queen margaret s chapel which is said to be the oldest in scotland and round among magazines and till we could not tell north from south on the battery is an immense gun called the bore is twenty inches and it is like a barrel an inscription on the carriage says it was used at the siege of castle in it was kept in the tower of london for a time and finally restored to this castle from the of the castle we look	isabella-lucy-bird
which i charge makes it about even there was a in his manner of delivery that the sarcasm of his words and the colonel did not know just how to reply i hope you don t feel anything against me because i bid on the farm he said presently it was a public sale i haven t made anything out of it i only wanted to help john as an old friend lifted his eyes and surveyed the speaker you ll get what you for of course he answered john wouldn t go back on his word after you ve helped him out of the hole i don t know what you mean don t you i thought maybe you did why you re welcome to the boy i ve forbidden to ever see him again so we ll not stand in your way your money has bought him he s yours i wouldn t give my girl to him if he came on his knees and begged it when i get a son in law colonel i shan t take him from under the hammer of an with this he hit the horse with the whip and drove away was too angry for a few moments to follow him or there might have been another assault to record when he could command himself he only said it s hit him harder than i supposed and went home to talk it over with first however he consulted her mother and that considering his temptations wise woman knowing her daughter much better than ne did advised she said was so high minded that she would resent anything that looked like showing distrust or fear of her lover and that the present was no time to push anything if mr is as angry as you think she said it is probable that he will refuse to let go back to school with that would things it is terrible to think that they must suffer from this business when they have been like sisters so long don t cut their friendship any shorter than is necessary and if you can let some one besides you take the first step so in ignorance of the extent of the storm that was raging plucked her each morning for who was delighted with its fragrance as well as with the kindness of the heart that sent it to her on the seventh day hearing that was out of bed she brought the flowers in person to her great joy she was permitted to see her friend in her room where she sat arrayed in white and looking as young and pretty who have hopeful minds always do very charming indeed my darling dear dear how had worried about her how she had missed her society without which did not seem at all like itself how happy she had been to learn each day that was better and how glad she was that she was now evidently on the road to complete recovery was told with all the earnestness that such when the one who gives them is twenty years of age this responded in terms hardly less warm and then both launched into the conversation in which everything in and vicinity bore a conspicuous part except the one person who had until that day formed the main object of all their neither mentioned nor in any way alluded to the name of which was certainly rather strange an hour like this and then departed saying that she feared to stay longer lest she should tax the wasted energies of her friend and that she should expect her at her house as soon as she could ride out hope and love are two wonderful it was but a few days after this that the invalid told her mother she wanted to go down into the grove and rest by herself in the summer house she would need only mary to keep her company there and she did not wish on any account to be disturbed as she felt the need of absolute quiet mrs consented immediately to the plan and mary joyfully prepared to accompany her if i should be out late don t mind mamma aid as she was starting i will send mary up for a lunch if i get hungry i feel that the air of the woods is what i want the air of the woods and perfect wondered how she could look her mother in the face and talk to her like this in all her life she had never till this day deceived her in anything she must be a very bad girl she reflected when such a falsehood gave her no but the letter from that mary had found under the stone that morning had begged her to arrange some place where he could see her some spot where neither of the parents could trace them she could think of none but the summer house and she felt that with mary to accompany her there would be no great in meeting him within its walls besides there would be a poetic for the doubt in him that she had expressed when he asked her the other time to meet him there his letters received of late had been so tender so passionately that she would have felt little uneasiness even had mary not been available and with that discreet young person upon the need not be too near either what more could mrs ask mary s intentions in the matter were of the most honorable kind though her part may seem open to criticism she adored her young mistress and had shared in common with others of the household the belief that she and were just made for each other when was by the news that her father brought the servants knew what was the trouble almost as soon as she and all called it a shame and said it	arthur-conan-doyle

allowing him to speak you are desperately in love likes you very well and it would take but little effort on your part to induce even a warmer sentiment her father thinks you one of the angels that came down to earth and forgot to return to heaven she ought not to go through life alone her only trouble is the suspicion that rests on her name a suspicion she considers herself bound in honor to do nothing to lift show her that you know how innocent she is and you will bring a new light to her eyes a new smile to her lips but asked catching at the straw how can i tell her how can i explain the source of my information laughed by the novel method of using the truth or at least a part of it he said tell her you were out riding and saw and followed him you needn t count me into it why you ve got to let her know or else i have it s a thing she would almost give her life to have revealed without her aid go like a man and take that heavy weight off her young soul finally consented he would not discuss the question of whether he would afterwards speak of the hope that lay nearest his heart but he would go to her as suggested and relieve her of the strain that had worn so deeply he would go the very next day the it was accomplished the better the more he thought of it the more de a black lighted he grew that he could carry such tidings he could make happier that was enough for him at present if he could make himself happy at a future date but there was time enough for that he sat upright in his saddle and as his horse bounded over the ground why was it not already day that he might turn the beast in the opposite direction the hours would be very long before the sun rose and he could start on his joyful errand the sombre hue of his countenance disappeared before the contentment that began to fill his breast he slept well notwithstanding the fact that he expected to lie awake all night when he retired in the morning on going down to breakfast he found that had left still earlier leaving word that he had started on a quest for game did not mind he had enough before him for one day he was going to see and he had that to tell which would the load she had so long felt compelled to carry he waited until after nine o clock feeling that some regard must be paid to les even on such an important occasion as this when he was in the saddle he rode as slowly as he could bring himself to do to make his arrival still later at last he reached the gate of and when he had summoned the porter he sent him for mr stating that he had happened to ride in that direction and wanted merely to make a short call it was but a few minutes before the servant re absolutely turned and the hospitable master of the premises came with him mr for using so much ceremony remarking that although he was living in a retired way there was always one friend he was glad to see giving up the horse accompanied his host to the house where the latter said he would send at once for a minute i want a little talk with you first alone mr looked up curiously he believed he knew what his visitor was about to say he had long suspected the feelings which entertained for he knew also that his daughter would consent to wed no man no matter who while there hung over her fair fame the terrible mystery of her wedding night i want to tell you pursued before his host could interrupt that i have made a great discovery one of the utmost moment to your family i know what happened on that day so sad to all of us and listen to me mr i know that your child is absolutely in the matter the listener s face grew very white he understood imperfectly but it seemed to him that a tale he could not bear to hear was about to be forced upon him mr he said earnestly i hope you will not continue this subject i do not know what occurred i do not wish to know i have consulted my daughter s sentiments entirely she prefers to have the veil and i respect her wish a black the visitor could hardly contain himself for impatience that has been true hitherto he replied but miss herself will be more than delighted when she knows i am aware of the entire facts which she has been prevented by a promise extracted from her from revealing call her let me tell her that i know everything and how i know it and you will fee the happiest girl in america mr shook his head doubtfully he was much afraid of doing something to injure s feelings he could not believe she wanted to have ihe trouble that had crushed her up by any one persisted however and his arguments it last won the day you do not think i would come here with any tidings i did not believe agreeable he said you know i care too much for for both of you to do that when miss was summoned which she was at last and mr

side i had seen the merchant ship fight with the it was so loud now that it seemed to me that the battle must be going on just beyond the nearest wood but my friend the knew better it s twelve to fifteen miles off said he you may be sure that the general knows that we are not wanted or we should not be resting here at what he said proved to be true for a minute later down came the colonel with orders that we should arms and where we were and there we stayed all day while horse and foot and guns english dutch and were streaming through the devil s music went on till evening sometimes rising into a roar sometimes the gathering of the nations sinking into a until about eight o clock in the evening it stopped altogether we were eating our hearts out as you may think to know what it all meant but we knew that what the duke did would be for the best so we just waited in patience next day the remained at in the morning but about mid day came an orderly firom the duke and we pushed on once more until we came to a little village called something and there we stopped and time too for a sudden thunder storm came on and a plump of rain that turned all the roads and the fields into and mire we got into the at this village for shelter and there we found two one fix m man who had a tale to tell that was as dreary as the weather had the the day before and our fellows had been sore put to it to hold their own against but had beaten him off at last it seems an old stale story to you now but you cannot think how we scrambled round those two men in the bam and pushed and fought just to catch a word of what they said and how those who had heard were in turn by those who had not we laughed and cheered and groaned all in turn as we were told how the forty fourth had received cavalry in line how the dutch had fled and how the black watch had taken the into their square and then had killed the great shadow them at their leisure but the had had the laugh on their side when they up the sixty ninth and carried off one of the colours to wind it all up the duke was in retreat in order to keep in touch with the and it was that he would take up his ground and fight a big battle just at the very place where we had been halted and soon we saw that this rumour was true for the weather cleared towards evening and we were all out on the ridge to see what we could see it was such a stretch of com and land with the crops just half green and half yellow and fine as high as a man s shoulder a scene more full of peace you could not think of and look where you would over the low corn covered hills you could see the little village up their among the but right across this pretty picture was a long trail of marching men some red some green some blue some black over the plain and choking the roads one end so close that we could shout to them as they their on the ridge at our left and the other end lost among the woods as far as we could see and then on other roads we saw the of horses toiling and the dull gleam of the guns and the men straining and swaying as they helped to turn the in the deep deep mud as we stood there regiment after regiment and after took position on the ridge and ere the sun had set we lay in a line lu ill m mm m g ss ba mm the gathering of the nations of over sixty thousand men napoleon s way to but the rain had come down again and we of the seventy first rushed off to our bam once more where we had better quarters than the greater part of our comrades who lay stretched in the mud with the storm beating upon them until the first peep of day chapter the shadow on the land it was still in the morning with brown drifting clouds and a damp chilly wind it was a queer thing for me as i opened my eyes to think that i should be in a battle that day though none of us ever thought it would be such a one as it proved to be we were up and ready however with the first and as we threw open the doors of our bam we heard the most lovely music that i had ever listened to playing somewhere in the distance we all stood in clusters to it it was so sweet and innocent and sad like but our laughed when he saw how it had pleased us all them are the french bands said he and if you come out here you ll see what some of you may not live to see again out we went  the beautiful music still sounding in our ears and stood on a rise just outside the bam down below at the bottom of the slope about half a shot firom us was a snug farm with a hedge and a bit of an apple orchard all round it a line of men in red coats and high fur hats were working like bees knocking holes in the wall and up the doors them s the light companies of the guards the shadow on the land said the they ll hold that farm while one of them can wag a finger	edith-wharton

to turn up that would call for it indeed it was always so with our family my grandfather had a and they never knew what was the matter with him till he died and he didn t himself it is wonderful how gifts and diseases can be concealed that way all that was necessary in my case was for this lovely and inspiring girl to cross my path and out came the poem and no more trouble to me to word it and rhyme it and perfect it than it is to stone a dog no i have said it was not in me but it was the boys couldn t say enough about it they were so charmed and astonished the thing that pleased them the most was the way it do the s business for him they forgot everything in their mark twain anxiety to get him and silenced was dear beside himself with admiration of the poem and wished he could do such a thing but it was out of his line and he couldn t of course he had it by heart in half an hour and there was never anything so pathetic and beautiful as the way he it for that was just his gift  that and he better than anybody in the world and he could take off la hire to the very life  or anybody else for that matter now i never could worth a and when i tried with this poem the boys wouldn t let me finish they would have nobody but no l so then as i wanted the poem to make the best ble impression on and the company i told he might do the never was anybody so delighted he hardly believe that i was in earnest but i was i said that to have them know that i was the author of it would be enough for me the boys were full of and said if he could just get one chance at those people it would be all he would ask he would make them realize that there was something higher and finer than war lies to be had here but how to get the  that was the difficulty we invented several schemes that promised fairly and at last we hit upon one that was sure that was to let the get a good start in a battle and then send in a false call for him and as soon as he was out of the room have take his place and finish the battle himself in the s own style to a shade recollections of of arc that would get great applause and win the house s favor and put it in the right mood to hear the poem the two together would finish the standard bearer  him anyway to a certainty and give the rest of us a chance for the future so the next night i kept out of the way the had got his start and was sweeping down upon the enemy like a at the head of his corps then i stepped within the door in my official uniform and announced that a messenger from general la hire s quarters desired speech with the standard bearer he left the room and took his place and said that the interruption was to be but that fortunately he was personally acquainted with the details of the battle himself and if i would be glad to state them to the company then without waiting for the i he turned himself into the  a of course  with manner tones gestures attitudes everything exact and went right on with the battle and it would be impossible to imagine a more perfectly and ridiculous imitation than he furnished to those shrieking people they went into of laughter and the tears flowed down their cheeks in the more they laughed the more inspired grew with his theme and the greater the he worked till really the laughter was not properly laughing any more but screaming feature of all was d with and presently there was little left of her but and victory it was a i mark twain the was gone only a couple of minutes he found out at once that a trick had been played on him so he came back when he approached the door he heard in there and recognized the state of the case so he remained near the door but out of sight and heard the performance through to the end the applause got when he finished was wonderful and they kept it up kept it up clapping their hands like mad and shouting to him to do it over again but was clever he knew the very best for a poem of deep and refined sentiment and pathetic melancholy was one where great and merriment had prepared the spirit for the powerful contrast so he paused until all was quiet then his face grew grave and assumed an impressive aspect and at once all faces in sympathy and took on a look of wondering and expectant interest now he began in a low but distinct voice the opening verses of the rose as he breathed the measures forth and one gracious line after another fell upon those enchanted ears in that deep hush one could catch on ev y hand half audible of how lovely  how beautiful  how exquisite by this time the who had gone away for a moment with the opening of the poem was back again and had stepped within the door he stood there now resting his great frame against the wall and gazing toward the like one when got to the second part and that refrain began to melt and move all listen recollections op op arc ers the began to wipe away tears with the back of first one hand and then the other the next time	helen-mathers

pleasant day for the hills shut out the hot sun i only rode twenty two miles for the difficulty of riding on ice was great and there is no blacksmith within thirty five miles of hall s i met two just after i left who gave me the unwelcome news that there were thirty miles of ice between that and you ll have a tough trip they said the road runs up and down hill walled in along with a rushing river by high mountains the scenery is very grand but i hate being shut into these deep and always expect to see some startling object moving among the trees i met no one the whole public opinion approved this execution regarding it as t for a series of crimes xii the rocky mountains day after passing the except two men with a pack jack hates and and as soon as she sees one it was a bad road one sheet of ice and awfully lonely and between the peril of the mare breaking her leg on the ice and that of being crushed by of timber i had to look out all day towards sunset i came to a cabin where they keep travellers but the woman looked so faced that i preferred to ride four miles farther up a beautiful road winding along a sunny filled with silver and more silvery than any i have yet seen and then crossed a divide from which the view in all the ecstasy of sunset colour was perfectly glorious it was enjoyment also in itself to get out of the deep chasm in which i had been all day there is a train of twelve freight here each with six horses but the carry their own blankets and sleep either in their or on the floor so tho house is not crowded it is a pleasant two log house not only but lined with timber each room has a great open chimney with logs burning in it there are pretty on the walls and baskets full of hanging from the ceiling this is the first s house i have been in in which the ornamental has had any place there is a door to each room the oak chairs are bright with rubbing and the floor though a lady s life in letter xii is so clean that one might eat off it the table is clean and abundant and the mother and daughters though they do all the work look as trim as if they did none and actually laugh heartily the neither allows drink to be brought into the house nor to be drunk outside and on this condition only he keeps travellers the come in to supper quite well washed and though twelve of them slept in the kitchen by nine o clock there was not a sound this business is most profitable i think that the charge is three cents per pound from to south park and there much of the freight is transferred to pack and carried up to the mines a railroad however is contemplated i with the family after the freight train left and instead of sitting down to up the remains of a meal they had a fresh and hot food the are all polished oak with polished brass bands the

little rest or refreshment now across plains now struggling through rivers and panting up steep banks now forcing their way through and now concealing themselves behind rocks or in gravel from some band of sometimes passing ruined castles burnt and deserted villages sometimes keeping aloof from robbers towers and then again obtaining entrance in the king s name to some walled town and refreshing themselves at some inn where the came curiously about them and learnt their errand and wished them success whether de had prepared the nobly won way for by spreading the news of her mission on his way

others and de as he rode boldly and proudly at her side quite forgot those suspicions which had lately made him ready to drop her into a gravel pit in fact he now really liked her very much in an honest kind of way for he could not but be won by her piety her modesty her her courage and her silent endurance of many and daily hardships as for her mission he left that to take care of itself it was quite out of his line to say whether she were or were not inspired the king must look to that all he had undertaken was to lead her to the king a noble purpose the king himself was at this time in

the other hand she might be an useful instrument and revive the fainting courage of his people after some consideration he desired that she should come to the town of and there await his orders meanwhile was as de remarked making up for lost time by hearing three masses a day in the church of st at and passing nearly her whole time within its walls there an old priest showed her a curious old sword marked with five crosses which much pleased her and she said that if she were so happy as to find grace in the sight of the king she would ask him to give it her after a little suspense de a noble purpose returned and said she was to go forward she asked where she was to lodge and was told at an inn she then begged very earnestly to know whether there was any respectable women with whom she could lodge saying it was her mother s particular desire de replied that a very respectable woman named would provide for her near the castle with which she was well satisfied meanwhile it was warmly in council whether charles should see her or not the duke d on t and other great leaders all had their several opinions that of the king s favourite the de la was not without its weight some

a while used to tell her he was unhappy and she used to reply she was of it then he began to speak of his wife and say what a fool he had been to marry a poor silly when he might have wedded a beauty mary wells being intensely vain listened with complacency to this although she replied coldly and harshly by and by her natural over malice and that shrewd insight into human nature which many a low woman has  the cooler she was the warmer did richard grow till at last ms pale meek wife with this glowing he conceived an liking for the latter she met it sometimes with coldness and reproaches sometimes with affected alarm sometimes with a half yielding manner and bo tormented him to her s content and his affection for his wife thus she herself on them both to her heart s content but malice so perverse is apt to on and women in particular should not undertake a long and subtle revenge of this sort since the strongest have their hours v of weakness and are surprised into things they never intended the subsequent history of mary wells will this meantime however meek little mrs was no match for the beauty and low cunning of her rival yet a time came when she defended herself unconsciously she did something that made her husband most for her welfare and happiness he began to watch her health with maternal care to shield her from draughts to take care of her diet to indulge her in all her instead of her and to pet her till was the happiest wife in for a time she deserved this at his for she as him there where his heart was fixed she aided his did more for it than any other creature in england could to return to hall the loving couple that owned it were no longer happy the hope of offspring was now them and the disappointment was cruel they suffered deeply with this difference that lady and sir charles the woman s grief was more pure and profound than the man s if there had been no richard in the world still her bosom would have and and the great cry of nature give me children or i die would have been in her heart though it would never have risen to her lips sir charles had of course less of this profound instinct than his wife but he had it too only in him the feeling was and at the same time by a terrible temptation this the man and gradually a temper habitually sweet h subject as we have seen to violent where the provocation was intolerable sir charles then under his wound spoke now and then rather to the wife he loved so that is to say his manner sometimes implied that he blamed her for then joint calamity lady submitted to these in silence they were rare and speedily followed by touching regrets and even had it not been so she would have borne them with resignation for this wife loved her husband with all a wife s devotion and a mother s unselfish patience let this be remembered to her credit it is the truth and she may need it her own yearning was too deep and sad for yet though unlike her husband s it never broke out in anger the day was gone by when she could keep it always silent it out of her at times in ways that were truly womanly and r f a faint cry had been heard at the bottom of the old well  it was ninety feet deep people had assembled and a brave farmer s boy had been lowered in the of a and had brought up a dead hen and a live child bleeding at the cheek having fallen on a heap of at the bottom of the well which child was the prisoner s sir charles had the evidence written down and then told the accused she might make a counter statement if she chose but it would be wiser to say nothing at all thereupon the accused dropped him a little short courtesy looked him steadily in the face with her pale gray eyes and delivered herself as follows  if you please sir i was a sitting by th old well with baby in my arms and i was mortal tired i was wi of him he be uncommon heavy for his age and if you please sir he is uncommon resolute and whilst i was so he give a leap right out of my arms and fell down th old well i screams and runs away to tell my brother s f il  a temptation went out but soon returned looking pale and wild yes said she with forced calmness then suddenly losing her self command she broke out pointing through the window at he has got a fine boy  to take our place here kill me charles i send me to heaven to pray for you and take another wife that will love you less but be like other wives that villain has married a vine and both arms to heaven with a gesture piteous poetic and touching i am a stock chapter the of all the fools nature produces with the help of society fathers of first are about the most offensive the mothers of are too flinging their human at every head but considering the they have suffered and the anguish the little they have just will most likely give them and considering further that their love of their first bom is greater than their pride and their pride by vanity one must make for them but the male parent is not so his vanity is an

mind that there had been some very singular points about this run i  its length and its and the fact that from the first find no one ever caught a glimpse of the creature some silly talk which had i going round the country about the king of the  a sort of demon fox so that it could an pack and so fierce that could do i nothing with it if they overtook it  came j back into his mind and it did not seem so now in the dim fir wood as it had done when the story had been told over the wine and the which had been on him in the morning and which he had hoped that he had shaken off swept over him again in an overpowering wave he had been so proud of being alone and yet he would have ten pounds now to have had joe s homely ce beside him and then just at that moment there broke out from the part of the wood the most that ever he had heard in his li the hounds had run into their fox well u know or you ought to know what your duty is in such a case you have to be whip and everything else if you are the man up you get in among the hounds lash them off and keep tbe brush and from being destroyed of course knew all about tha and he tried to force his mare the the king of the to the place where all this hideous and howling came om but the wood was so thi  that it was impossible to ride it he sprang off therefore left the mare standing and broke his way through as best he could with his hunting lash ready over his shoulder but as he ran forward he felt his flesh go cold and all over he had heard hounds run into many times before but he had never heard such sounds as these they were not the cries of triumph but of fear every now and then came a shrill of mortal holding his breath he ran on until he broke the branches and found himself in a little clearing with the hounds all crowding round a patch of tangled at the further end when he first caught sight of them the hounds were standing in a round this with their backs and their jaws in front of the lay one of than with his throat torn out all crimson and white came running out into the clearing and at the sight of him the hounds took heart again and one of them sprang with a growl into the bushes at the same instant a creature the size of a donkey jumped on to its feet a huge grey head with monstrous glistening and fox jaws shot out om among the branches and the hound was thrown several feet into the air and fell howling among the cover then there was a snap uke a rat trap closing and the sharpened into a scream and then were still had been on the look out for symptoms all day and now he had found them he looked more at the thicket saw a of the king of the age red eyes fixed upon him and took to his heels it might be a passing delusion m it might be the permanent of which the doctor had spoken but anyhow the thing to do was to get back to bed and to quiet and to hope for tiie best he forgot the hounds the hunt and every thing else in his desperate fears for his own reason he sprang upon his mare galloped her madly over the downs and only stopped when he found himself at a country station there he left his mare at the inn and made back for home as quickly as steam would take him it was evening he got there shivering with apprehension and seeing those red eyes and teeth at every turn he went straight to bed and sent for dr i ve got em doctor said he it came about exactly as you said  strange creatures and everything all i ask you now is to save my reason the doctor listened to his story and was shocked as he heard it it appears to be a very clear case said he this must be a lesson to you for life never a drop again if i only come safely through this well my dear boy if you will stick to that it may prove a blessing in disguise but the difficulty m this case is to know where ct ends and fancy begins you see it is not as if there was only one delusion there have been several the dead dogs for example must have one as well as the creature in the bush i saw it all as clearly as i see you one of the of this form of delirium is that what you see is even than the king of the reality i was wondering the whole run was not a delusion also pointed to his hunting boots still lying upon the floor with the of two hum that looks very real certainly no doubt in your weak state you over exerted self and so brought this attack upon yourself well whatever the cause our treatment is clear you wiu take the soothing mixture which i will send to you and we shall put two upon your temples to night to relieve any of the brain so spent the night in tossing about and reflecting what a sensitive thing this machinery of ours is and how very foolish it is to play tricks with what is so easily put out of gear and so to mend and so lie repeated and repeated his oath that this first lesson should be his last and	edith-wharton

only he paused and looked more darkly than ever at his attendant if it should happen to be a and it was cooked more than one minute on each side on a over coals i would not touch it if it hiss is shocked was in a spider as i have known your countrymen to cook it i would sue the landlord of this house for assault and battery and i would get judgment too if there is coffee and i don t say there will be it must come up here half cream and very hot or it will go down again if there are potatoes they will have to be brown but not burned mind you and if anyone should offer me v not merely to night but at any time during my stay there would be blood you may go miss delivered this message of its to the cook and then went to the rear door of the kitchen for air she was actually dizzy from the shock to her feelings at her strange reception as soon as she was out of the room young threw himself into one of the easy chairs the only articles of furniture present of which he fully approved and laughed he muttered talk about your your it takes a free born american to bow before the power of gold as long as i have plenty of money to over the wounds to their sentiments i can wipe my feet on any of them there is not a de in europe who would endure half the insolence i gave that woman i shall be ashamed of my country if does not come up here and toss me out of the window the cook who had heard all that william and could tell her of what had passed upstairs was in a nervous state lest the she was preparing should be returned as unsatisfactory but had exhausted for the moment his love of lots at fun and ate his supper which was really very good without comment when it was finished he walked the to watch the stars which shone brightly over the still mountain and valley and in the pleasure of the contemplation forgot his loneliness foi the time his uncle was away on business when he arrived at but returned within a day or two and came promptly to the hotel noticed as he had in the interview at new york that there was something for which he could not account in the manner of this relation he felt that he had in some unknown way displeased him and expected every time mr opened his mouth to learn the cause of his changed attitude he feared that he had delayed too long to suit his uncle s ideas in deciding what to adopt as a profession but he had become so used to doing nothing that he did not like the thought of giving it up though the conversation lasted for more than an hour however it bore no reference to this subject it ran backward and forward at random among things native and foreign and not a word was spoken conveying the least hint that anything disagreeable was in mind could not help wondering whether he had alarmed himself could it be that his busy uncle was willing he should lead a life of entire idleness i hope they make things agreeable for you here said mr after one of his long pauses quite so responded having miss is shocked in countries where the manners are so entirely different things seem a little odd at first but is doing the best he can the elder man seemed relieved at the answer i live so plainly myself said he that i fear you would not be comfortable at my house however some day before you go if you would like to come for a dinner i i could arrange it that is of course with time for preparation laughed lightly that sounds awfully formal said he i would be glad to take pot luck with you but the hotel is just as well when you get a chance you might come in and dine with me and save all the trouble i will do that then responded the other drawing a long breath on the whole it would be better yes he added it would be much better although mr had dined twice with his nephew after this he had said nothing in relation to the dreaded subject up to the time when he sent the pretty to call him as detailed in the first chapter of this story lots at seventy chapter vi i m sure i can trust you mr had nothing of special moment to communicate to his nephew beyond the message in the words of miss a matter connected with his business had suddenly occurred which made it necessary for him to take a journey that might occupy a fortnight or more he only wished to say good by to and to inquire whether he would probably find him at on his return had this question been asked an hour sooner at any time in fact before he met the charming girl the young man would have answered without hesitation that he would spend the time of his uncle s absence by taking a trip to new york he cordially disliked and remained merely from motives of policy nothing but his interest in the face he had just seen would have kept him there over night but to such a man this reason was amply sufficient he had no idea of leaving a village containing such a worthy object of attention and he told mr	arthur-conan-doyle
people by whom they are surrounded identify themselves with their interests and have no other expectation but that of living and dying among them it must be admitted that the chinese contrast this life of with that of large numbers of living in comfortable and what seem to them wealthy homes in the treaty ports surrounded by as many of the of life as are usual in the homes in foreign and with wives children friends and society not very often as in the case of the at living in the native cities missionary among the chinese and going home with their families for a year or more once in five or seven years while admiring the self denial and devotion of the roman missionary priests i do not express any opinion as to rival methods and merits but only state facts which are forced upon every traveller and purpose to return to the subject of later it is usual for the of the china inland mission and for those of the mission of the c m s to live in chinese houses actually among the city a course which is considerably on grounds of health and safety chapter x the upper i was very impatient to be off on my western journey but after the boat was engaged the ropes examined by at the customs and my few stores  tea powder and rice  had been bought i had four days of hanging on the made various excuses for delay one day it was that the or master had not advanced them money wherewith to buy stores another was a feast day a third must be spent in paying debts or they would be detained and on the fourth they said they must visit certain temples and make for the success of the voyage the weather was raw grim and i had had a fire day and night in my room at the customs and a boat was a prospect but things usually turn out far better than either or expectations and this voyage was no exception i was fortunate in being able to take as far as wan mr of the china inland mission who had had ten years experience in accompanied by mr a new arrival and they engaged the boat for the next stage to which gave mr s some little hold on the pan who was a mean and person into evil ways by a terrible wife a whose loud tongue was rarely silent who had beaten her eldest boy to death a few months before and of whom the remaining boy  a child of eight  lived in piteous terror lest he should share the same fate this family of five lived in the high stern cabin but were apt to run over into parts of the boat which should have been the crew consisted of a pilot who is responsible for the a a cook and sixteen and the boat itself was a small house boat of about twenty tons flat with one tall mast and big sail a projecting the author s house boat and a sweep on the bow her passenger accommodation consisted of a cabin the width of the boat with a front opening on the bow deck where the sixteen rowed smoked ate and slept round a central well in which a industrious cook washed prepared food cooked it and it all day long using a fire at night and a mat roof were put up and the after enjoying their supper and their pipes at the stern rolled themselves in and slept till daybreak passengers usually furnish this cabin and put up curtains and photographs and eat and sit there but i had no and my furniture consisted only of a carrying chair in which it was very delightful to sit and watch the and surprises of the river but gradually the and the s family came to over run this cabin and i constantly found the with her unwelcome baby girl or a dirty half naked in my chair and the eight year old boy spent much of his time crouching in a corner out of reach of his mother s tongue and fist this were three small with windows glazed with paper and a passage down the port side from the stern to the bow on which i cannot say they opened for they were open and a partial privacy was only obtained by making a with a curtain these was the s place which was also a kitchen and den where my servant cooked and where the pilot and most of the crew were to be seen every night lying on the floor beside their lamps passing into felicity again at a greater height the and his family lived on the roof there were hen and great of rope for it was an old boat and the owner was not a man of substance the paper on the windows was torn away the window frame of the cabin in which i slept ate and carried on my various occupations had fallen out the cracks in the were half an inch

i ell mr what your decision asked as he was again ushered into the cabin have you concluded to accept the terms i have concluded not to accept them replied firmly looked disconcerted and angry it was some time before he spoke why so he i thought you had concluded to do so before we parted no sir you saw no objection to informing me where you obtained your information i see none now then the other point is the one to which you object it is you say you have no pretensions none mr but if ever i am miss by the yankee os again i want the right to caution her against one who would make her the victim of a heartless speculation undoubtedly this declaration was a very impudent one and if mr had not before made up his mind to hang his victim this would have been sufficient to induce him to carry out his barbarous threat did not believe that his in the face of public sentiment and the recognized laws of war would have the to such an crime it must be confessed in the light pf previous and subsequent revelations that he failed to understand and appreciate the spirit of the rebellion s stock of patience was exhausted and he could no longer express himself in the assumed tones of politeness which he had before labored to use he was angry and and the dark on his brow was a witness of the darker purpose which in his soul mr you beard the lion in his den i will waste no more words upon you replied he furiously and he sent the servants to summon certain officers whom he named i think it my duty to say exactly what i mean replied the officers who had been sent for presently appeared the number included and the captain of the steamer l of whom was competent to sit on a by the adventures of a officer court martial two naval officers apparently masters or completed the and the trial proceeded at once the charges were written out in due form and there was an appearance of used though the whole proceeding was simply a pretext to sacrifice the life of the prisoner fifteen minutes completed the business of the and after a consultation of fifteen minutes more was to be hung as a spy forthwith by this time the prisoner had come to a painful of the fact that his enemies were in earnest he was doomed to an death and the sentence was to be immediately executed he was taken to the main deck again by who acted as master over the a cord had been suspended from a deck beam above and a board placed over the on which the was to stand saw these preparations and the blood seemed to be frozen in his veins he felt that he was about to die  that he was on the threshold of eternity it was a solemn and awful thought though he had often contemplated the possibility and the probability on the eve of battle of passing away from the scenes of earth but now it was more real than ever before for there before him was the rope and there the drop from which he was to be ushered into the world beyond the grave are you all ready demanded by the yankee ob tf all ready sir replied the master at arms then bring forward your prisoner was conducted to the he was conscious that he was a living being  that his brain was still active but his body seemed to be detached from the thinking and feeling part of him everything looked misty and confused to him the rope said mechanically for he seemed to be hardly less moved than his victim the command was obeyed but even s hand trembled as he placed the knot under the ear of the prisoner everything contributed to assure that the were an earnest f that it was no farce in which they were engaged even his trembled which would not have been the case if he had been engaged in an attempt to deceive him there was no hope and breathed his silent prayer to god in that awful hour that his sins might be forgiven that the loved ones at home might be happy when he was gone and that his death might not be in vain but be an acceptable sacrifice to the holy cause to which he had devoted himself f his prayer gave him hope and strength his body and his brain seemed to be he looked his full in the face he was determined to die like a man and a christian and to permit his enemies to derive no strength from his weakness by the adventures of a naval officer  are you ready mr asked in tones so full of as to betray his terror to his companions i am replied calmly and gently as one who can almost see the glories of the invisible world have you nothing to say nothing no message to leave none that i can to you tou would it proceed said fiercely for the words of the victim roused anew the hatred which the solemn event had for the moment softened was led out upon the board over the which was so placed that it could be easily slipped and thus the prisoner into the hold if you ever say prayers say them now for you have but a moment left said in tones prayed as he had never prayed before for god was nearer to him and he was speaking in the presence of the infinite again i ask you mr if you have anything to say or any message to leave if you can speak without insulting me i assure you your last request shall be fulfilled said again by the awful circumstances of the	isabella-lucy-bird
the house for the moment was not herself but the wild queen raging in the the yellow of the wine god all london came to see the frantic over which presided and night after night the little music hall was filled to overflowing made good use of her fame she insisted that her salary should be raised took modest lodgings in and for a time saved her money as a provision against old age and poverty on the stage she was a dancing demon but at home no one could have been more modest there was not a breath of scandal against her in spite of mrs ward s hint to this change in the formerly reckless woman was caused by love and gratitude to george he had saved her from starvation from death he had procured her the engagement which had led to her success and present ease and speaking she cast herself and all she had at his feet found this excessive gratitude rather trying even then he was in love with whom he had met twice or thrice and he was not disposed to accept the wild passion which so freely offered to him he tried to make her see reason to look upon him as a friend and not as a lover but in her insane way she resolutely refused to regard him as other than the man she intended to marry ti spite of her and her wild career had never and so far could well have made her his wife but he did not love her and hardly the idea of taking this wild creature to his heart and home could not understand this coldness she was accustomed to see men at her feet and to them now that she was to surrender her liberty and to give her love it exasperated her to think that the one man she had chosen would have none of her as yet she knew nothing of s love for but with the instinct of a jealous k a woman guessed that some such passion engrossed the mind of the man she desired to marry again and again she george with questions which he always refused to answer so she could learn nothing wearied of her stopped away and for a few weeks did not see him she followed him to his rooms but found him absent then she saw his name in the papers connected with the square tragedy and wrote to him he accepted her invitation and came to supper less because of her desire than because he wished to speak to her about the name of on the lips of the red man had startled almost as much as the fact that appeared to be acquainted with him george could not recall meeting the man and as he was not yet sufficiently famous for his name to be on the lips of the public he wondered how it came about that knew of his existence anxious to know who the man was he sent a note marked private to miss bull and received a reply stating that mr was a new and so far as she knew a gentleman who lived on his income but this did not satisfy as it did not account for s knowledge there remained to question and to george went a night or two after the rescue of the red man made up his mind and a strong mind it was that he would not leave until he knew positively how her name came to be mentioned by at eleven o clock was anxiously awaiting his arrival and when he entered her little she flew to kiss his hand her usual extravagant form of greeting george like all englishmen hated scenes and these was always making li vain had he tried to break her of these tendencies her hot southern blood q the yellow not cool and she overwhelmed him with of more than friendship of these he took no notice and as it takes two to make love as well as to make a quarrel was yet far from gaining her heart s desire this was a formal offer of marriage having just returned from the music hall wore a loose tea gown of scarlet trimmed with glittering jet it was a garment but the vivid color suited her dark face and southern looks she was rather tall very slender and she moved with the dangerous grace of a her face was oval sallow and thin with ever changing expressions she was never two minutes the same but her mood was one of fierce intensity the fire in her great black eyes blazed into passionate love as she swept forward to greet her visitor my my adored she cried in good english and kissed his hand with burning lips george snatched it away don t you know i hate that sort of thing and so saying he threw down his coat and hat on the sofa at the far end of the room shrugged her shoulders and up a of her black hair which had come loose putting it in its place she glanced into the mirror over the fireplace to see that her comb was at the right angle she wore a diamond comb in the spanish fashion so fond was she of jewels that george sometimes fancied she must have blood in her veins all her went in jewels  diamonds for choice they are pretty would say when remonstrated with her and when i am poor they can be changed into money oh yes why not a ah but you are a cold blood you english man

sweet children the chance of their lives to profess fright which it was easy to see was and give utterance to screams mrs young had some sharp words with the driver for the way he abused his beasts

feet tucked under them eating rice and fish with which they handle as well as we would a knife and fork each guest has a girl servant looking like a pretty doll who in front of him and to every want

matter and found that he had brought away mrs s case by mistake probably he had laid his own case on the small table alongside hers  and in fact he remembered doing so  and when departing had unconsciously taken the one which did not belong to him he resolved to return it at once by post but meanwhile took a the sealed message to smoke since there were no others in his rooms this opening the case and when it was open a small object which had been placed within fell out this proved to be a tiny coral hand clenched and holding a dagger something like those which are sold in to the evil eye a little gold ring was into the coral so that the could be attached to a watch chain or to a after a careless glance and a passing thought as to why mrs should use her case as a jewel box placed the coral hand on top of the which he laid on the then he lighted up and walked out to seek the major s rooms these as has been said were only a few doors distant and speedily arrived on the first floor of the somewhat dingy house wherein they were situated he found the door open and a mild looking talking to a veiled woman with a graceful figure while waiting to address the man himself heard him state to the lady that his master had gone to on the previous day and would be back within four and twenty hours the lady appeared annoyed but declined to leave a card or to give any message however she stepped aside  as guessed from the way in which she stamped her foot and clenched her hands  and permitted him to speak asked the same question as to the major s whereabouts and received the same answer upon which he produced his card tell major when he returns that mr wishes to see him on a private matter mr added the young man handing the card then he turned away wondering why the veiled woman should utter a muffled exclamation of surprise when she heard the christian name the sealed message but his wonder was still further increased when on descending the stairs he felt his arm grasped and found that the strange lady was at his elbow you are mr she said in deep tones may i call you  prince started it was in this way that addressed him but this woman could not be for she was too thin and too tall and her voice was too worn could she be he said assented the woman softly  they were standing on the pavement by this time take me somewhere safe i wish to speak with you my rooms are close at hand said promptly and wondering at this unexpected encounter with one whom he had believed to be miles away we can go there at once bell hush she clutched his arm again and looked over her shoulder as she had looked when in the don t say that name here they may hear  they may hear who may hear never mind never mind come inside come inside oh no mention of my name and she hurried into the doorway indicated by in a few minutes they were in sitting room and here again s betrayed itself there is no one can hear us she asked her veil up and her eyes round the room no no replied the young man soothingly the man and his wife who attend to me in these chambers are below you can talk freely by the way he asked abruptly how did you know my name looking more aged and haggard than ever flung herself into an and laughed the sealed message prince who calls you prince mr does but then it is true what she confessed to me that you love her and she loves you quite true rejoined quickly we met by chance and by chance repeated scornfully when you deliberately came where you had no business to come i know all how did you find out was perfectly calm when he asked this question as she did not seem to be hostile i saw that was not herself that she was disturbed and guessed that she was keeping something secret from me i watched and saw her lead a man across the when she came in that night i told her what i had seen and she confessed about the sealed message and about her secret meetings with you also that you desired to marry her fool cried pointing a scornful finger at her host would you marry a not in making my wife said coolly she is perfectly sane and i   say that she is not are you sane yourself asked turning the tables on her the woman reared herself in her chair the arms and directed a fierce gaze at him what do you mean she demanded why did you not come out and face me when talked with me in the garden he remarked meeting her gaze firmly and fairly because  because oh there is no explanation the sealed message i think there is you dare not venture out after dark so you waited until entered the house to question her how do you know that i dare not venture out after dark she asked and her figure seemed to and shrink told knows nothing nothing do you hear god forbid that she should ever know anything but business is my own business and

what is called an on board ship this term is applied to officers and others who are not in either of the watches being what is called day officers the captain and officer who occupy the most positions on board are by this queer the principal mr was on duty on the berth deck during the day hence he was an which will account for his being in the mess room with during some of the long conversations we have had occasion to report mr could obtain no satisfaction below so he went on deck to nurse the of his discontent leaving to sleep out his watch below the wind continued to blow very fresh all night and by yankee or the captain was happily relieved from all and fear on that account although we are not permitted to the of the captain s cabin we will venture to say that he did not sleep much during that anxious night at six bells he was up and dressed engaged in certain reports which had been made to him in regard to the position of the vessel when he had carefully examined the sailing master s figures he went on deck it was seven bells in the mid watch or half past three in the morning when he took his place by the side of the officer of the deck sail ho shouted the man who had been stationed on the fore yard as a special sail ho repeated mr where away demanded the officer of the deck on the lee bow showing a green light and a white that s a steamer i exclaimed the captain when the report reached him all belonging to the united states as well as english french dutch and russian steam vessels carry in the night a bright white light at the head a green light on the side and a red light on the port side this is done in order to prevent at sea but it also those in charge of other vessels to tell which way the steamer fe going suppose the reader by ic  the adventures of a naval is standing on the of the and sees a red and a green light with a white one between them then the steamer is approaching you the white light which is placed higher on the vessel than the colored ones should be seen in a clear night at the distance of five miles it is the warning light the red and green lights being lower down can be seen only two or three miles k the sees the white light he watches till the others or one of them can be seen if the were headed to the east and a red light only were reported her commander would know that the steamer was coming up from the southward for then she would show her port side if the green light were seen it would prove that she was coming from the north if any of our young readers wish to remember this explanation so that they may test it when they go to sea they have only to call to mind the fact that port wine is red  port is the side and red the color if they cannot remember the color on the other side they have only to think how green they are in a knowledge of night the green light seen over the port bow assured captain that the steamer was coming from the north and that her course was at right angles with that of the he had no doubt that the steamer was the and his hopes ran high the circumstances could hardly have been more favorable for the by ic ob wind was fresh enough to make the if not quite a match for the in point of speed but the captain did not care to reduce the question to a mere matter of speed so he ordered the signal quarter master to bum blue lights on the quarter of the the steamer replied by burning another blue light and her identity was fully established mr had precisely carried out his part of the arrangement but it soon appeared from the movements of the snow den that he had no intention of being at present by his fellow instead of bearing down for the he held his course to the southward occasionally burning a blue light to assure the that she was aware of her presence captain was perplexed at first but he finally interpreted the movement to mean that he must wait for daylight before he her in confirmation of this supposition it was found that the had reduced her speed one half

medium by which new varieties of were introduced to an ungrateful world but such was his nature that given the companionship of and a cigar he could be absolutely counted on not to murmur this disposition to accept the trials and which came upon him without a passionate outburst was not by any means due to was of too strong a character to be continually amiable he merely exercised his philosophy in meeting trouble he boiled within but presented a calm front to the world simply because to do otherwise would involve an expenditure of nervous force which he did not consider to be worth while of an organ i can never forget the sense of admiring regard which i experienced when in while he and i were about to enter our banker s together he slipped upon a bit of his knee and destroying his leg i should have indulged in profane allusions to the person who had thrown the upon the ground if by some the accident had happened to me however did nothing of the sort but treated me to a forcible abstract consideration of the habits of the masses the unknown individual who was responsible for the accident did not enter into the question no one was consigned to everlasting torture in the deepest depths of a calm of an abstraction was all that greeted my ears the practice of was condemned as a thing entirely apart from the and as a tendency inwardly i know he swore outwardly he was as serene as though nothing had happened to him it was then that i came to admire before that he had my affectionate regard of an organ in fullest measure but now admiration for his deeper qualities set in and it has in no sense diminished as time has passed once and once only have i known him to depart from his philosophical and that one departure was i think justified by the situation since it was the point of a series of to fail to yield to which would have required a than human strength the incident to which i refer was in connection with a fine organ which a large expense had had built in his house for like all philosophers has a great fondness for music and is himself a of no mean capacity i have known him to sit down under a parlor lamp and read over the score of the just as easily as you or i would one of the lighter novels of the day this was one of his when his spirit was subjected to an extreme he relieved his soul by flying to the to use his own very bad joke when he was in need of composure he sought out the as time however and the petty grew more numerous the merely intellectual of an organ of the writings of and and possibly failed to suffice and an organ was contracted for i enjoy reading the music said he as we sat and talked over his plan but sometimes  very often in fact  i feel as if something ought to shriek and vm going to have an organ of my own to do it for me so as i have said the organ was contracted for was built and ah additional series of trials began upon a very important occasion the organ declined to shriek although every effort to persuade it to perform the functions for which it was designed was made forty or fifty very charming people were gathered together to be introduced to the virtues of the new instrument  for was not the kind of man to keep to himself the good things which came into his life he shared all his blessings while keeping his woes to himself a well known was retained to set forth the possibilities of the acquisition and all was going as merry as a marriage bell when suddenly there came a and the fingers of the well known were b of an organ powerless to the harmonious shrieks which all had come to hear it was a sad moment but was equal to the occasion something s out of gear he said with a laugh due rather to his philosophical nature than to mirth i m afraid we ll have to finish on the piano and so we did and a delightful evening we had of it although many of us went home wondering what on earth was the matter with the organ a few days later i met on the train and the mystery was solved the trouble was with the he explained they were put in wrong and the of the house is such that every time colonel on the other side of the street takes a bath all the water that

turns for the long craft proved equal to its passage in the of the whose art was little less than he found plenty of room where none was visible not even the walls with either end of his boat and all without the least apparent effort if anything was needed to make the young american certain he had passed from earth to the magic perfection of these difficult passages under numerous little arched bridges he floated and when at last he emerged upon the grand canal he uttered the word he had heard and was immediately rowed again into a succession of the minor ones finally the march of the early

her days and her father had no reason to expect that she would it must be a long time before she could the memory of what she had passed through besides she was now a wife and would soon be a mother the change in her manner was not more than he felt the facts should lead him to anticipate the life of the was singularly regular one day was very nearly like another rose earliest and generally took a short walk before breakfast on returning he found in their mutual sitting room and ordered the coffee and rolls to be sent up across the table a few words were exchanged referring to the weather to something in the newspaper or to slight matters connected with the life at after the first week they were at their ease during these while no demonstration of affection was thought of by either there was nothing like coldness friends who did not mean to get too intimate this they were and no more they kept out of each other s way and yet took good care that they should not seem to do so during the morning they met mrs new love gone and the colonel for an hour or so in the rooms occupied by the latter on account of the invalid character of the mother here and mrs talked about the thousand little things that interest women while her father and discussed such events as concern the business and political world the noon as well as the dinner was usually taken in common also in the colonel s apartments on account of the state of his wife s health in the afternoon the men went frequently together to the sometimes for a walk in the town at five o clock took his wife regularly to drive occasionally with her parents as companions but usually alone at a hour the separated for the night without with a simple word indicating that one or the other was about to retire the they occupied had but one entrance and not even the servants suspected how thoroughly their lives were lived apart chapter xvi the family secret the only break in the regularity of the winter came with a visit of mr who took a brief from the duties of his profession and made it the occasion for a little business with colonel as well as his the family secret acquaintance with mr gray the was entirely as far as knew though it appeared afterwards that the colonel had been expecting him for some time his presence did not bring much pleasure to the younger man who however endeavored to treat him with due politeness and succeeded fairly well it was distressing to sit at dinner as he was several times compelled to do with an who could the depth of his degradation and accuse him in his thoughts of what he would not for wealth have had revealed colonel seemed to have something of the kind in his own mind also and acted in a constrained manner during the it seemed to be the mission of mr to remind them both as well as the young lady herself that he had invented and carried out the plan under which everything was working so and that they ought to be thankful to him for it naturally they did not like this and the time when the must return to london was looked forward to without regret by both on the last day that dined with them mrs gray was and he expressed his regret in such warm terms that her husband felt a kind of personal the remarks were met in perfect silence by the gentlemen and it was left to mrs new to reply in her innocent courteous manner i am going to morrow morning on an early train said mr to gray when he happened to meet him alone later in the evening i have business at and shall not see you again so good bye love gone he put out his hand and as he knew no reason under the skies why he should not accept it mr gray did so coolly and silently the seemed surprised at such a leave taking and lingered instead of ascending the stairs to his room as he had made a movement to do you re all very comfortable i see he remarked with a motion of his head toward the other side of the hotel everything as as a cat in a rug never been sorry have you well i told you you wouldn t you ought to feel nicely toward me for putting you into such a pleasant position these expressions fearfully on the of the man to whom they were addressed and he grew white about the lips you seem to have forgotten what i once said to you he answered there are things about which i never talk and of which i try not even to think your part in them was ended long ago i ask you once more never to allude to them in my presence mr shrugged his shoulders and on the railing of the stairs by which he stood there must be things you would like to know he answered with a of revenge in his tone

get my trunks and get ready for dinner that is all for to day asked still feeling the duties assigned to be very strange ones that is all and to morrow will be very much like it smiled the the dinner is it to be at a private house no mr inquisitive at a public the day was certainly the most agreeable that had spent for months as he said to himself when he lay at last among his pillows he had dined with several friends of mr who had treated him with the courtesy due a foreigner and love astray stranger who comes with a good introduction after the dinner all had gone rather late to one of the theatres where devoted less attention to the play than to a family in one of the opposite boxes among whom was one of the most beautiful young girls he had ever seen wearing an appearance of reserve that amounted almost to sadness and which excited his utmost interest he noted that mr exchanged bows with an elderly lady in that party who seemed to be the young lady s mother but the appeared so well known that from the various boxes were the rule rather than the exception an unusually pretty girl that was all that mr said about her except to add and a of yours by the way chapter vi then there s a father too it was in the morning as the clock was striking nine that gray awoke he sprang out of bed with a he was his duties and then that there were none to perform he rang and requested the domestic to ask mr if mr had arrived or if any message had been received from him a negative reply was received and a light breakfast was served in his rooms somewhat to his surprise for nothing had been said then s a father too about that when he had eaten and dressed he strolled out of doors to his and returned about eleven o clock to find the busy at his desk how are you this morning was the question that greeted him quite well i am sure judging from your appearance i have a lot to do just now and shall have to beg you to excuse me at lunch but if you are here at four i shall be glad of your company for a drive nothing particular to say i suppose nothing said gray for was present and his character as a genuine friend of mr was at stake i should advise you to lunch at the to day continued mr with his eyes on the papers he was examining to morrow i will put you up at my club where things are much better you found the morning newspapers in your room i hope i told the man to have them for you when you awoke it was a strange kind of employment dining with a party of gentlemen being taken to the theatre given an elegant of rooms to live in and a drive in the park for the afternoon the manner of mr took away the feeling that might otherwise have the enjoyment of these things and strove to overcome his few remaining scruples at present he saw no reason to refuse the change of life he had been terribly tired of the narrow quarters he had occupied and the miserable meals he had been obliged to eat if it that the wished to be repaid for his kindness by the gone a of anything inconsistent with honor felt that he was fully able to meet the he could not however reconcile a fear of this sort with the correct and the position in society which his new friend gave evidence of possessing there was one matter that i forgot last evening said gray to the when were driving that afternoon and it did not occur to me till an hour ago you may remember that i had an appointment with my for the payment of two hundred so you had said mr with a laugh well all i can do is to credit it to your account it was clearly my fault that you were unable to be there to get your money oh no replied the young man earnestly if i remain in london i shall be almost sure to meet him again and the amount is not so vital to me as it was yesterday very well but if you meet him and he asks questions please don t say anything about our arrangements in fact if he is the kind of fellow he seems it would be best to avoid all unnecessary talk with him i am afraid he is a bad one you need have no fear said gray he is not a man i would care to have anything to do with the conversation was interrupted at this point by the sudden appearance at a turn in the road of a carriage in which were seated the young lady and her mother that had noticed at the theatre the preceding night as the passed closely to each other both gentlemen lifted their hats and then there s a father too received a very agreeable bow from the elder lady accompanied by a hardly perceptible one from her daughter a decidedly handsome young woman said mr rather cold however was mr gray s comment appearances are not always to be relied upon in such matters said his friend wisely i do not think that dignity from the merit of a young woman in this age of there seemed something in this observation which took as rather a rebuke and he the thrust by asking if mr knew the family well very well indeed was the reply they are americans of wealth and position the father is really quite

sea m came upon the deck where i was he looked surprised i thought annoyed and made no attempt to intrude himself upon me asked about him and that was the first time we learned his name he was it appeared a french gentleman of fortune who had travelled and now held a commission in the army at we lost him while we remained in that town and vicinity about a week he went directly to but the second day after we reached the latter place we saw him again it was at a review and he was with his regiment a expression crossed the face of the at this point and i listened intently for what was to follow he saw me and called my attention to him after that he appeared before me nearly every day in some way or other sometimes he dined at the hotel de with a group of officers one evening i recognized in his party a gentleman to whom a gentleman of france i had been introduced in france a relation of a lady whom i knew at home after dinner this gentleman spoke to me and as we were conversing m passed allow me to present my friend said the america n and the formality was achieved but knowing nothing of each other s languages this seemed of little moment i am sure i thought nothing of it and i should have left with only the faintest memory of m had he not sent me this letter the which she handed me was in french written in a bold hand and with unusually clear it was a plain straightforward proposal of marriage you will wonder said the letter at the extreme of a man who has only met you once in a formal way but i love you i have oo patience to wait till i can acquire the tongue you speak nor to take the slow and path that winds through the ordinary road to matrimony i a list of as to my standing and reputation i am a gentleman to whose family and fortunes you need not be ashamed to ally yourself as the expression may appear it is the first time i have ever cared for a woman take time for your answer if it is necessary but at least give me the opportunity to meet you again even should it be on terms of friendship alone i am not quoting the letter literally but its purport was to the effect i have stated this letter continued miss when i had finished reading it aroused my interest still more in the gentleman i had not the slightest idea of falling in love with him and my aversion to out of was too firmly fixed to enable me to give him the answer he desired but i had for me a kind note declining his offer and saying that i would be glad nevertheless to have him call on me at any time after this was written it occurred to me that a meeting at the hotel would attract attention i had the maid tear up that note and write another containing only the and a statement that i would try to see him at some time to be decided later it happened that while i was going to la to visit the a carriage containing m overtook mine the meeting was entirely accidental he saluted me in answer to my bow and when the horses were stopped for a rest he came and spoke to me by the wheel of my vehicle ah interpreted his remarks which were most courteous and respectful before we started again he requested permission to ride with myself and the and it was granted taking the seat he had in his carriage our conversation carried on through the was necessarily slow but i found him interesting and learned much of the country through which we were passing and of in general during the next few hours at the a brother took us in charge and we visited the points usually shown to travellers finishing with a light lunch then told me that i might see a ceremony in the if i chose to accompany the priest and m and i went with eagerness in the midst of this ceremony to which guided my consisting only of the word out there was a pause the ceased to speak to us and stepping into a gentleman of the called out something in a loud voice and m exchanged a dozen sentences all of course greek to me and then we hastened to our carriages and drove away all i could learn was that something had the and that it was best for us to leave at once the true cause i never dreamed of until you told me the conversation you had with i interrupted it now appears that a marriage service was being repeated and that the words i was were promises to love honor and obey for the rest of my life a man i had recently refused the ceremony would not have made me a wife in the eyes of the law without being by another from the civil authority but it is none the less startling to think i should have been drawn into anything of the kind suspecting nothing i returned to and parted with m just before entering the city i wanted to ask about s part in this affair but i thought it best to let her finish her story first a few days later continued arranging in a more comfortable position he having fallen asleep in her lap i went to m to my surprise joined us there he had been ordered to make a tour of some of the and his proposition to take our party with him was accepted with little hesitation affording such a fine opportunity to get at the inside of things in that	arthur-conan-doyle

which i could bring against the woman it would be worse than useless to attempt to warn my until i had definitely made up my mind what i was to warn him against he would treat any charge against her with scorn what could i do how could i get at some conclusion as to her character and no one in knew them except as recent acquaintances she was an orphan and as far as i john knew she had never disclosed her former home had been suddenly an idea struck me among my father s friends there was a who had served a long time in india upon the staff and who would be likely to know most of the officers who had been out there since the i sat down at once and having trimmed the lamp proceeded to write a letter to the colonel i told him that i was very curious to gain some about a certain captain who had served in the forty first foot and who had fallen in the war i described the man as well as i could from my recollection of the and then having directed the letter posted it that very night after which feeling that i had done all that could be done i retired to bed with mind too anxious to allow me to sleep part ii i got an answer from where the colonel resided within two days i have it before me as i write and copy it dear bob it said i remember the man well i was with him at and afterwards at he was a curious solitary sort of mortal but a gallant soldier enough for he distinguished himself at and was wounded if i remember right h co was not popular in his corps  they said he was a pitiless cold blooded fellow with no in him there was a rumour too that he was a devil or something of that sort and also that he had the evil eye which of course was all nonsense he had some strange theories i remember about the m power of the human will and the effects of mind upon matter how are you getting on your medical studies never forget my boy that your father s son has every claim upon me and that if i can serve in any way i am always at your command  ever affectionately yours p s  by the way did not fall in action he was killed after peace was declared in a crazy attempt to get some of the eternal fire from the temple there was considerable mystery about his death i read this over several times  at first with a feeling of satisfaction and then with one of disappointment i had come on some curious information and yet hardly what i wanted he was an eccentric man a devil and to have the power of the evil eye i could believe the young lady s eyes when endowed with that cold grey which i had noticed in them once or twice to be capable of any evil which human eye ever wrought but still the superstition was an one was there not more meaning john in that sentence which followed  he had theories of the power of the human will and of the of mind upon matter i remember having once read a quaint which i had imagined to be mere at the time of the power of certain human minds and of effects produced by them at a distance was endowed with some exceptional power of the sort the idea grew upon me and very shortly i had evidence which convinced me of the truth of the supposition it happened that at the very time when my mind was dwelling upon this subject i saw a notice in the paper that our town was to be visited by dr the well known medium and was a man whose performance such as it was had been again and again pronounced to be genuine by competent judges he was far above and had the reputation of being the living authority upon the strange of animal and determined therefore to see what the human will could do even against all the of glaring and a public platform i took a ticket for the first night of the performance and went with several student friends we had secured one of the side boxes and did not arrive until after the performance had begun i had hardly taken my seat before i recognised with his and old mrs sitting in the third or fourth row of the they caught sight of me at almost the same moment and we john bowed to each other the first portion of the lecture was somewhat commonplace the giving tricks of pure with one or two of performed upon a subject whom he had brought with him he gave us an exhibition of too throwing his subject into a trance and then demanding particulars as to the movements of absent friends and the whereabouts of hidden objects all of which appeared to be answered satisfactorily i had seen all this before however what i wanted to see now was the effect of the s will when exerted upon some independent member of the audience he came round to that as the concluding exhibition in his performance i have shown you he said that a subject is entirely by the will of the he loses all power of and his very thoughts are such as are suggested to him by the master mind the same end may be attained without any preliminary process a strong will can simply by virtue of its strength take possession of a weaker one even at a distance and can the impulses and the actions of the owner of it if there was one man in the world who had a very much more highly	edith-wharton

was at least dreaming of what he would do if he were free he shall not be bound by any will of mine and if his heart has gone out to this beautiful creature i must bear it as nobly as i can father used to say  and every day i go back more and more to what he said to me  what you cannot at need sacrifice nobly you are not worthy to possess january i have had a note which me completely tom writes to say that he is going away that i am to forgive him for the shame of having known him and that his address is in a sealed envelope i am not to open it unless there is real need why should he give his address to me january the way aunt has of coming in without knocking stealing in on feet made noiseless by brought her into the sitting room last night while i was in the january twilight and meditating on nothing in particular i knew her slow fashion of opening the door like a at a cupboard as says  so that i was able to compose my face into an appropriate smile of welcome before she was fairly in sitting here alone was her greeting mother is asleep i answered and i was waiting for her to wake aunt seated herself in the chair in tbe room and began to swing her foot as usual daniel s at it again she observed i smiled a little it always me that the troubles of the church should be so often brought to me who am an aunt arrives about once a month on the average with complaints about something they are seldom of any especial weight but it seems to relieve her to tell her which daniel i asked to her a little of course you know that well enough what is it now he won t have any fire in the she answered why not let somebody else take care of the then if you want a fire you don t suppose was her response with a chuckle that he d give up the key to anybody else do you i should think he d be glad to he hold on to that key till he dies retorted aunt with a and i should n t be surprised if he had it buried with him he wouldn t lose the chance of making folks uncomfortable the of a saint oh come aunt you are always so hard on i protested he is always good natured with me i wish you d join the church then and see if you can t keep him in order last night it was so cold at prayer meeting that we were all half frozen and mr had to dismiss the meeting old lady spoke up in the part of it when we were all so chilled that we could n t speak and she said in that little high voice of hers the is very cold to night but i trust that our hearts are warm with the love of christ i laughed at the picture of the half frozen and dear old lady coming to the rescue with a pious jest it was so characteristic but has anybody spoken to i asked you can t speak to him she responded her foot with a violence that seemed to speak celestial anger within i try to after every prayer meeting but he has the lights out before i can say two words i can t stay there in the dark with him and the minute he gets me outside he locks the door and posts off like a streak why not go down to his mill in broad daylight i suggested oh he d stick close to the grinding thing just so he could n t hear and i m afraid of being pitched into the she said laughing you must speak to him he pays some attention to what you say but it s none of my business i don t go to prayer meeting but it s your duty to go she answered with a shrewd smile that showed that she appreciated january her response and if you neglect one duty it s no excuse for another besides you can t be willing to have the whole congregation die of cold so in the end it was somehow fixed that i am to with daniel because the faithful are cold at their it would seem much for them to stay at home and be warm they do not as far as i can see enjoy going but they are miserable if they do not go their trouble them worse than the cold poor things i suppose that i can never be half thankful enough to father for bringing me up without a conscience prayer meetings seem to be a good deal like salt in the boy s definition of something that makes food taste bad if you don t put it on prayer meetings make church uneasy if they do not go if they will go however and if they are better for going or believe they are better or if they are only worse for staying away or suppose they are worse they should not be expected to sit in a cold in january why daniel will not have a fire is not at all clear it may be economy or it may be a lack of it may be for some reason too deep to be discovered i refuse to accept aunt s theory that it is sheer obstinacy and i will beard the in his mill regardless of the danger of the at least he generally to me january came up for me this evening while i was reading to mother s down in the parlor she announced says he wants to see you if you re	charles-dickens
ood i have shaken off the of last night and am more like what father used to tell me to be when i was a of a girl a cheerful as right as a though to be sure i do not know what being as right as a is any more than i did then last night it is true there were circumstances that might have been urged for a week it had been the of a saint weather that took all the snap out of a body s mental fibre mother had had one of her bad days when the pain seemed too dreadful to bear patient angel that she is had been in one of her most despairing fits and the old year looked so dreary behind the new year loomed so hopeless before that there was some excuse for a girl who was tired to the bone with watching and worry if she did not feel exactly cheerful i cannot allow though that it justified her in crying like a watering pot and the pages of her until the whole thing was like a composition written with tears in a school i certainly cannot let this sort of thing happen again and i am thoroughly ashamed that it happened once i will remember that the last day father lived he said he could trust me to be brave both for mother and myself and that i promised  i promised so last night may go and be forgotten as soon as i can manage to forget it to night things are different there has been a beautiful snow fall and the air is so crisp that when i went for a walk at sunset it seemed impossible ever to be weak again mother is wonderfully comfortable and the new year began with a letter to say that george will be at home to morrow mother is asleep like a child the fire is in the best of spirits and does the for itself and for peter who is with content expressed by every hair to the tip of his white tail even is singing in the kitchen a hymn that she thinks is cheerful about sa a a e ter er er noon it is evident that there is every opportunity to take a january fresh start and to conduct myself in the coming year with more self respect so much for new year resolutions i do not remember that i ever made one before and very likely i shall never make one again now i must decide something about i tried to talk with mother about her but mother got so excited that i saw it would not do and felt i must work the problem out with pen and paper as if it were a sum in it is not my business to attend to the education of the minister s daughter especially as it is the minister s daughter and he with his whole congregation thinks it rather doubtful whether it is not sinful for even to know so dangerous an i sometimes doubt whether my good neighbors in would regard tom himself who father used to say as the for all rural new england with greater horror than they do me it is fortunate that they do not dislike me personally and they all loved father in spite of his in this case i am not clear on the other hand that it is my duty to stand passive and see without at least protesting a sensitive imaginative delicate child driven to despair by the misery and terror of a creed if had not come to me it would be different but she has come time after time this poor little morbid creature has run to me in such terror of hell fire that i verily feared she would end by going frantic ten years old and desperate with conviction of original sin and this so near the end of the nineteenth century so called of grace thus far i have contented myself with taking her into my arms and just loving her into calmness but she is getting beyond that the of a saint she is finding being so delightful that she is sure it must be a sin she is like what i can fancy the most imaginative of the to have been in their passionate childhood in the days when the only recognized office of the imagination was to picture the terrors of hell i so long for father if he were alive to talk to her he could say the right word and settle things the bible is very touching in its phrase as one whom his mother but to me whom his father would have seemed to go even deeper but then there is s father whose tenderness is killing her i don t in the least doubt that he suffers as much as she does but he loves her too much to risk damage to what he calls her immortal soul there is always a ring of triumph in his voice when he the phrase as if he already were a spirit in eternal and infinite glory there is something finely noble in such a superstition all this however does not bring me nearer to the end of my sum for the answer of that ought to be what i shall do with it would never do to push her into a struggle with the or to set her to arguing out the impossibility of her she is too young and too morbid and would end by supposing that in reasoning at au on the matter she had committed the sin her father would not let her read stories unless they were books perhaps she might be allowed some of the more entertaining of history but she is too young for most of them she should be reading about bed hood and the white cat and the	charles-dickens

air hung trail from s house has turned back several travellers who were bent on the trip but i had been told that it was quite safe on a horse and keeping under my fears as best i could i let me and began the ascent which is visible from here for an the is as nearly perpendicular as can be not a bush or hardly a of any green thing clothes its bare sides it on the sea at a height of feet up this wall something like a sheep track from thirty to forty six inches broad goes in great swinging sometimes as broken s of rock breast high at others as a smooth ledge with hardly in three places away by heavy rains  altogether the most frightful ti that imagination can conceive it was most unpleasant to see the guide s horse and looking eveiy now and then as if about to fall over backwards my horse went up wisely and nobly but slipping jumping and sending stones over the ledge now and then hanging for a second by his fore feet the the of schools has since told me that there is a track as bad if not worse in the district on letter xvi we went the and worse it grew the was loose so as not to the horse s the broad which usually passes under the body having been fastened round his chest and yet it was once or twice necessary to run the risk of losing my balance by taking my left foot out of the to press it against the horse s neck to prevent it from being crushed while my right hung over tlie precipice we came to a place where the path had been carried away leaving a of loose sand and gravel you can hardly realize how difficult it was to when there was no margin outside the horse i somehow under him being careful not to turn the saddle and getting hold of his hind leg myself round carefully behind him it was alarming to see these sm e footed creatures struggle and slide in the

could only tip over the dizzy ridge that the valley and laboriously descend into its heat and silence the track is as steep and broken as that which goes up from hence but not nearly so narrow and

travel so very far it is below but the of the track makes it accessible in an hour from the summit as we descended houses and a church which had looked like toys at first dilated on our sight the silver ribbon became a stream the on the meadows turned into horses the white line on the pacific beach turned into a curling wave and lower still i saw people who had seen us coming down hastily shuffling into clothes there were four houses huddled between the and the river and six or eight with a church and on the other side and between these and the ocean a steep narrow beach composed of large stones worn as round and smooth as cannon balls on which the surf the whole year round the which walls in the valley on the other side is inaccessible the school children and a gi eat part of the population had assembled in front of tlie house which i described before there was a sort of of rough stones round it difficult to climb but the natives though they are very kind did not on this or any similar occasion offer me any help which neglect i suppose arises from the fact that the native women never need help as they are as strong fearless and active as the men and rival them in swimming and other sports an old man clothed only with his dark skin was baked for in front of the house a woman vith flowers in her hair but apparently not otherwise clothed was up to lier waist in

are the observed of all there wave them a last good bye for we must go down to our cabin and dress for where is asked a most melodious voice or at least one that sounded melodious to a certain pair of ears i t know i m sure he s old enough to take care of himself he may be old enough but as they turned the eyes of miss van looked straight into those of who was standing a few feet from her he was much pleased to note that not the faintest sign of recognition their depths it was evident that so far as she knew she now saw the haired young man for the first time the test was a good one felt that he need have no further fears as far as she was concerned the next test would be that of the brother though so far as he could judge had not observed him at all during the adventure of the bay he was thrown into the water at precisely the same moment as his sister and had seemed quite sufficiently engaged with a sugar princess out studying the individual countenances about him neither of the other persons in the sailing party were among the passengers though thought he discerned the features of miss among those on shore as he walked slowly from the place where he had been standing a appearing gentleman called his attention to the pair who were just disappearing through a doorway you know who they are i suppose he said mrs van of and her daughter was a little proud that he could impart information on so interesting a subject or at least show he was not ignorant at what seemed to have excited general remark yes assented the gentleman the daughter has been in for several years acquiring her education she has a brother on board also william replied apparently crushed by finding that the young man knew as much on the subject as he did himself the gentleman moved on but the presence of the van seemed to set everybody to talking the most absolute strangers found the matter sufficient to justify remarks to each other before the bell rang half the passengers had exchanged information about it incidentally giving their names or exchanging cards with the freedom that exists among americans on an ocean my name is i am from in the business who are you was the usual for a sugar princess with variations one remarked to see that fellow in the brown they say that s general s son father in the regular army you know going out to the islands to buy coffee lands or i heard that man by the door say he s lived for twenty years at do you know his name there was a wild anxiety for the information as to their fellow passengers most of the people in the smoking room made feel in the race the steward aided and to some extent by the had arranged the seats in the dining saloon and when each descended he found a little card bearing his name on the plate assigned him some of these were assigned by request so that friends might be seated near together many of those least used to travel had asked specially to be placed at the captain s table under the impression that it would give them an air of importance in the eyes of their less fortunate fellows wiser ones had put in a claim for the s but in both cases some were necessarily doomed to disappointment having no particular choice among a party of people with whom he had no previous acquaintance waited to take any seat that might be given him he was rather surprised therefore when the steward the list in his hand for the time to hear him say mr at the left hand of the the table was not a large one and the majority of those seated there were ladies on the s right was a mrs going out to meet her husband a sugar princess in next to her was a married couple mr and mrs who turned out to be thy people for pleasure next to was the rev love joy the gentleman to whom he had already spoken on deck a mrs colonel with two grown daughters completed the list the soup was hardly served before mrs began to whisper question to the in relation to the van whose backs were toward the party as they sat in a row at the captain s table the great subject was too important to drop even in the midst of a meal you ve heard about that terrible accident of course wasn t it a narrow escape i was talking with mrs she s a great friend of the van and she said it was simply awful s got over it well hasn t she you can t see any trace of it those girls are so strong they say she didn t mind the at all and never once lost her presence of mind before the could open his mouth to reply mrs broke in there never was any real danger miss van learned to swim when she was a child and with the little has ridden a in the at

case first because only three months delay is allowed him instead of twelve secondly because if he does not gain protection by this translation he gains nothing in return for this expense the state him in the translation of a book is another matter that is property in its form but a translation of an play is not at all in book form it is mere waste paper if not played in a theatre to be at all then it must be in some degree protected against theatrical but the protection would be not limited but if the or his could be out of all the theatres by mere of his own invention add to all this that the fair in connection seems to moderate extreme views on either side and to between the rest of the and the that by inviting to expenses hold out hopes of an equivalent the use of this fair that some kind of might be unfair and not permitted if the ended there it would almost follow that an so close to the invention and its title as to thrust the foreign version out of all chance in the english theatrical market is forbidden by but then come the words but only to prevent these words are not in the act but they are in the treaty and though they are not the words the rely upon i think a judge would attach the most weight to them is the stress here on or on that is the question if no more followed i should say on the but then the succeeding seems to imply the stress is to be on it us the courts of law in each country are to decide whether any work is an imitation or a p now this sentence and the independent from the use of the word fair strengthen one another for it can in no case require a court of law to decide so naked a thing as whether any dramatic piece is a translation or an imitation parties would never join issue on this it is not of a character but the powers are clearly providing for a genuine difficulty a knot a third consideration seems to throw the weight upon the fair and rather than upon the sub the eighth musical are here put on the same footing as dramatic now what do the act and treaty intend by a fair of the notes of a musical composition dearly not any whatever which shall not be a translation why musical notes are not the french notes of pour la are its notes the contrast then must be sought elsewhere the fair or fair imitation of a musical composition must surely mean one that takes much of the cream but not all not quite enough to destroy the invention as property in some such sense as this the words fair and fair imitation can be reasonably applied to plays and to musical how else can they be to fit both this then i think is what the powers meant to say if y of course they have not said it in this discussion i have been faithful to my plan and laid before you not my more recent discoveries but the views i held from the logic of into whose wheel i have just ventured to put a spoke won the day in england  hollow and by way of comment of french plays came out one another closer to the french text than they were before the treaty a then the french press with remarks sometimes angry sometimes on the low cunning with which a nation of had a nation of warriors and artists these remarks gave me great pain they were exaggerated but i could not deceive myself into thinking them i used to say to them you are wrong to take any interpretation but an english judge s in england nobody knows what an act of parliament means till it has received its construction in a court of law the himself has not an idea what he means till the judges tell him try the question said i but here the vile reputation our courts have got not for their but for bleeding the came in the way they dared not go into an english court of law a this was a mere accident owing to the of increasing as it naturally would still it shows how completely was the treaty the eighth on a rotten sure of nothing but being a mr l the dramatic the french pieces for some years in compliance with the but at last he was persuaded the whole thing was a and declined to pay the english government any more solid for an empty shadow the on this side the water relieved of all their fears indulged in the insolence of settled triumph they made especially merry over a proposal for a de that appeared in french journals and a water agent whom the french appointed to protect their british rights poor wretches i they did not see it was the national they were grinning over and that france had the best of the bargain a er ail since she was and we disgraced whilst these were grinning i know who was and blushing so would you if you knew how worthy french authors are how valuable and hearty is their good opinion where they can give it how highly their own nation it and how vile an estimate they formed and expressed of english writers morals and delicacy in this state of things i learned to my delight that there was another englishman who thought with me and what is much acted as he thought mr without any communication with me had since the

one man while you love another she started at the statement made so simply i am married to a man whom i do not love and who does not love me he returned to the question after the manner of lawyers and there is another whom you would have married had you consulted your heart alone you surely do not expect me to admit that she stammered faintly no i will answer it for you i know it is true i have known it for a long time she touched his arm with her fingers as gently as if it were brushed by the wing of a bird how did you know she whispered i cannot tell i suppose it was instinct for yon have never uttered a word to me on the subject i could their marriage bond not speak to you about it when your marriage was already decided upon the problem was too great for me to solve i could only remain silent and resolve to shield you if i found anything crawling across your path the woman shuddered the things that crawl have no power to do me harm she said earnestly many a woman has thought that and discovered her error said mr the only is in the love of a true husband the loss the terrible loss that she had suffered rolled over s mind like a wave the love of a true husband what had she what was she likely to have to fill its place i am in a delicate position said mr later in the evening there are many things i might say were not the atmosphere so clouded let us leave it this way if there is anything in which i can help you promise to call on me without hesitation i will do so she replied fervently it was something to a woman who had so few persons on whom she could rely she saw the tall form of the lawyer depart half an hour later with a sense of gratitude for his interest in her that passed the power of expression mr s determination that he would find the whereabouts of miss rivers suffered no as the weeks glided by with that strange double consciousness which is often noted he attended to his business in a manner that gave his associates no occasion for fault while beneath the talk of and coffee the image of margaret was ever clearly their marriage bond he made a new arrangement with the firm of and a man was detailed to shadow both mr and his office at all hours if margaret had been to see the attorney once she might come again if she did not come she might write if she did neither might go to meet her at some other place possibly the very one in which she was living the vigilance of the was at last rewarded miss rivers entered the lawyer s office and when she emerged was followed to a house in cambridge where she was did not hesitate long when he learned under which roof his idol was to be found that very evening he took the street car from boston and went to call upon her i believe there is a lady here he said to the servant who answered his ring mrs yes so she had resumed her own name tell her a gentleman wishes to see her the servant was gone several minutes when she returned she said mrs rivers wished to know the name of her taking a from his pocket mr wrote a few words on a leaf and tore it out give her this he said he had written i must see you for a few minutes unless you utterly hate me do not refuse this boon the messenger returned with the request that he walk upstairs the lady he wished to see was in the rear room on the first floor an instant later he had mounted the steps and not even pausing to knock had opened the door and stood in the presence of his beloved when she received his note and knew what she bad their marriage bond at first that it was mr who was waiting margaret had been thrown into a state of excitement her first impulse was to decline to see him then she reflected that a man of his temperament could not be put off so easily that having discovered her home he would insist on meeting her at all costs she would have to let him in notwithstanding the agreement she had entered into with mr she was holding the baby in her arms when the message came and for a few moments she contemplated various plans for of that young gentleman until after the conference was ended but as she glanced about the room she saw that there were many proofs of his existence besides his own self a stood by her bed little garments were scattered here and there and then there came over the young mother an irresistible yearning to show this part of herself and of him to the long absent father she wanted to gaze into the eyes of her former lover when they first encountered those of his offspring so she met him standing in the centre of the room with the baby in her arms his astonishment was intense for a few seconds he was fairly dazed by the spectacle it was her child he did not for an instant doubt that something of the with which painters crown the over the head of every young mother margaret he stammered margaret a thrill of delight shot through her bosom sit down she said you did not know of this she added when he had been persuaded though with difficulty to accept the invitation to be

and brilliant idea and for half an hour he kept up a most tremendous thinking now or never said he as he rose and walked down the road towards centre the adventures of chapter v in which gives his note sixty dollars a great idea was born in s brain his mother s weakness and the of her position were more apparent to him than they had ever been before she was in the power of her who might turn her out of the little black house sell the place at and thus perhaps deprive her of the whole or a large part of his father s and her own hard but this was not the peculiar hardship of her situation as her devoted son understood it it was not the hard work alone which she was called upon to perform not the of the fare upon which they lived not the danger even of being turned out of doors that distressed it was that a wretch like mr could insult and upon his now ob ok mother he had just heard him use language to her that made his blood boil with indignation and he did not on cool sober second thought regret that he had taken such a decided stand against it he cared not for himself he could live on a crust of bread and a cup of water from the spring he could sleep in a barn he could wear coarse and even ragged clothes but he could not submit to have his mother insulted and by such a mean and contemptible person as mr yet what could he do he was but a boy and the great world would look with contempt upon his form but he felt that he was not altogether insignificant he had performed an act that day which the fair young lady to whom he had rendered the service had declared very few men would have undertaken there was something in him something that would come out if he only put his best foot forward it was a tower of strength within him it told him that he could do wonders that he could go out into the world and accomplish all that would be required to free his mother from debt and relieve her from the severe of her life the adventures of bright a great many people think they can do wonders the vanity of some very silly people makes them think they can command armies govern nations and teach the world what the world never knew before and never would know but for them but s something within him was not vanity it was something more substantial he was not thinking of becoming a great man a great general a great ruler or a great not even of making a great fortune self was not the idol and the end of his calculations he was thinking of his mother and only of her and the feeling within him was as pure and holy and beautiful as the dream of an angel he wanted to save his mother from insult in the first place and from a life of ceaseless in the second a of angels seemed to have in his soul to give him strength for the great purpose in his mind his was a holy and a true purpose and it was this that made him think he could do wonders what intended to do the reader shall know in due time it is enough now that he meant to do something the difficulty with a great many people ob or is that they never resolve to do something they wait for something to turn up and as things are often very obstinate they utterly refuse to turn up at all their lives are spent in waiting for a golden opportunity which never comes now bright the philosophy he would have nothing to do with it he did not believe corn would grow without being planted or that would bite the bare hook i am not going to tell my young readers now how made out in the end but i can confidently say that if he had waited for something to turn up he would have become a vagabond a out of money out at the elbows and out of patience with himself and all the world it was now or never with he meant to do something and after he had made up his mind how and where it was to be done it was no use to stand thinking about it like the of the old clock which had stood for fifty years in a farmer s kitchen without giving its owner any cause of complaint walked down the road towards the village the of with a rapid step he was thinking very fast and probably that made him step quick but as he approached squire lee s house his pace and he seemed to be very uneasy when he reached the great gate that led up to the house he stopped for an instant and thrust his hands down very deep into his trousers pockets i cannot tell what the trousers pockets had to do with what he was thinking about but if he was searching for any thing in them he did not find it for after an instant s hesitation he drew out his hands struck one of them against his chest and in an audible voice exclaimed  now or never all this i suppose meant that had some as to the ultimate success of his mission at squire lee s and that when he struck his breast and uttered his favorite expression they were conquered and driven out marching with a bold and determined step up to the squire s back door  s ideas of etiquette would not have answered for the of fashionable society  he gave three smart s heart beat a little wildly as he	isabella-lucy-bird

sound as he lay awake on his narrow iron bed but it seemed to him against the spirit of the place he would not smoke although he had the soldier s fondness for a pipe many a dreary evening beneath a hastily built shelter of boughs when the rain poured down and everything was he had found solace in the curling smoke but now it seemed to him that it would be and at times he almost felt as if it would be selfish too they cannot smoke you know down there under the wet grass he thought as standing at the window he looked toward the ranks of the stretching across the eastern end from side to

blank remained silent and the keeper after pulling up a weed or two and the grass over his relative went to his duties again i am convinced that blank is a relative he said to himself distant perhaps but still a one april day the heat was almost but the sun s rays were not those brazen beams that sometimes in cities burn the air and the to a white heat  rather were they soft and still the moist earth her richness not a leaf stirred and the whole level country seemed sitting in a hot bath in the early dawn the keeper had performed his tasks but all day he remained almost without stirring in his chair between two windows striving to exist at high noon out came a little black bringing his supplies from the town whistling and shuffling along gay as a lark the keeper watched him coming slowly down the white road by the way in the hot blaze stopping to turn a or two to over a bridge rail to execute various all by himself he reached the gate at last entered and having come all the way

way demanded the keeper the little black grinned but made no reply unless the hot white sand with his black toes could be as such he now removed his hat and made a bow is it or is it not warm asked

to those who feeling at enmity with him call on the rocks to cover them but do you know i believe the sense of love will ever in those who feel it over the sense of power and that if i felt a bond of union existing between us i should strain my eyes towards him rather than turn them away even though she added in a low voice they were by excess of brightness a long pause followed meanwhile the sky cleared i shall look out again for james said she presently he and i are all the world to one another now and though i have no fears for myself i sometimes have for him i should think he had come to harm if he were not the most in the world by the bye we were talking of signs of the times do you know that coloured clouds of smoke last year v she added smiling not indeed green red and white but black yellow and white ah black and yellow are the colours said i m afraid is still in the interest there s the exclaimed miss standing right into the bay you can t see her without the glass  here it is she seemed to rise suddenly from the sea i see a white speck said but are you sure it is the v o yes i know the cut of her which by the bye is too large i own i am glad to see her in safety for i am always expecting her to go over but this bay is as quiet as a lake not always though said you forget the and the perhaps i should not think much of either said miss her look out whether you creep close hauled under the land or stand boldly out to sea there is not much danger here at any time i fancy and then you have no tides and scarcely any currents how slowly the comes in there is hardly air enough to fan her sails even the sailed boats do not their to day it is getting very hot said yes and presently we shall no longer be in the shade i shall go in and stir up to make some addition to our dinner james won t thank her for she went in but remained taking a lazy pleasure in watching the little which after all was making very good way miss was in no hurry to him as an occasional glance from the window to show her the s progress but in about three quarters of an hour she came out looking very brisk and began waving her handkerchief  which her brother was now near enough to see at length the little vessel one of the smallest of its kind brought to in deep water though close in shore and while remained where he was miss went to welcome her brother a good tempered looking man of forty who stepped out shook hands with her and kissed her they proceeded at once towards the inn talking gaily and rapidly and apparently over looking but miss stopping short beckoned to him and presented him to her brother polite words were exchanged and then turning shy bowed low and said he would remove from them the inconvenience of his presence mind you come again soon then cried miss as he rapidly walked off who is that young spark v said the captain oh a very nice lad son of a country gentleman in the neighbourhood the family name is he was very civil to me the first day i came here and has helped to the time since while i have been waiting for you you fellow and the had captain laughed and said you might as well expect a duck to founder she is and winged what do you think i ve been about i ve run all round then stood out for passed through the straits of and saw the group then we got into a little basin which seemed to have no outlet then we touched at la and off a little island in its vicinity there was a tall powerful man fishing the fellow i have on board told me it was general really well i should have liked to see him you know he is a remarkable man o yes distinguished himself in and also in south america well we next had a good run along how i should have liked to be with you why i wanted you to you said you preferred riding so i did and i liked it very much get into any trouble y no once a man sprang from a hedge and  laid his hand on my bridle but i him across the eyes and rode on well done oh it s no good being too particular here he might have had comrades behind the hedge with fire arms for anything i know the whole country seems and troubled beneath the surface that youth you saw just now is full of high aspirations but as simple as a baby i have been trying to spirit him up a little to make a man of himself suppose we take him a v chapter xvi a little sail ell said captain next morning at breakfast shall we have a little sail hum  i think not it is blowing rather too fresh you re afraid of being no afraid of being drowned well i think the a little thing i always told you so you told me yesterday evening that the sea here was always as smooth as glass it has been so ever since i was here nevertheless poor was lost on this coast don t call him poor  fellow i all the less fit to die certainly but i think your pity may be better bestowed says there are very ugly here sometimes i thought you were	charles-darwin
despatch a gentleman left for with the apparent intention of upon you a serious injury there was a sarcastic curl to the frenchman s lip his touched by the you have hardly made the point plain yet he remarked i will do so i answered the gentleman s name was do you understand now not in the least he replied promptly i confessed myself much puzzled by this answer m had a friend an intimate friend said i who had a violent attachment for miss having learned of your intimate relations with that lady col uttered a loud exclamation my relations with with miss he cried exactly what relations he inquired i am getting out of patience the relations i said sharply that made you the father of her child for a moment the frenchman eyed me with an expression that i could not are you sane he asked or some madman escaped from confinement apparently in the possession of my senses i said boldly i am of the estate of and have the best of reasons for the interest i take in this matter your manner is a strange one after the pains i have taken to warn you of your danger the next sentence uttered by m was so mixed with that i fear to use it in this narrative all his polite vanished he informed me roughly that he was afraid of nothing that walked the earth or traversed the air if had gone to to call him to account for anything i had done a great wrong to put him in the position of a coward as to the lady whose name i had used his only connection with her was on the unfortunate occasion which m had promptly he had never met her before or since that day if she had become an mother which he would have sworn impossible on any other evidence than mine he could easily guess her child s though wild horses should not drag his suspicions out of him and he rattled on at this rate for at least five minutes until he was so exhausted by his efforts that he could proceed no farther somewhat abashed by the failure of my great discovery i begged the officer s pardon for my mistake then i told him the history of the family the strange ideas advanced by the daughter and what facts i knew concerning the birth of her son he grew calmer as i proceeded and listened with the deepest interest uttering many ah s and oh s r i give you my word as an officer and a gentleman he said when i had concluded that i never spoke a syllable to miss but once and that i never saw her alone what i did was to use a great clue exploded for which i am ashamed while under the influence of strong liquor to which i am m acting under the impulse of the moment drew a revolver and shot me precisely as he ought to have done if i had been killed i should have received only my just deserts as it was my life was cut short the doctors tell me another year is all i can count on with certainty you see i nothing i have succeeded in poor and now i await the execution of my own sentence the the gentleness the politeness of the frenchman had returned with full force i have never seen such perfect combination of courtesy bravery and manhood why did you lay this sin at my door he asked after a pause on account of a chain of evidence that seemed sufficient i replied in a discouraged tone i saw m while he was his imprisonment at although we exchanged but one glance he knew that i with him after his release we met accidentally and travelled together he told me he was convicted of a brother officer with intent to kill he said the cause was an insult to a lady so gross that it set his blood on fire then he related how the injured man had labored to save him and had finally obtained his release i easily recognized miss as the probable heroine of this tale and informed m that i intended to return to and ascertain your to this he answered quietly that he would save me that trouble giving me your name and address after obtaining it i told him my out of that you were s father he replied absurd but did not convince me in writing to miss who was then in america i told her what i had learned though not all i guessed in doing this i alluded to m as my as soon as she could reach me i was at sur she came i found her much excited she asked me again and again to repeat what i had heard when i reached my conclusion tha ty u were her child s father she only cried oh and had difficulty in her tears within a short time i found that she was holding with afterward she begged me to accompany her back to seeming to carry with her a most secret everything continued to point to you as far as i could see miss and myself were pursuing our separately and i was kept in the dark completely as far as she was concerned the climax came this noon when in one moment there was placed in my hands a letter stating that she had fled the country and a card containing your name what could i think but that the knowledge of your arrival had caused her flight m bowed a lt was a strange combination he said you started with a wrong and each step you took was consequently but who is this fellow whose friend is to fight or me i never heard of a man of his description was it was it	arthur-conan-doyle
hint of what had e felt somewhat in the dark however it was useless to conjecture when had done what he wanted to do at  whatever that might be  he would come to with mr explain himself meanwhile possessed his soul in patience and wished that would come down to the s house when he descended to breakfast and mrs entered with her of gossip he learned that major had driven through early that morning on his way to he came down by the night train i hear sir said mrs was very well satisfied as this arrival provided him with work for the day apparently had seen mrs on the previous day and had what took place from the widow or her mother and tub sealed message ft was possible that he had come to the street to ask wh t he meant by with the case there he would learn that the  as he regarded  had gone oil to and so had come down post haste by the next train he could catch all this argued a guilty conscience and took his way to later in the morning to have it out with his enemy it occurred to him that was guilty after all the day was not so hot as the previous one had been so walked to he could have obtained a horse or a as on the two former occasions but preferred to use his legs the country was very beautiful and the air most so he enjoyed the journey and arrived at without hurrying himself when he came in sight of the s house he felt in his pocket to make sure that his revolver was safe was a desperate man and might make an attack after the fashion of therefore it was as well to be on the safe side thus ready for any emergency he rang the bell at the big gates which were again closed and bolted in less time than he expected the g les were thrown open by the mild faced of whom had last seen in london my is expecting you sir said the stepping back to permit the visitor to enter in fact sir he down here immediately after you for an interview i have been watching at the gates all the morning how did major know that i was in asked and received the expected reply  that had inquired at his street rooms while the up the narrow path which between and looked hard at wondering if this like the sealed message knew of s affairs but the mild face of the betrayed nothing he looked like a sheep and probably was one major did not care for over clever servants probably he had learned a lesson when off who knew far too much the old place looked very beautiful in the warm golden light and caught a glimpse of the lawn whereon had danced he sighed to think of what had happened since that wonderful night a gulf had opened between the girl and the world which could only be by an open confession by as to the truth of the murder but had very little time to for the led him swiftly through the and into the house he preceded the visitor up a shallow staircase and along a spacious passage on the first floor on knocking at a door and being to enter he introduced into a large room with no less than five windows looking out on to the tangled avenue and rough and this was apartment  as had been told when he came to see  and it was furnished so as to be a pleasant prison for the unfortunate girl bad as was he had done his best to make voluntary  that is it could be called voluntary since the major had told her that all english girls were brought up in seclusion and she had how are you said the major when his man had shut the door and they were alone together in the splendid room t have been expecting you so i have been given to understand by your replied coolly and sat down to take out his pipe you don t object to my smoking i presume  the sealed message smiled grimly no he rejoined deliberately you may need soothing before our conversation ends dear me that sounds threatening are you going to murder me or drop me into an if so i advise you to think twice about it the police at know that i am here i told a young in the high street where i was going i don t see why you should do that said sharply i do rejoined the young man calmly you are a dangerous man and you are being driven into a corner however if you think to silence me by violence you will only get yourself into difficulties you are afraid the major oh not at all retorted although his fair face flushed a trifle there is no question of that the mere fact that i come here alone is enough to prove that i do not fear you he lighted his pipe carefully and looked along the stem at his host fire away sat down in a comfortable chair with his back to the window probably so that should not read his face too easily he was neatly dressed in a smoking suit and looked as and span as though he had just stepped out of a band box but then being something of a lady had always been attentive to his personal appearance he suited the room very well as he looked high bred and bland and amiable what do you wish me to say he asked quietly that is for you to judge answered lazily but very attentive to s slightest movement you say that you expected me well i presume that means you have something	mark-twain

children for illustration of one of the ways in which a child may be led into the heart of a poem i have i use of literature chosen the tiger by this belongs to the of literature constantly taken for use with children because it is to be beautiful yet which constantly fails in its appeal to a class it is to me one of the most wonderful in the language yet i doubt if it would ever have occurred to me to use it in our common schools and certainly i should never have dreamed that it was to be presented to children in the lower i do not know with what in general may have used it but in one or two boston schools with which i happen to be fairly well acquainted the effect is pretty justly represented by the mental attitude of the small lad spoken of in the next chapter the extent to which children in a sort of mechanical compliance in what to them are the of their elders in the matter of can hardly be exaggerated doubtless they often unconsciously gain much of which they do not dream in the way of the development of taste and perception but too often the whole of the instruction given along lines over them without producing any permanent effect of value of course i do not contend that not advancing unless they know it early training in literature may often be of the highest without definite consciousness on the part of the child self analysis is no more to be expected here than anywhere else in the early stages of training the child does not in the least comprehend for tales on teaching literature instance that the of mother goose as they are are sense of he does not understand that his imaginative powers are being nourished by the the normal mental food for a certain stage of the development of the individual as it is the natural and inevitable product of a corresponding stage in the development of the race so long as a child genuine interest iii a poem or a tale he is getting something from it but lie does not concern himself to consider anything beyond present enjoyment in the earlier stages at least and for that matter at any stage th e thing to be secured is interest and in the lower school should be confined to what is actually needed to make children enjoy a given piece anything beyond this may wisely be deferred in many of the lower it is now the fashion to have children act out poems the method is spoken of with satisfaction by teachers who have tried it i know nothing of it by experience but should it might be good if not carried too far children are naturally and advantage may be taken of tliis fact to their imagination and to their to literature if seriousness and sincerity are not forgotten in this early work it does not seem to me that much can wisely be done in the study of indeed i have serious doubts whether much in the way of the examination of the of properly has place anywhere in use of literature preparatory schools the child however should be trained gradually to notice by having attention called to passages which are especially musical or impressive by with ringing and strongly and leading on to effects more delicate the teacher may do much in this line i have called this early work because it be directed to making literature a pleasure and an inspiration the word clumsy as it may seem does express the real function of art and the only function which may with any profit be considered in the earlier stages of the study of literature the object is to make the children care for good to show them that poetry has a meaning for them and to awaken in them  although they will be from ing the fact  a to not be aware that he is being given higher views of life that he is being trained to some perception of nobler aims and possibilities greater than are presented by common experiences but this is what is really being accomplished any training which opens the eyes to the finer side of life is in the best and truest sense inspiration and it should be the distinct aim of the teacher to see to it that whatever else may happen in the lower or in the higher this chief function of the teaching of literature shall not be lost sight of or neglected viii as s to attempt to give a of the method in which any teaching is to be carried on ib in a way to try for the impossible every class and every pupil must be treated according to the especial nature of the case and the personal of the teacher i expose myself to the danger of seeming if i here an experience of ray own and what is of more consequence i may possibly obscure the very points i am to make clear am well as i can however i shall set down an actual talk in the hope that it may afford some hint of the way in which even difficult pieces of literature may be made to appeal to a child of course this is not in the least meant as a model but solely and simply as an illustration i once a fine little fellow of eight what he was doing at school he answered  because this happened to be the task which at the moment was most

effect of the remarks he meant to make in the bundle of time the applause which now followed as a matter of course would hardly be so ready then he reflected with a ghastly sense of humor he clapped when the sat down remarking to himself that he was glad the speaker s rather unusual of mouth and forehead was not his and then almost with a shock he realized that his cousin richard was on his feet mr had prepared himself most carefully for this ordeal yet he was not wholly free from and as he cleared his voice to begin his air was that of a man who finds unexpected difficulty in getting his words to consent to be uttered tom strangely grown calm bit off the end of a cigar and watched richard with a critical air  a sort of disinterested curiosity as if he already looked back upon his past with vague wonder the speaker grasped firmly his coat collar drew a deep inspiration and went bravely forward with his carefully collected he began to quote he thrust his hand into his pocket and drew out a handful of papers selected a list of figures and laid the others upon the table before him among them was the yellow envelope which tom knew so well a political dinner fixed his eyes upon it as a bird looks into the eyes of a snake which him in telling of it afterward tom declared that it seemed to him he could not move that some irresistible power held him and that had not a special providence interfered in his behalf that envelope would have gone back into richard s pocket providence on this occasion took the form of the of the evening who was seized with a sudden whether from the effect of generous or from a naturally humorous disposition is not apparent in either case it seemed to him an excellent joke to the heap of letters lying beside s plate and them about among those of the guests near him the speaker absorbed in his figures noticed nothing and fate tired of poor tom directed that in the distribution the yellow envelope with several others should come into his trembling fingers when he held the envelope in his hand his powers all re asserted themselves yet so firmly and fully had he determined upon confession that even now the need was removed the heroic resolve did not at once in the bundle of time vanish he looked down at the envelope and with a thrill of scorn so keenly realized in what a slavery he had been living that it seemed necessary to make his declaration in order to regain his self respect to his highly wrought mood it appeared easier to speak than to keep silence in another moment however that common sense which prevents half the noble deeds which but for it would stir the world itself and he smiled at the folly he had almost committed yet it mattered very little since before fortune put this chance into his hand he had conquered in his fight with self and and this was certainly nearer to being a hero than most men ever approach holding the letters carelessly he extracted the check from its and passed the whole bunch to his next neighbor that gentleman in turn handed them to the next man and so in succession each guest handed them until when richard warm with pride and his exertions resumed his seat amid the customary applause the whole was gravely handed to him by the fact man who sat next below him and it was only after the dinner was over that he learned of their a dinner there was a stir of expectation when the having introduced him rose slowly to his feet it was understood well enough what he had to do and however much his companions might wonder they could not but agree that what he attempted he did with grace richard watching him was at once astonished and elated at the hearty and air with which his cousin delivered his opening sentences briefly but forcibly tom ran over the points oi the political situation the need of a strong candidate in the crisis which they all saw approaching he stood easily holding his cigar in his fingers and now and then with the hand that held it his general remarks concluded he took from his pocket a bit of paper leaned forward to touch the end of it to the flame of a candle and with it lit his cigar i do not mean gentlemen he continued when his cigar was well alight and the last of the burned check fell from his fingers to turn this social occasion into a but it is as well to come to an understanding of each other s feelings in order to work with a harmony which shall be effective so that i feel excused for mentioning for your consideration the name of a in the bundle of time date upon whom i think we can all agree and whom so far at least as i can speak we could heartily unite in supporting richard modestly cast down his eyes while a deeper hush fell upon the company these men were and it is probable that their objections to the they expected were based upon grounds of rather than upon moral conviction yet being in a situation where they realized that the better feelings of the masses might be taken advantage of they regretted the loss of an opportunity to be so virtuous they were prepared to it is true but they were not wholly reconciled to giving up the rare luxury of being at once honest and successful as for tom it was even then with the ashes of the fatal paper lying before him only by a mighty effort that he held himself to his task he leaned forward	charles-dickens

himself in a somewhat situation some years ago said the doctor thoughtfully his device was a singular one he deliberately committed a offence and so compelled the young lady s people to withdraw their

well then i might write it now and start to eh perhaps you would let me use your desk thank you i am so sorry to keep you from your guests so long but i won t be a moment now he wrote an abrupt note of a few lines then with a sudden impulse he tore it to and flung it into the fireplace no i can t sit down and tell her a lie doctor he said rising we must find some other way out of this i will

and into the broad bars of darkness between it was but his own shadow which up the wall as he passed the lights and yet it looked to the doctor s eye as though some huge and sombre figure walked by a

and turned him sick and faint while he read it a the third generation deplorable accident it was headed and it ran in this way a fatal accident of a peculiarly painful character is reported from king william street about eleven o clock last night a young man was observed while endeavouring to get out of the way of a to slip and fall under the wheels of a heavy two horse on being picked up his injuries were found to be of the most shocking character and he expired while being conveyed to the hospital an examination of his and shows beyond any question that the deceased is none other than sir francis of park who has only within the last year come into the the accident is made the more deplorable as the deceased who was only just of age was on the eve of being married to a young lady belonging to one of the oldest families in the south with his wealth and his talents the ball of fortune was at his feet and his many friends will be deeply grieved to know that his promising career has been cut short in so sudden and tragic a fashion a false start is dr at home i am he pray step in the visitor looked somewhat astonished at having the door opened to him by the master of the house i wanted to have a few words the doctor a pale nervous young man dressed in an professional long black frock coat with a high white collar cutting oflf his in the centre rubbed his hands together and smiled in the thick man in front of him he scented a patient and it would be his first his scanty resources had begun to run somewhat low and although he had his first quarter s rent safely locked away in the drawer of his desk it was becoming a question with him how he should meet the current expenses of his very simple housekeeping he bowed therefore waved his visitor in closed the hall door in a careless fashion as though his own presence had been a purely accidental a false start and finally led the stranger into his furnished front room where he him to a seat dr planted himself behind his desk and placing his finger tips together he gazed with some apprehension at his companion what was the matter with the man he seemed very red in the face some of his old professors would have his

in any sudden way during the journey between and there must have been some official inquiry and his luggage would have to have established his identity yet the police had been communicated with and had returned a positive answer that no had been held or any body found which could by any possibility be that of the young englishman the only alternative appeared to be that he had taken the first opportunity to break all the old ties and had slipped away to the or to the states to commence life anew under an altered name why he should do this no one professed to know but that he had done it appeared only too probable from the facts hence many a deep growl of righteous anger rose from the when mary with her pale face and sorrow sunken head passed along the on her way to her daily and it is more than likely that if the missing man had turned up in he might have met with some rough words or usage unless he could give some very good reason for his strange conduct this popular view of the case never however occurred to the simple trusting heart of the lonely girl and as years rolled by her grief and her suspense were never i john for an instant tinged with a doubt as to the good faith of the missing man from youth she grew into middle age and from that into the autumn of her life patient long suffering and faithful doing good as far as lay in her power and waiting humbly until fate should restore either in this world or the next that which it had so mysteriously deprived her of in the meantime neither the opinion held by the that john was dead nor that of the majority which pronounced him to be represented the true state of the case still alive and of honour he had yet been out by fortune as her victim in one of those strange which are of such rare occurrence and so beyond the general experience that they might be put by as incredible had we not the most evidence of their occasional possibility landing at with his heart full of hope and courage john selected a dingy room in a back street where the terms were less than elsewhere and conveyed thither the two boxes which contained his worldly goods after taking up his quarters there he had half a mind to change again for the landlady and the fellow were by no means to his taste but the coach started within a day or two and he consoled himself by the thought that the discomfort would only last for that short time having written home to mary to announce his safe arrival he ed himself in seeing as much of the town as john s was possible walking about all day and only returning to his room at night it happened however that the house on which the unfortunate youth had pitched was one which was notorious for the character of its inmates he had been directed to it by a who found regular employment in hanging about the and new comers to this den the fellow s manner and proffered civility had led the simple hearted west into the toils and though his instinct told him that he was in company he refrained unfortunately from at once making his escape he contented himself with staying out all day and as little as possible with the other inmates from the few words which he did let drop however the landlady gathered that he was a stranger without a single friend in the country to inquire after him should misfortune overtake him the house had an evil reputation for the of sailors which was done not only for the purpose of them but also to supply ships with the men being carried on board insensible and not coming to until the ship was well down the st this trade caused the wretches who followed it to be in the use of and they determined to practise their arts upon their so as to have an opportunity of his effects and of seeing what it might be worth their while to during the day he invariably locked his door and carried oflf the key in s his pocket but if they could render him insensible for the night they could examine his boxes at their leisure and deny afterwards that he had ever brought with him the articles which he missed it happened therefore upon the eve of s departure from that he found upon returning to his lodgings that his landlady and her two ill favoured sons who assisted her in her trade were waiting up for him over a bowl of punch which they cordially invited him to share it was a bitterly cold night and the fragrant steam overpowered any suspicions

had been read and and the regular studies of the were pursued on the fourth day of the voyage the wind came up fresh from the southward bringing with it a dense fog the change of weather was very unwelcome just as the was about to enter the straits of young america in italy and the vessels were close hauled on the port tack and the principal decided that it was not prudent to enter the strait under such the were sailing abreast of each other and almost within hail of the ship the of their bells could be distinctly heard on board at three in the watch the of the ship reported the whistle of a steamer sharp on the lee bow a the ship went ahead the sounds of this signal came from another relative direction and it was soon evident that the steamer was coming out of the strait from the large ship s bell on the was rung every ten seconds the stranger was coming down upon the but nothing could be seen of her the situation was certainly perilous in the extreme and the principal ordered peaks and to fire the guns the of the steamer s wheels could now he plainly heard and in another instant her high bow was seen in the fog directly on the beam of the ship hard a shouted the principal for the first time in a year giving tlie order himself but it was too late the steamer stopped her wheels and then began to back them before the smoke of the two guns had cleared away and before the steamer could wholly check her her struck of the young america the ship s snapped her and the water poured like a young into her hold but the steamer which was working her wheels backward at full speed immediately disengaged herself from the wreck on her decks the utmost confusion prevailed sunny shores or and and screams filled the air on board of the there was no disorder the officers and seemed to be by the shock but every one of them trained to the discipline in kept his station mr peaks go below and report the injury done to the ship said mr the instant the steamer backed away from the ship there is a hole in the side of the ship big enough to drive an in peaks reported half a minute later she will go down in less than five minutes clear away the boats captain said the principal to the young commander all hands leave the ship captain gave the order to the first lieutenant in due form and in another minute the six boats of the ship were in the water and long before the italian steamer had lowered a single boat the ship was settling and every officer seaman professor and waiter took the place assigned to him in the boats without disorder or confusion the greater portion of them saved their most valuable effects indeed the event terrible as it might have been in the night or in the absence of discipline seemed to the students not to be at all the frequent of a similar emergency not a person was lost or injured and no one was even badly frightened at the time of the collision the was on the wing of the fleet her officers and on were attending closely to the fog though they could not see the ship they could hear her bell the guns startled them and called the in italy and principal to the deck at the next instant they heard the crash of the collision without any from mr ordered all hands to he called everybody was filled with anxiety and thrilled by the exciting event steamer dead ahead shouted the on the top gallant hard a lee i cried on the a second collision was thus avoided and under a less efficient state of discipline the might have into the side of the italian steamer and severely upon her for her careless manage clear away the boats said as he received the order from the captain and almost as soon as those of the ship the boats were in the water and fully both of the were lying to by this time and the boats of the were overboard as soon as those of the mr o in the second will pull directly to the steamer and see if she needs any assistance said captain selecting this because he spoke italian as well as french and english o received the order from the first lieutenant and departed upon his mission in a few moments he obtained a view of the ship with her half dozen boats pulling away from her the fog had lifted a little so that he could obtain a fair view of the scene the s boats were rushing towards the sinking ship and so were two from the steamer but it sunny or was plain to o that their services were not needed in a short time he reached the italian steamer and went on board of her nearly all the passengers were forward watching the ship their whole attention absorbed by the exciting scene o reported himself captain on the bridge but was informed that the vessel had sustained no o o cried a young lady closely enveloped in a water proof which the damp air and the chilly breeze rendered necessary exclaimed the second

years older at the least than when first i had seen him i it went to my heart to see this fine old fellow round the red lamp wasting away before my eyes there was the eternal letter which he unfolded with his shaking fingers who was this woman whose words moved him some daughter s or who should have been the light of his home instead of i smiled to find how bitter i was growing and how swiftly i was weaving a romance round an old man and his correspondence yet all day he lingered in my mind and i had fitful glimpses of those two trembling blue hands with the paper rustling between them i had hardly hoped to see him again another day s decline must i thought hold him to his room if not to his bed great then was my surprise when as i approached my bench i saw that he was already there but as i came up to him i could scarce be sure that it was indeed the same man there were the curly hat and the shining and the horn glasses but where were the stoop and the grey pitiable he was clean shaven and firm with a bright eye and a head that poised itself upon his great shoulders like an eagle on a rock his back was as straight and square as a s and he at the i with his stick in his vitality in the button hole of his well brushed black coat there a golden blossom and the comer of a dainty red silk handkerchief over from his breast pocket he might have been the eldest son of the weary creature who had sat there the morning before good morning sir good morning he cried with a merry of his cane good morning i answered how beautiful the bay is looking yes sir but you should have seen it just before the sun rose what have you been here since then i was here when there was scarce light to see the path  you are a very early on occasion sir on occasion he cocked his eye at me as if to whether i were worthy of his confidence the fact is sir that my wife is coming back to me to day i suppose that my face showed that i did not quite see the force of the explanation my eyes too may have given him assurance of sympathy for he moved quite close to me and began speaking in a low confidential voice as if the matter were of such weight that even the sea must be kept out of our are you a married man sir no i am not ah then you cannot quite understand it my wife and i have been married for nearly fifty round the red lamp years and we have never been x ted never at all until now was it for long i asked yes sir this is the fourth day she had to go to scotland a matter of duty you understand and the doctors would not let me go not that i would have allowed them to stop me but she was on their side now thank god it is over and she may be here at any moment here yes here this and bench were old friends of ours thirty years ago the people with whom we stay are not to tell the truth very congenial and we have little privacy among them that is why we prefer to meet here i could not be sure which train would bring her but if she had come by the very earliest she would have found me waiting in that case said i rising no sir no he entreated i beg that you will stay it does not weary you this domestic talk of mine on the contrary i have been so driven during these few last days ah what a nightmare it has been perhaps it may seem strange to you that an old fellow like me should feel like this it is charming no credit to me sir there s not a man on planet but would feel the same if he had the good fortune to be married to such a woman perhaps because you see me like this and hear me speak of our long life together you conceive that she is old too he laughed heartily and his eyes at the humour of the idea she s one of those women you know who have youth in their hearts and so it can never be very far from their faces to me she s just as she was when she first took my hand in hers in a little bit perhaps but then if she had a fault as a girl it was that she was a shade too slender she was above me in station you know  i a clerk and she the daughter of my employer oh it was quite a romance i give you my word and i won her and somehow i have never got over the freshness and the wonder of it to think that that sweet lovely girl has walked by my side all through life and that i have been able he stopped suddenly and i glanced round at him in surprise he was shaking all over in every fibre of his great body his hands were at the and his feet on the gravel i saw what it was he was trying to rise but was so excited that he could not i half extended my hand but a higher courtesy constrained me to draw it back again and turn my round the red lamp face to the sea an instant afterwards he was np and hurrying down the path a woman was coming towards us she was quite close before he had seen her  thirty yards at the	edith-wharton

any more than he believed to be true but it is very easy for a prejudiced person to believe a great deal against one who has offended him a who was not fond of greek could not he a very noble or even a very upright one and he was confident that i paul s true character became known when he was no longer stimulated to great deeds by his high office he would prove to be a very different person from what he now appeared to be mr a half of the paper and several french exercises written by captain to be used as evidence against him he then searched the vessel for similar paper in tho possession of other students but found none he went on deck to ascertain what was to be done for mr had assured him he would not he any longer obliged to sail in the same vessel with the student a boat from the ship was alongside and mr had just stepped on board the was his baggage out of the boat which indicated that he was to remain paul was reading an order just handed to him by mr which appeared to settle the difficulty between him and the learned professor the order was in these words  mr james e is appointed of the academy and will be obeyed and respected accordingly mr is also instructed temporarily c to discharge the duties of professor of greek latin and on board of the r principal the new vice principal handed a note to mr as he came upon deck in which he was directed to repair with his baggage on board of the ship the learned gentleman was not quite satisfied with this arrangement it looked a little ominous have you no order for captain mr he asked as the vice principal waited for him to read his letter i have given him an order from the principal is he not directed to go op board of the ship he is not i have preferred charges against him and i led to believe that he would be suspended added mr who was not quite sure that he was not to be suspended himself no order to that effect was sent by me replied mr you will excuse me but the vessel is about to get under weigh i am not satisfied with these proceedings i complained to mr that it was impossible for me to instruct my classes while they were under the influence of captain no notice appears to have been taken of my charges i think some notice has been taken of them you are directed to report to the principal with baggage on board of the ship am i to be instead of that obstinate and impudent pupil demanded tlie professor i y young l f holland and i have nothing to say about it mr added mr sharply if you are not going to the ship we will weigh anchor and proceed ou our voyage tlie professor went down into his state room and hastily packed his which was brought up and put in the boat by one of the the students watched these movements with the deepest interest and they hardly conceal their satisfaction when it was clear that the was going to leave the bag and baggage there was a gi eat deal of each other in the ribs a great deal of half suppressed and a very decided to give three cheers a few of the more pi ones checked any noisy but the moment that mr went over the side a very joyous one the tripped her anchor and by the steam stood down the river on her way to mr went below and in the state room by professor mr gave the vice principal a hearty welcome and it was soon evident that they were men who could cordially agree paul was delighted with the change for if there was any one in the besides the principal and the doctor for whom he had a high regard and a thorough respect it was mr he was a sailor from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head he had visited all the

author s tion in extent anyway an actor or a great preacher becomes only a name after his death but the who a cathedral or a fine public building really a monument to his own memory he does if he can build it so that it will stay up said the i think you however are better off as you are if you had a more extended reputation or a lasting name you would probably be locked up in some retreat or if you were not posterity would want to know why i am locked up in a retreat of nature s making said the idiot with a sigh nature has set around me certain which while they are not material might as well be so as far as my ability to above them is concerned  and it s well she has if it were otherwise my life would not be safe or in this company as it is i am happy and not at all afraid of the effects your jealousy of me might if i were any better than the rest of you i like that said mr i thought you would said the idiot that s why i said it i aim to please and for once seem to have hit the bull s eye mary kindly break open this for me have you ideas on the subject of architecture that you so desire to become an mr who was always full of sympathy for natures a few said the idiot mr laughed outright let s test his ideas he said in an amused way take a cathedral for instance pose mr idiot a man should come to you and say idiot we have a fund of in our hands actual cash we think of building a cathedral and we think of you to draw up our j give us some idea of what we should do do you mean to tell me that you could say anything reasonable or intelligent to that man well that depends upon what you call reasonable and intelligent i have never been able to find out what you mean by those terms the idiot answered slowly but i could tell him something that i consider reasonable and intelligent from your own point of view then as to and intelligence what should you say to him i d make him out a plan providing for the of his in five per cent gold bonds which would bring him in an income of a year after which i should call his attention to the fact that a year would enable him to take poor children out of this city into the country to and drink fresh milk and eat wholesome food for two weeks every summer from now until the end of time which would build up a human structure that might be of more benefit to the world than any pile of bricks marble and wrought iron or any other could conceive of said the idiot the structure would stand up too you call that architecture do you said mr yes said the idiot of the order but that of course you term  and maybe it is i like to be that kind of an idiot i do not claim to be able to build a cathedral however i don t suppose i could even build a boarding house like this but what i should like to do in architecture would be to put up a for that s a thing that has never been done and i think i might be able to do it if i did i d patent the plan and make a fortune then i should like to know enough about the science of planning a building to find out whether my model hotel is practicable or not you have a model hotel in your mind eh said the it must be a very small hotel if it s in his mind said the doctor that s to saying that it isn t anywhere said mr well it s a great hotel just the same said the idiot although i presume it would be expensive to build it would have rooms in the first place each room would be constructed like an with at hand for moving it up and down the great thing about this would be that persons could have a room on any floor they wanted it so long as they got the room in the beginning a second advantage would lie in the fact that if you were sleeping in a room next door to another in which there was a crying baby you could pull the rope and go up two or three flights until you were free from the noise then in case of fire the room in which the fire started could be lowered into a sliding large enough to the whole thing in which i should have constructed in the cellar if the whole building were to catch fire there would be no loss of life because all the rooms could be lowered to the ground floor and the occupants could step right out upon solid ground then again if you were down on the ground floor and desired to get an extended view of the surrounding country it would be easy to raise your room to the desired elevation why there s no end to the advantages to be gained from such an arrangement it s a fine idea said mr and one worthy of your intellect it couldn t possibly cost more than a million of dollars to erect such a hotel could it said the idiot and that is cheap alongside some of the hotels they are putting up nowadays it could be built on less than four hundred acres of ground too i presume said the with a wink at the doctor certainly said the idiot meekly and if anybody fell sick in	catharine-maria-sedgwick

my heart for that june aunt has now a theme exactly to her taste in the growing extravagance of george s wife mrs has certainly her style of dress a good deal a thing which is the more noticeable from the fact that in we are on the whole so little given to gorgeous i remember that when i called i thought her rather to day aunt talked for half an hour with the greatest apparent enjoyment about the fine gowns and expensive with which the bride is astonishing the town i am afraid it does not take much to set us talking i tried half a dozen times to day to change the subject but my efforts were wasted aunt was not to be diverted from a theme so congenial i reminded her that any bride was expected to display her finery  this is part of the established formality with which marriage is attended that s all very well she retorted with a folks want to see the wedding this is finery george has had to pay for himself i don t see how anybody can know that i told her and i added that it did not seem to me to be the town s business if it were true she tells everybody he gave her the aunt responded and the dresses she s had made since she was married she had n t anything herself the say she was real poor the marriage was so sudden i said that very likely she had n t time to get her wedding at the of a saint any rate aunt i don t see what you and i have to do with her clothes the dear old gossip went on her foot and smiling with evident delight it s the business of the neighbors that she s sure to ruin her husband if she keeps on with her extravagance isn t it besides she wears her clothes to have them talked about she talks about them herself a few dresses won t ruin her husband i protested she has one hired girl now and she s talking of a second aunt went on did you ever hear of such foolishness i reminded her that i had two maids myself oh you she returned that s different i hope you don t put her on a level with real folks do you i tried to treat the whole matter as if it were of no consequence and i did stop the talk here but secretly i am troubled george has very little aside from what he in his profession and he might easily run behind if his wife is really extravagant he needs a woman to help him save june delighted the family to day by her wonderful in following with her eyes the flight of a blue bottle fly that about the nursery such intelligence in one so young is held by us women to the most extraordinary promise i communicated the important event to mr who came to call and he could neither take it gravely nor laugh at the absurdity of our noticing so slight a thing he seemed to be trying to june find out how i wished him to look at it and as i was divided between laughter and secret pride in baby he could not get a sure clue how dull the man is but no doubt he is good when piety and stupidity are united it is unfortunate that they should be made prominent by being set high in spiritual places june i have a good deal of sympathy with s question when he asked the lord if he were his brother s keeper of course his crime turned the question in his case into a mere pitiful excuse but was at least clever enough to take advantage of a principle which must appeal to everybody we cannot be responsible for others when we have neither authority nor control over them it is one of the hardest forms of duty it seems to me when we feel that we ought to do our best yet are practically sure that in the end we can effect little or nothing what can i do to influence george s wife somehow we seem to have no common ground to meet on father used to say that people who do not speak the same language cannot communicate moral ideas to each other this is rather a high sounding way of saying that mrs and i cannot understand each other when anything of real importance comes up it is of course as much my fault as hers but i really do not know how to help or change it i suppose there is a certain and self in my feeling that i could direct her but i am certainly older and i believe i am wiser yet i am not her keeper and if to feel that i am not me in the cowardice of i cannot help it i am ready to do anything i can do but what is there the of a saint june still it is george s wife i dare say a good deal of talk has been and i have not heard it i have been so occupied with graver matters ever since george was married that i have seen few people and have paid little heed to the village talk to day old lady said her say she began by reminding me of the conversation we had had in regard to calling on the bride i am glad we did it she went on it puts us in the right whatever happens but she will not do i shall never ask her to my house i could say nothing i knew she was right but i was so sorry for george she is vulgar the sweet old voice went on she called a second time on me yesterday and	charles-dickens

thunder rattled and the flashed with blinding glare take in sails and said captain haven to the officer of the deck now satisfied that his reputation for carrying sail could not suffer in the face of such indications mr called on the entire watch to obey his for only a quarter watch was required to handle the ship under ordinary circumstances the other portion of the watch being on deck the light sails were taken in and mr made no comment as he sometimes did after an had been performed in order to express his approval or otherwise of the action of the captain the was most strangely deficient in caution on the present occasion and tlie principal was evidently much disturbed by the conduct of her captain who was usually very prudent without being timid there she was with all her extra set and flapping in the calm while a tempest was before her captain must be asleep said mr low in holland and i nervously to peaks the of the and the officers too replied the old salt up his trousers we ought to fire a gun to wake them tip it is not like captain to be caught when a is added the principal i should think the thunder would wake them up it s heavy for these parts that will come all at once when it does come it will take their sails right out of the ropes mr walked aft again and on the met flag officer who had also been tlie and wondering at her continued neglect of the most ordinary precautions mr said the commander of the the ever ready to do the meagre duties assigned to him touched his cap to captain pass the word for the signal officer added the flag officer that s right captain exclaimed the principal if the officers of the don t do better than this they must be broken i am so am i sir captain is usually very careful and what he don t see isn t worth seeing be as as possible for tlie will soon be upon us the signal officer appeared with the and in charge of the captain ordered the number in sail to be set l and ok paul was severely on board of the ship but before he has suffered too much in the estimation of his friends let our readers be transferred to the of the in which as the of the academy ship the same rules and prevailed the port watch were at their studies while the watch had the deck in chaise of mr the first lieutenant this was the captain s study time for he was a member of tlie several classes and in school hours was subject to the discipline of the professors the same as other students when the began to gather professor was hearing the in greek the learned gentleman did not think a scholar knew anything unless he possessed a considerable knowledge of greek it was his favorite branch and the class in this language was his pet he was a strict and never allowed anything to the in greek if he could possibly avoid it no scholar not even the captain as the then were could leave the class without his permission it is true the rule had not been made or even been considered with special reference to the commander of the vessel but paul had always quietly submitted to it even at some inconvenience and sacrifice to himself no emergency had arisen since the went into commission which required the setting aside of the rule and it was supposed the professors would have judgment enough to use it with proper discretion professor so far as greek roots were concerned was not lacking in judgment but he knew no holland and more about a than the did about greek he was a very learned man and lived in a greek and latin atmosphere the dead languages were the chief end of man to him he was cold stern and precise except that when hearing a class in greek he warmed up a little and became more human especially if the students manifested a becoming interest in his favorite branch unfortunately for paul he was not an enthusiastic of the greek language and literature he lived too much in the present to be of anything so old and as it seemed to him so comparatively useless but he was faithful in the discharge of ail the of the institution not excepting even those branches which he disliked though he was always very respectful to professor he was candid enough to say that he did not like greek he was therefore no favorite of tlie learned gentleman who thought his abilities and his were over estimated  because he did not like the dead languages mr ine to inform you that a is coming up said the third master as i touched liis cap to captain no interruption no interruption interposed professor very ill the third master his cap as the captain bowed to him in acknowledgment that he had heard the message and then retired the professor was vexed perhaps he was a little more ill natured than usual on account of being slightly  an effect produced by the uneasy roll of the vessel in the calm l and or now mr go on

was cut and his temples bruised with some blunt instrument the murder had been traced to his servant and was to be in kind this very morning italian were not cruel in general but this murder was thought to call for exact and bloody the criminal was brought to the house of the murdered man and fastened for half an hour to its wall after this of legal vengeance his hand was struck like his

about this room his would go in that corner very well and his writing desk in this one the bed of course would go there and the there he did not think at all of the gain to this widow from letting her room to him it is one of the pleasures of telling a true story that you do not have to superior virtues to your characters was a selfish young man he did not see why he should make a change in his room merely to oblige another person unless it was in some way to his own advantage he would remain where he was contact with the business world had taught him that all matters it fa dollars and cents must be considered from a sordid the room is all right he said finally just as the widow was about to speak again i have no doubt you can let it at that price to some one if it were nearer the i would say at once that i would take it all that makes me hesitate is the long walk to breakfast mrs was for an instant at this statement she had thought him gifted with a little finer sense of the delicacy of her situation he evidently considered the of this room from the same that he would have bought a cargo of butter or a of hay but her strong head controlled her and the engaging smile never left her countenance more young men there might be but certainly this one would have a shrewd eye to the necessities of life and if secured him for a husband she would not be left in want some day on account of his extravagance the more she thought it over the better pleased she was at his i can arrange that for you i am sure she said sweetly i will have your breakfast at any hour you name served in my own dining room as to the price for she readily guessed that this matter would have its weight with him you shall fix that to suit yourself after so long at it may be a pleasant change to sit at the table of a private house even though the variety is not quite as great the variety it struck him for the first time that there had not been much variety of late at the place where he took his meals he cared little for the luxuries of the table but he recalled with no ray fo fa tt s ma warm sentiments the everlasting that he had only varied by eggs eggs eggs and the not over dignified by some strange with the name of coffee he pictured to himself a dining room with a table cloth that was sure to be clean and an atmosphere that would at least not be smoky or filled with flies i rise very early he answered i am always down by seven o clock the lady smiled your breakfast shall never keep you waiting a minute after that hour said she then we will call it settled i will take the house beginning from the first of the month and in a fortnight from to day we shall find ourselves settled here was too good a man to be caught in this way had he not concluded that it was for his interest to make the change he had no associates in his present lodging house that he cared much about his habits were retiring as has already been stated he was confident that mrs would make a and obliging landlady he replied accordingly that he would accompany her to the agent of the property to close the agreement and in a few minutes they were at the office of that the agent had a momentary look of surprise when volunteered to be for the payment of the rent for the first three months mrs being a stranger in the place he knew the young man very well and had the opinion of him that was current he had never heard him speak of relations and wondered what there might be in this new development of interest in a rather good looking widow even though she was considerably his elder but business young s el was business with him and he said mr s word was fully sufficient and that he should consider the house the parlor of the spider could not have looked more attractive to the little fly than s chamber did to him when he next beheld it mrs was one of the best in the world a perfect of taste and neatness her furniture was much better than that at his old lodging but this was not half the change there was an air of brightness about the room that he had never known in any other since the days of childhood the lace curtains were surmounted by white fringed with gold behind the was a worked in red with a representation of a scene on the were as fresh and clean as could be over the white of the bed was spread a lace covering to match the which though of an kind seemed to the inexperienced eyes of the young man too fine for every day use there were on the floor of cheerful colors and a basket to receive the litter from his desk was tied with cherry ribbon the of the walls was relieved by pictures in every possible place and worked hung over the doors he sat down quite overcome with all these glories and congratulated himself at obtaining them without extra cost except for moving his few personal from mrs s it takes very little to make a room cheerful and yet how few women are real of the art how few understand that there is nothing so cheerful as light how few realize that things the most costly are not always the most attractive there	arthur-conan-doyle

stands revealed this is what the gods made him for of fancies rainbow colored dreams away from the of life through which life s pathos and humor and tenderness should delicately play had the word with us americans not been out of all critical meaning should be called a its light completely from a form complete attained this through newspaper work and side work of verses and fantastic for the newspaper made him master of his instead of being mastered by it and set free his fancy from s from the of from paris streets as knew them he brought fancies and more fancies verse and prose ever finer tempered  the shining even brighter through the language it is wholesome knowledge that he was a civilized college bred american dwelling quiet at home that cultivation made valuable his gift

prospect did not weigh upon the mind of the worthy magistrate who busied himself only with his duty and accepted that duty in whatever form it was arrested and brought before him so to speak by the but the thought of a long and was an but refreshing to another of the court  the  clerk paul half asleep and nodding was paul as he sat and waited for the hour of opening court his head ached and the of the still rang in liis ears he had been out very late himself  oh very late  and this morning his dearly despised official duties seemed like the vast court room more forbidding and gloomy than ever now when a young man finds his office gloomy in the morning and his duties irksome that generally means that he a soul above routine and the night before only his and as a matter of fact paul deemed that in being made a clerk he had arrived at the wrong address like most other young he thought he had been directed a la and he wished to be instead of a clerk in the court a poet a and most particularly a writer of  that should make all paris laugh and sing and dance that should go round the world like the or the de madame that should bring him fame and money and the friendship of the

appetite can never be controlled as it it grows and grows it begins in the gallery and by degrees to the stall sometimes it may even conquer the green room and the but thus to feed is the bitterest vanity if the ideas will not arrive and that was the difficulty with paul ideas cut him dead except when he was asleep for when he was asleep and  dreaming the most striking plots revealed themselves to him by thomas whole performed themselves before him as author and sole spectator only when he awoke he could not remember a single situation it was a new demonstration of fate s and subtle irony that poor paul should nightly renew the bitterness of his own conviction that he deserved success and daily himself against his own unlucky memory as being to blame for his inability to command it yes when he slept he saw all kinds of plays with characters and motives plots and stories drawn from every age and heroes more romantic than bias more comic than theatrical surprises more thrilling than the horn in more clever than the scented glove in and as for stage pictures he had but to close his eyes and they crowded on his sight magnificent in their complex accuracy and perfection yet what

nephew made little galloped into the affections of the old man with as much facility as she galloped about the roads in the neighborhood on a pony that he very soon bought for her she even filled a in his heart which the boy had never quite succeeded in doing he found the greatest delight in her society and thought nothing finer than to take her little hand in his and stroll through the grounds or down to the village or over to the works gossip that plant which in all seasons and at all times took up the subject and many were the observations and regarding the strange fancy of the man for the child of his housekeeper as he never heard any of these things however they did not trouble him his servants with indignation the which came to their ears declaring that the master s life raised him above criticism having nothing to feed on the soon subsided the housekeeper s daughter mr met his nephew at new york and welcomed him cordially though with rather less than the latter expected when they spoke of mr suggested that the young man would probably find much better at the hotel than at the family mansion i live like a sort of he explained taking my meals at random and i m afraid it would be dull for you when you get ready to come up i will arrange with mr to give you the best rooms he has and i can meet you every day at the counting room so far from being disagreeable to this plan entirely met his views he felt that it would be necessary to pass considerable time at for the looks of the thing and he regarded the whole affair as a species of penance from which there was no means of escape he had grown a great deal older in the past three years he dreaded the air of his uncle s house and at the prospect of bed at nine and breakfast at six which he recalled as the rule of former days life at the hotel though it must be dreary enough would not involve these he could come and go when he pleased with no one to interfere he felt certain that mr would not spend much time in attending to things which were none of his business he accordingly responded to his uncle s evident satisfaction that he would be content with any arrangements that were made for him love at seventy you have your letter of credit on s still of course remarked the elder gentleman oh yes i believe it is not limited in amount no sir i hope i have not drawn more than you thought proper by no means was the reply i left it altogether with i wanted you to have enough how long do you mean to stay in was surprised at the question and wished he knew how best to answer it he stole a glance at his uncle in hopes to find some guide in his expression but that gentleman was looking at the carpet i do not know exactly he replied at last have you any suggestions he asked desperately n o said mr and here the conversation changed to other subjects and the matter was not taken up again had never mentioned in any of his letters to that he had changed the man knew nothing of the child who had gone so far toward taking his place in his uncle s house and heart he must know it at some time but the one most interested wanted to the day as late as possible why should not everything have been revealed at once what reason was there for this secrecy so foreign to everything else in the old man s character was now an experienced man was seventeen quite a woman perhaps that had something to do with it miss is shocked chapter v miss is shocked s recollections of the character of mr who ran the hotel at were entirely correct the house over which he presided like almost everything else in was owned by as was the favorite relation and probable heir of his uncle was glad to see him and had no idea of letting anything interfere with his contentment the day before his arrival the landlord spoke to each of the in turn bidding them make every effort to please the young gentleman who was to come he has travelled a great deal he said and may appear unreasonable in some things but there is to be just one rule for him whatever he asks for he must have to this mr added a mild hint that it would be very disastrous for any particular servant with whom mr came in collision and an air of not to say awe the entire household as the critical day drew near the number of was naturally small as the establishment seldom had a dozen transient guests at one time there was a female cook who never came into any portion of the house where the guests would be likely to encounter her but who played a love at seventy most important part for all that in the economy of the concern there was a middle aged woman who in the double capacity of chief and head table a maid a boy who did odd and one or two men whose duties were mainly at the stable to this had recently been added the pretty girl whom met on his way from the counting room on the morning when he first saw young she was under general instructions to be ready for any emergency and never having had the least experience in a hotel was considerably

of it although things seem to go easily enough the responsibility of taking charge of a helpless life me and i do not dare to let my thoughts go when they begin to picture possibilities in the future i wonder that i ever dared to undertake to have baby and yet her surroundings will be so much better here than with the dreadful grandmother that she must surely be better for them in any case i had to help tom i proposed a permanent nurse for baby but and took up arms at once and all but me with having cast doubts on their ability and surely we three women among us should be able to take care of one morsel although none of us ever had babies of our own april nothing could be more absurd than the way in which the entire household now about baby all of us are completely slaves already although the way in which we show it is naturally different has surrendered frankly and without she and at the idea of having the child of that creature in the house she did not venture to say this to me april directly of course but she relieved her mind by making remarks to when i could not help hearing from the moment baby came however without a struggle it is evident she is born with the full maternal instinct and i see if she does not marry her or some more eligible lover and take herself away before baby is old enough to be much affected the child will be spoiled to an unlimited extent as for her method of showing her affection is to exhibit the greatest solicitude for baby s spiritual welfare mingled with the keenest jealousy of s claims on baby s love i foresee that i shall have pretty hard work to protect my little daughter from s well meant but not very wise and how to do this without the good old soul s feelings may prove no easy problem as for myself  of course i love the little helpless pink thing the from some outside unknown brought here into a world where everything is made so hard to her from the start she woke this afternoon and looked up at me with tom s eyes lying there as sweet and happy as possible so that i had to kiss and her and love her all at once it is wonderful how a baby comes out of the most dreadful surroundings as a comes out of the mud so clean and fresh i said this to aunt yesterday and she yes she answered but a weed grows into a weed no matter how it looks when it is little the thought is dreadful to me i will not believe that because a human being is born out of weakness and wickedness there is no chance for it the difference it seems to me is that every human being has the of a saint at least the of good as well as of bad and one may be developed as well as the other baby must have much that is good and fine from her father and the thing i have to do is to see to it that the best of her grows and the worse part dies for want of nourishment surely we can do a great deal to aid ture perhaps my baby cannot help herself much at least not for years and years but if she is kept in an atmosphere which is completely wholesome whatever is best in her nature must grow strong and crowd down everything less noble may may baby is more every day she is so wonderful and so lovely that i am never tired of watching her the miracle of a baby s growth makes one stand speechless in delight and awe when this little morsel of life hardly as many days in the world as i have been years and smiles and stretches out those tiny fingers only big enough for a fairy i feel like going down on my knees to the mystery of life i do not wonder that people pray i understand entirely the impulse to cry out to something mighty something higher than our own strength some heart of nature somewhere the desire to find by leaning on the invisible a relief from the of the emotions we all must feel when a sense of the greatness of life takes hold on us if it were but possible to believe in any of the many gods that have been offered to us how glad i should be father used to say that every human being really makes a deity for himself and that the difference between and is whether they can allow the church to give a name to the god a man has himself created i cannot accept any name from authority but the sense of some brooding power is very strong in me when i see this being growing as if out of nothing in my very hands when i look at baby i have so great a conscious the op a saint ness of the life outside of us the life of the universe as a whole that i am ready to agree with any one who talks of god the trouble is that one idea of deity seems to me as true and also as inadequate as all the rest so that in the end i am left with only my overwhelming sense of the of the mystery of existence and of the unity of all the life in the universe may to day we named baby i would not do it without consulting her father so i sent for tom and he came over just after breakfast the day has been warm and the windows were open a soft breath of wind came in with a feeling of spring in it	charles-dickens
realized what they meant a great shadow seemed to pass from my soul i did not know how this treasure had weighed me down until the sign of four now that it was finally removed it was selfish no doubt wrong but i could realize nothing save that the golden barrier was gone from between us thank god i ejaculated from my very heart she looked at me with a quick questioning smile why do you say that she asked because you are within my reach again i said taking her hand she did not withdraw it because i love you mary as truly as ever a man loved a woman because this treasure these riches sealed my lips now that they are gone i can tell you how i love you that is why i said thank god then i say thank god too she whispered as i drew her to my side whoever had lost a treasure i knew that night that i had gained one chapter xii the strange story of small a very patient man was that in the cab for it was a weary time before i rejoined him his face clouded over when i showed him the empty box there goes the reward said he gloomily where there is no money there is no pay this night s work would have been worth a each to sam brown and me if the treasure had been there mr is a rich man i said he will see that you are rewarded treasure or no the shook his head however the sign of four it s a bad job he repeated and so mr jones will think his proved to be correct for the looked blank enough when i got to baker street and showed him the empty box they had only just arrived the prisoner and he for they had changed their plans so far as to report themselves at a station upon the way my companion in his arm chair with his usual expression while small sat opposite to him with his wooden leg cocked over his sound one as i exhibited the empty box he leaned back in his chair and laughed aloud this is your doing small said jones angrily yes i have put it away where you shall never lay hand upon it he cried it is my treasure and if i can t have the i ll take good care that no one strange story of small else does i tell you that no living man has any right to it unless it is three men who are in the and myself i know now that i cannot have the use of it and i know that they cannot i have acted all through for them as much as for myself it s been the sign of four with us always well i know that they would have had me do just what i have done and throw the treasure into the thames rather than let it go to or kin of or it was not to make them rich that we did for you ll find the treasure where the key is and where little is when i saw that your must catch us i put the away in a safe place there are no for you this journey you are deceiving us small said jones sternly if you had wished to throw the treasure into the thames it would j the sign of four have been easier for you to have thrown box and all easier for me to throw and easier for you to recover he answered with a shrewd look the man that was clever enough to hunt me down is clever enough to pick an iron box from the bottom of a river now that they are scattered over five miles or so it may be a harder job it went to my heart to do it though i was half mad when you came up with us however there s no good over it had in my life and ive had downs but i ve learned not to cry over milk this is a very serious matter small said the if you had helped justice instead of it in this way you would have had a better chance at your trial justice r the ex a pretty justice whose is this if it is not ours where is the justice that i should strange story of small give it up to those who have never earned it look how i have earned it twenty long years in that fever ridden swamp all day at work under the tree all night chained up in the filthy huts bitten by with by every cursed black faced policeman who loved to take it out of a white man that was how i earned the treasure and you talk to me of justice because i cannot bear to feel that i have paid this price only that another may enjoy it i would rather swing a score of times or have one of s in my hide than live in a s cell and feel that another man is at his ease in a palace with the money that should be mine small had dropped his mask of and all this came out in a wild whirl of words while his eyes blazed and the together with the impassioned movement of his hands i could understand as i the sign of four saw the fury and the passion of the man that it was no or unnatural terror which had possessed major when he first learned that the injured was upon his track you forget that we know nothing of all this said quietly we have not heard your story and we cannot tell how far justice may originally have been on your side well sir you have been very fair spoken to me though i can see	edith-wharton
the same fate which has already befallen louis in the outrage of the th so far i had got when my heart sprang suddenly into my mouth and the paper fluttered down from my fingers a grip of iron had closed suddenly round each of my ankles and there in the of the fire i saw two hands which even in that terrified glance i perceived to be covered with black hair and of an enormous size so my friend cried a thundering voice this time at least we have been too many for you by ic iv men of the i had little time given me to the extraordinary and humiliating position in which i found myself for i was lifted up by my ankles as if i were a fowl pulled a perch and jerked roughly down into the room my back striking upon the stone floor with a which shook the breath from my body don t kill him yet said a soft voice let us make sure who he is first i felt the pressure of a thumb upon my chin and of fingers upon my throat and my head was slowly forced round until the strain became quarter of an inch does it and no mark said the voice you can trust my old turn don t don t said the same gentle voice which had spoken first i saw you do it once by uncle before and the horrible that it made haunted me for a long time to think that the sacred flame of life can be so readily out by that great material finger and thumb mind can indeed conquer matter but the fighting must not be at close quarters my neck was so twisted that i could not see any of these people who were discussing my fate i could only lie and listen the fact remains my dear charles that the fellow has our all important secret and that it is our lives or his i recognised in the voice which was now speaking that of the man of the cottage we owe it to ourselves to put it out of his power to harm us let him sit up for there is no possibility of his escaping some irresistible force at the back of my neck dragged me instantly into a sitting position and so for the first time i was able to look round me in a dazed fashion and to see these men into whose hands i had fallen that they were in the past and had plans for the future i already gathered from what i had heard and seen i understood also that in the heart of that lonely by men of the night marsh i was absolutely in their power none the less i remembered the name that i bore and i concealed as far as i could the sickening terror which lay at my heart there were three of them in the room my former acquaintance and two new comers stood by the table with his fat brown book in his hand looking at me with a composed face but with that humorous questioning twinkle in his eyes which a master player might assume when he had left his opponent without a move on the top of the box beside him sat a very faced yellow hollow eyed man of fifty with lips and a skin which hung loosely over the long under his prominent chin he was dressed in snuff coloured clothes and his legs under his knee breeches were of a ludicrous he shook his head at me with an air of sad wisdom and i could read little comfort in his grey eyes but it was the man called who alarmed me most he was a rather than tall but from his excess of muscle his huge legs were crooked like those of a great and indeed there was by ic uncle something animal about his whole appearance for he was bearded up to his eyes and it was a rather than a hand which still clutched me by the collar as to his expression he was too with hair to show one but his large black eyes looked with a sinister questioning from me to the others if they were the judge and jury it was clear who was to be whence did he come what is his business how came he to know the hiding place asked the thin man when he first came i him for you in the darkness answered you will acknowledge that it was not a night on which one would expect to meet many people in the on discovering my mistake i shut the door and concealed the papers in the chimney i had forgotten that he might see me do this crack by the hinges but when i went out again to show him his way and so get rid of him my eye caught the gap and i at once that he had seen my action and that it must have aroused his curiosity to such an extent that it would be quite certain that he would think and speak of it i by by by ic men of tiie night called him back into the hut therefore in order that i might have time to consider what i had best do with him a couple of cuts of that wood axe and a bed in the corner of the marsh would have settled the business at once said the fellow by my side quite true my good but it is not usual to lead off with your ace of a a little let us hear what you did then it was my first object to learn whether this man what did you say his name was cried the thin man his name according to his account is my first object then was to find out whether he had in truth	edith-wharton

cross thirteen dark and finally descend through m s upon this the of the mountains it was a weird ride i got on very slowly the road is a hard one for any horse specially for a heavily loaded one and at the end of several weeks the mountains of severe travel when i had ridden fifteen miles stopped at the where people usually get food but it was empty and the next was also deserted so i was compelled to go to the last house where two young men are there i had to decide between getting a meal for myself or a feed for the pony but the young man on hearing of my sore poverty trusted me till next time his house for order and neatness and a sort of of cleanliness  the comfort of cleanliness without its severity  is a pattern to all women while the clear eyes and manly self respect which the habit of total gives in this country are a pattern to all men he cooked me a splendid dinner with good tea after dinner i opened the mail bag and was delighted to find an of letters from you but i sat much too long there forgetting that i had twenty miles to ride which could hardly be done in less than six hours it was then brilliant i had not the magnificence of that ride when i took it before but the pony was tired and i could not hurry her and the distance seemed interminable as after every range i crossed another range then came a region of deep dark wooded only a few feet wide and many and from their cold depths i saw the last sunlight fade from the brows of feet high it was as darkness came on to wind in and out in the pine a lady s life in xiii gloom sometimes on ice sometimes in snow at the bottom of these tremendous wolves howled in all directions this is said to the approach of a storm during this ride i met a hunter with an packed on his horse and he told me not only that the were at the cabin yesterday but that they were going to remain for two weeks longer no matter how the ride did seem endless after darkness came on finally the last huge range was conquered the last deep chasm passed and with an which for human companionship i rode up to mountain jim s den but no light shone through the and all was silent so i rode down m s which was fuu of and other strange mountain noises and was pitch dark though the stars were bright overhead soon i heard the welcome sound of a barking dog i supposed it to strange hunters but calling ring at a venture the noble dog s large and grand head were in a moment on my saddle and he greeted me with all those inarticulate but perfectly noises with which dogs welcome their human friends of the two men on horses who accompanied him one was his master as i knew by the musical voice and grace of manner but it was too dark to see any one though he struck a light to show me the valuable with which one of the horses xiii the mountains was loaded the was heartily glad to see me and sending the man and fur laden horse on to his cabin he turned with me to s and as the cold was very severe and was very tired we dismounted and walked the remaining three miles au my visions of a comfortable reception and good meal after my long ride vanished with his first words the had left for the winter on the previous morning but had not passed through the cabin was the stores were low and two young men mr a and mr whom i was slightly acquainted with before were there to look after the stock until who was daily expected returned the other and his wife had left the park so there was not a woman within twenty five miles a fierce wind had arisen and the cold was awful which seemed to make matters darker i did not care in the least about myself i could rough it and enjoy doing so but i was very sorry for the young men who i knew would be much embarrassed by the sudden appearance of a lady for an indefinite time but the difficulty had to be faced and i walked in and took them by surprise as they were sitting smoking by the fire in the living room which was and wretched looking the young men did not show

you can doubt the identity of these people she glanced at them and then looked up at us with the set rigid face of a desperate woman mr she said this man had offered me marriage on condition that i could get a divorce from my husband he has lied to me the in every conceivable way not one word of truth has he ever told me and why  why i imagined that all was for my own sake but now i see that i was never anything but a tool in his hands why should i e faith with him who never kept any with me why should i try to shield him from the consequences of his own wicked acts ask me what you and there is nothing which i shall hold back one thing i swear to you and that is that when i wrote the letter i never dreamed of any harm to the old gentleman who had been my kindest friend i entirely believe you madam said the recital of these events must be very painful to you and perhaps it will make it easier if i tell you what occurred and you can check me if i make any material mistake the sending of this letter was suggested to you by he dictated it i i presume that the reason he gave was that the hound of the b ask e r v i i l et would receive help from sir charles for the legal expenses connected with your divorce exactly and then after you had sent the letter he you from keeping the appointment he told me that it would hurt his self respect that any other man should find the money for such an object and that though he was a poor man self he would devote his last penny to removing the obstacles which divided us he appears to be a very consistent character and then you heard nothing until you read the re ports of the death in the paper no and he made you swear to say nothing about your appointment with sir charles he did he said that the death was a very mysterious one and that i should certainly be if the facts came out he frightened me into remaining silent quite so but you had your suspicions she hesitated and looked down i knew him she said but if he had kept faith with me i should always have done so with him i think that on the whole you have had a fortunate escape said you have had him in your power and he knew it and yet you are alive you have been walking for some months very near to the edge of a precipice we must ai fixing the j good r mrs and it i  shortly r probable that you will v again our case becomes rounded off and difficulty after difficulty away in front of us said as we stood waiting for the arrival of the express from town i shall soon be in the position of being able to put into a single connected narrative one of the most singular and crimes of modern times students of will remember the incidents in in little russia in the year and of course there are the in north but this case possesses some features which are entirely its own even now we have no clear case against this man but i shall be very much surprised if it is not clear enough before we go to bed this night the london express came roaring into the station and a small of a man had sprung from a first class carriage we all three shook hands and i saw at once from the way which gazed at my companion that he id learned a good deal since the days when they id first worked together i could well remember the scorn which the theories of the used then to excite in the practical man anything good he asked the biggest thing for years said we have two hours before we need think of start the hound of the ing i think we might employ it in gi dinner and then we will take fog out of your throat by giving you the pure night air of never ah well i don t suppose you will the hound of the one of s defects  if indeed one may call it a defect  was that he was exceedingly loth to communicate his full plans to any other person until the instant of their fulfilment partly it came no doubt from his own nature which loved to and surprise those who were around him partly also from his professional caution which urged him never to take any chances the result however was very trying for those who were acting as his agents and i had often suffered under it but never more so than during that long drive in the darkness the great ordeal was in front of us at last we were about to make our final effort and yet had said nothing and i could only what his course of action would be my nerves thrilled with anticipation when at last the cold wind upon our faces and the dark void spaces on either side of the narrow road told me that w were back upon the once again every of the horses and every turn of the wheels was taking us nearer to our supreme adventure our conversation was by the presence rf the driver of the hired so that we were the bound of the forced lo talk of trivial matters were tense with emotion and relief to me after that unnatural at last passed s house and i were drawing near to the hall and to action we did not drive up to the d down near the gate of the avenue tl was paid off	edith-wharton

were filled with a happy company mrs had heen a resident of the town for many years and invitations to her evenings were held in high esteem by for many miles around the people one was likely to meet there were seldom either or lions but were selected with the idea of making a cheerful group capable of pleasure to each other and occasions where the danger of being bored was reduced to a mrs though hardly yet out of the had been long a widow at the moment when our story opens she was standing with her handsome daughter in the centre of an animated circle engaged in conversation though still so young she had an abundance of silvery hair which she had never taken any pains to conceal their marriage bond she was of build with a good color a bright pair of dark eyes and a charming expression of countenance in her dress she was but simple she was not a in the school which throws a young woman back into the of youth merely because she happens to be of her husband neither did she think it to parade her loss on all possible occasions though she felt the blow keenly she had with great between the perpetual black and veil that make one shudder at a certain species of woman and the frivolous actions of another variety which becomes a sort of for the of the rising generation she was possessed of a fair fortune and the estate on which her residence was situated was a beautiful old place many acres which seemed destined with the growth of boston to be very valuable at some time in the future miss the only daughter of the lady then in her nineteenth year was unquestionably the fairest object among the many good looking women present plump without being stout a little above the average in height with a lovely complexion and an abundance of fair hair arranged with exquisite taste she was as pretty a girl as one might find in a long journey she was most and her manners were a happy medium between the ways of the and the airy pretensions that so many of her sex think it best to affect simply charming was the expression of all the men who saw her and the same verdict was wrung unwillingly from the lips of many women whose envious eyes wandered over the beautiful picture oh there s no denying that is pretty their marriage bond ihey would say in despair and i wonder who taught her to dress with such perfection i never saw her when she wasn t a model for a though i don t believe she any more on her clothes than hundreds who can t approach them in effect two young men stood on opposite sides of the room from mrs and her daughter them as closely as was consistent with good breeding between the pauses in the conversation they were having how beautiful is to night said one of them whose name was as if the expression was forced from him in spite of himself to whom the remark was addressed did not take his gaze from the object of its she is on the whole the finest girl of her age i ever saw he responded in a low tone she would be proud to know that you said so replied with a laugh i believe you are considered the best judge in the state feminine beauty according to all accounts is one of your as if he did not like the intended compliment in this connection i wonder on what the base their information he said with a shade of coldness i know well enough that my name gets mixed up in half the in the neighborhood of boston and yet nine times out of ten there s not the faintest excuse for the talk perhaps the reason is that i have a sharp eye and a quick ear nothing me more than an interesting woman who has begun to take the bit in her teeth i like to know

consider me an eccentric individual my married life has hitherto been a sealed book to all my acquaintances i have long felt that it would be a relief if i could speak of it to one as deeply attached

manner so sincere and straightforward as to make impossible students must be held to and simple expression of real and feelings in every class and perhaps especially criticism among are likely to be some who will surely repeat conventional phrases pick up set phrases with surprising ease and will offer them whenever they have reason to believe such will be received instead of real coin these are easily recognized and they should be dealt with anything except that weapon which ia forbidden to the being legitimate against such cant the student who a set phrase is usually effectually disposed of by a request to explain to make clear and to prove so that the habit of repetition cannot grow unless the teacher is to it the genuine ideas of the pupils may be developed and put into word in the class and afterwards the writing oat will involve getting them into order and logical it may be objected that by thia process each scholar will borrow ideas from what he hears said in the class this is in reality no serious to the method if the individuals are trained to think for themselves each will judge the views which are presented in class and make them his own by and them in any case the danger of a student s getting too many ideas is not large and those he gets from his his are much more likely to appeal to him and to remain in hb mind than any which he from books the notions will sometimes be crude but they will be so corrected and discussed in that they cannot be essentially false talks on teaching literature any criticism which ia received from pupils whether spoken or written must first of all be in sound sense la tlie only safe basis w any and the higher the grade of a work of literature the more easy is it to treat it in a common sense spirit pupils  should be made to feel not only that they have a right to any opinion of their own on what they read but that they are expected to have one and that this opinion may be of any nature whatever bo long as they can justify it by sound reasons still farther than this they should be allowed freely to cherish tastes for which they cannot give formal justification  provided they can show a reasonable appreciation of the real qualities of the work they like or dislike in the higher regions imaginative work the power of analysis of the most able critic may fail and it is idle to expect from school children criticism of high things which yet they may feel deeply since it is of so much importance that all comment and criticism shall be sincere care must be taken to keep work within limits which make sincerity possible students must not be required to perform tasks which are in the nature of things impossible to push beyond dealing with comparatively simple matters in a frank and direct manner inevitably to encourage the use of conventional phrases and to replace sincerity with cant a nice question itself with the determination of how much it is proper and wise to re  t a criticism of children it is how much farther it is well to call upon them to literature than we should ask them to on life we need to know wh t we are doing and though an examination of the character and motives of a criminal in a hook is not the same as would be this sort of applied to a flesh and blood neighbor the two processes are the in essence the better the teacher in the imagination of the pupil moreover the more closely the two approach we should be sure that we axe doing well in requiring o the young who would not and should not be encouraged to dwell on actual crime and suffering that they produce original upon these things as represented in action it is of course to be allowed that no teaching can make actions vital and real in exactly the same way as is that which is known actually to have happened an imaginative child the story which touches him but does not bring it home to himself as he would within the circle of his own experience it may be urged that by ng him to sin in the comparatively remote world of fancy we give him a chance to perceive its moral without that distrust of hb fellows which might come if he were forced to the lesson from the of life and that in hooks the knowledge of character and circumstance is so much fuller than it is likely to be in experience that he is able talks on teaching literature to see more clearly the fact remains however that we should hardly expect or desire a and reasonable estimate of the late king and queen of from the school who are being made to write laborious on the motives and the character of and lady that we should be shocked at finding boys and girls considering in real life like the of or suspicions like those entertained of we certainly cannot afford to be or to confine the young to books they may generally be safely trusted it seems to me to read any tale or poem of first merit although its subject e as painful as that of they will receive it as they receive of life told by a wholesome minded person often with y little real perception o the darkest and most sinister side it will be as it was with young when he read s and took delight in the hero a child s tom jones a harmless creature when it comes to the discussion of motives of character of black events in fiction the case is different the child is forced to take a new attitude	charles-dickens

could not resist the temptation to pour in one more hot shot i am afraid you know too much for your own safety young man said with difficulty his emotions too much for your safety you mean for both if that suits your humor better by ic the of a naval officer perhaps i do and i assure you the best thing you can do will be to put me on shore at the earliest possible moment and make your ten thousand

make a reply there was not much however that the amiable gentleman could say for had taken the wind all out of his sails by exhibiting his knowledge of the mysteries he was exceedingly troubled and he could no longer conceal from his prisoner his anxiety and uneasiness he made several efforts more or less direct to ascertain where had obtained his information but the latter was too well satisfied

truth from your vicinity mr remarked in response to these a took ing suggestions that he could tell much better what his friend was about if he would drop mr hesitated he saw no way but to trust this man with the facts and yet he dreaded the possibility that he might prove obstinate by the way lie said as if to change the subject temporarily have you been out to see lately mr shook his head you ought to said he s improved g thousand per cent in the last few weeks his financial luck has made a new man of him i m glad of that responded the other and i m glad too that i ve got my money out of his firm for i had a strong suspicion at one time that he waa running pretty close to the wall mr nodded to show that he believed this statement and then grew sober sometimes when men get into a tight place he said they do queer things supposing i should tell you that mr had and notes in a way he was not to do the stout man opened his eyes wider that would be a piece of news he answered but if he did he s made it all right by this time of course and nobody is the mr drew himself up in his chair as if indignant do you think that is enough he demanded raising his voice by supposing i tell you my name was one of those he with a black the other did not seem much if the paper is all in i wouldn t make a fuss about it if i were you he replied is a good fellow he has gone out of business and i hope he ll never go in again take my advice if you have learned anything to his and keep it to yourself could hardly control himself do you think i intend to let him my name on his notes and and not put him under arrest he cried when the proofs are beyond question mr bowed and said he meant that exactly he further remarked that he was astonished that his friend had any other idea in his mind the family was one in which he had been received and he ought to do everything possible to prevent harm to any of its members as he proceeded in this vein mr grew so earnest that he did not notice the broad smile of happiness that was creeping over the face of his companion and was not prepared to find a pair of manly arms clasped around his neck you you was trying to say you dear kind sensible fellow you ve made me the happiest man on earth of course wouldn t trouble but i was afraid you would he used your name as well as mine the rascal everything is paid up and all the trouble now is that a miserable has got hold of some of the paper and wants to him and what i called you here to day for is to get you to agree with me to like a stuck pig s acknowledge every scrap of that paper as being our own the sudden change was more than mr could bear for a moment he sat to use a common expression like a stuck pig staring at you remember the that worked for explained mr he got hold of some of these notes and in s office and is coming to look us up to day for the purpose of having his employer arrested a nice game eh but we will foil him won t we we ll show him a trick worth several of his he s probably gone to the house and he ll hang round till he finds me i ll send word that i am to be home this afternoon at five you will be there with me we ll tackle him together when he tells us that he has some paper in his possession we ll act astonished and enraged we ll ask him to show it to us and when we ve got it all in our hands we ll say the are our own and kick him down stairs are you with me is it a go old boy the agreement was made without more mr began to see the humorous element in the affair and actually came nearer laughing than he had done since the day he discovered that the of his waist placed him out of the list of eligible when everything was settled mr excused himself for a few moments while he to s door and knocked came to open it and when she saw who the visitor was she blushed a black come in she said i am sure both of us are glad to see you s eyes met those of his friend with a strange expression he knew now that all his suspicions were that had proved himself noble and true but the apologies that he owed could not be made in the presence of a third person and he made no reference to them his changed appearance was enough however for the reconciliation with the girl of his heart was perfect and the happiness that shone from their faces repaid their good friend for his sacrifice i think i ought to take miss to her train now said after the exchange of a few ordinary remarks she can come to see you to morrow again and before many days we will have matters arranged with so that can go out to in his proper capacity oh you need not little woman the love you two have for each other does both of you credit returning to mr for the sake of allowing the young couple a few minutes for their good dismissed that gentleman with the understanding that not later than half past	arthur-conan-doyle

masculine in disdain for personal consequences and faith in the success of their principles one evening was surprised by an unexpected addition to their ranks a mile brought with her an american lady for whom she gave her fullest it was knew it was but he had to admit that she was greatly changed she had now abundant threads of white in her hair and many of those lines that tell of suffering about her mouth and eyes he was not willing to follow the hint that her quick glance gave him and pretend that he did not know her he preferred to say coldly i think i have met miss in america and then he went on with the business of the evening as if nothing had happened the republican government is not likely to make additional trouble for itself by any of us at present he said it has quite enough to do to resist the siege if however we should be placed under arrest it would only hasten the revolt that is in the breasts of our friends the national guards and lead all the quicker to the opening of the gates to the for one i hope the contest will be a prolonged one i want it continued until the temporary masters of france become as to the people as were their imperial our country is eighty years behind the true hour of her destiny except for the unhappy of the first she would have taken her place before the end of the last century we must see to it that she is not controlled by another man on horseback when next we find her bleeding in the dust husband s friend these sentiments were warmly by all present and similar were made in impassioned language by many others both men and women arrangements for carrying on the were made reports were received from various and new life was into the movement it was one of the peculiarities of the french that most of the leaders were men of foreign birth and none of them were more trusted than his labors his marked devotion made him conspicuous even in ranks where such qualities were the common property of all when the meeting broke up miss told her friend mile that she had a little business to with mr and remained after the others had departed but when she found that they were alone she could hardly trust herself to speak the cause promises well she managed to articulate after an embarrassing pause i should answer yes and no to that he replied the test will come when we have to rely on these french to fight the government forces i will say however that i have high hopes you were surprised to see me here yes how did you manage to pass the there is no guard so strong that it can keep a woman from the man she loves she answered with set lips the reply startled and did not please him for god s sake he said is this a time to talk of love when we are all lying with our necks under the knife i have but one sweetheart one wife one hope france a look of pain and sorrow shot across her face shut up in paris you know that her absolute decree of divorce has been granted she said yes and i am glad it is so she will marry probably she has done so already added the woman it would be all the same to me he responded wearily but you are mistaken he is here in paris here she cried with a start here he called at this house this morning he has been in the city for some weeks her look of incredulity faded slowly away what is he doing here he cannot be in sympathy with us no he is only waiting an opportunity to get away he was caught when the siege began she eyed him narrowly and he calls on you are you friends with him he took up a book on the table a life of and turned the leaves i am no longer the friend or the enemy of any man he said i am only the friend or the enemy of principles s affairs are without interest to me i care no longer for anything but the and as she gazed at him with new inquiry he added my little daughter who is here with me she could not help a blind and jealousy of his wife s child her at that moment you took a child from her then i left one and took one she agreed that it was fair but of what interest are these things to you f we can never again be more than the merest mo husband s friend the past as far as you and i are concerned buried she was a picture of audacity as she replied a why she demanded harshly because i wish it so he answered with all my time all my energies all my thoughts are embarked in the cause of the freedom of france my life has hitherto been full of errors i will keep it as it should be henceforth there seemed little use in talking to him but she did not know when she would have another opportunity do not forget one thing she said your first mistake was when you married all the others grew out of that one perhaps so i will not dispute you he answered but what is the use of discussing it now there is this use she said you have never heard

picturesque of wild shrubs and blossoms but now it is only chill and barren and neglected the spring has and the tips of the twigs but not enough to make the bushes look really alive yet the heap of clay by the grave too was of a hideous tint and horribly and just as the coffin was being lowered a wild figure suddenly appeared from somewhere behind the of and low which skirt the fence on one side it proved to be old mrs who with rags and and even her gray hair fluttering as she moved half ran down the path toward us she must have been hiding in the woods waiting and i found afterward that she had been seen lurking about yesterday though for some reason she had not been to her house now she had evidently been drinking and she was a dreadful thing to look at i wonder why it is that nature which makes almost any other ruin picturesque never in making the wreck of humanity anything but hideous an old tower an old tree even an old house has somehow a quality that is but an old man is apt to look and an old woman who has given up taking care of herself is repulsive perhaps we cannot see humanity with the impartial eyes with which we regard nature but i do not think this is the whole of it somehow and for some reason an ruin is generally attractive while a human ruin is ugly mrs seemed to me an of the repulsive she made me shudder with some sort of a feeling that she was wicked through and through even the pity she made me feel could not prevent my the of a saint sense that she was vicious i wanted to wash my hands just for having seen her i was ashamed to be so and of course it was because she was so hideous to look at but i do not think i could have borne to have her touch me stop she called out i m the mother of the corpse don t you dare to bury her till i get there i glanced at tom in spite of myself he had been stern and pale au the morning not saying a word more than was necessary but now the color came into his face all at once i could not bear to see him and tried to look at the mother but and pity made me choke she was panting with haste and by the time she reached us and stumbled over something in the path she caught at tom s arm to save herself and there she hung up into his face you did n t mean for me to come did you she broke out half and half she was mine before she was yours you killed her too tom kept himself still though it must have been terribly hard he must have been in agony and i could have sobbed to think how he suffered he grew white as i have never seen him but he did not look at the old woman she was perhaps too distracted with drink and i hope with grief to know what she was doing she turned suddenly and looked at the coffin which rested on the edge of the grave my handsome she oh my handsome i they re all dead now what did you put on her did you make a or put on a dress she has a white i said quickly i saw to everything myself april she turned to me with a air and let go her clasp on tom s arm i m grateful miss she said we ain t much but we re grateful i hope you won t let em bury my handsome till i ve seen her she went on with a manner she was my before she was anybody else s and it ain t goin to hurt nobody for me to see her i d like to see that how much natural grief how much vanity how much excitement was in her wish i cannot tell but there was nothing to do but to have the coffin opened when the face of the dead woman had once more been uncovered to the light the dreadful mother hung over it and now she shrieked for her handsome and in a way that pierced to the then she would fall to laughter over the just like a lady s  but then was a lady after she was married miss tom and i stood apart while mr tried to get the excited creature away and the grave looked on with open curiosity i could not help thinking how they would tell the story and of how tom s name would be about in connection with it sometimes i feel as if it were harder to bear the of life than actual sorrows father used to say that pain is personal but vulgarity a of general principles this is one of his sayings which i do not feel that i understand entirely and yet i have some sense of what he meant a thing which is vulgar seems to fly in the face of all that should be and our sense of the fitness of things well somehow we got through it all it is over the of a saint and is in her grave i cannot but think that it is better if she does not remember if she has gone out like an ill burning candle nothing is left now but to consider what can be done for the lives that we can reach i am afraid that the mother is beyond me but for tom i can perhaps do something for baby i should do much april it is so strange to have a child in the house i feel queer and disconcerted when i think	charles-dickens

is that the only ground on which you swear put it there himself that s ground enough answer my question if you please yes it is and my belief that robbed his uncle of his money that will do we shall give you the little end of the horn to crawl out of before we get through added squire dock sour and sat down near the rocking chair of mr and mr caesar cabin steward of the flag was politely invited to take the stand he appeared in his best clothes and his name quality and position on board of the were duly by the magistrate what do you know about the money or the bag asked squire op fortune or i know all about it your honor replied the witness with a radiant smile who put them in the where they were found did your honor that s been to say that interposed dock savagely who do you call a demanded mr stepping briskly up to dock with his fists doubled up for use i never was convicted of crime and sent to the state prison order called the justice dock was the more disturbed of the two but the him while mr patched up the wounded dignity of the cabin steward who wag doubtless a much better man than dock he had formerly been the body servant of a french gentleman in and he could read and write and spoke french he wrote his name c and he insisted that his should be pronounced a ba ne a he was a person of no little importance in his own estimation and had a southern negro s contempt for mean half sound the world of whom dock seemed to be the meanest specimen he had yet seen now mr we will proceed with this examination a ba ne a if you please your honor suggested the witness with the of bows i beg your pardon mr said the justice with a smile you placed the bag and the money in the  did you i did your honor in the captain s but i didn t comprehend what was in the bag at the particular moment when it was in my possession exactly so i was not precisely informed in regard to the nature of the contents of the bag which was in a mass and exceedingly heavy for the bulk of the parcel appearing to consist only of a portion of tow cloth just so mr we are fortunate in being able to understand you i beg your honor s pardon but the e in my should be pronounced like long a excuse me laughed the justice but of fortune or my french is rather rusty will you do me the favor to indicate in what manner the bag and its contents came into your possession with pleasure your honor yesterday afternoon just previous to captain s going on shore  who asked squire who was not familiar with s new title captain your honor you mean no your honor far be it from me to commit the gross of calling the captain of the in which i sail by his christian name captain your honor go on then i know whom you mean yesterday afternoon just as captain was going on shore  i the precise time but it was about five o clock post that is sufficiently accurate mr do me the favor to proceed i beg your honor s pardon but these have a tendency to prevent me from following accurately and the thread of my narrative half bound the world the magistrate bowed and laughed as all in the room were doing except dock and mr the witness commenced his story again repeating everything he had said before and the squire did not deem it prudent to interrupt him again i was in a standing position near the entrance to the main cabin and your honor is aware that in first class the descent in the standing room which in new york is more frequently called the at a distance of not more than a quarter of a marine league from our lay a fishing which i was informed by those who probably possessed an accurate knowledge of the intended movements of the though i really could not now state to your honor the names of the parties from whom i received this intimation  not interposed the squire the information i received may prove to be material your honor i was informed that the vessel intended to sail for the grand banks or the coast of i cannot now swear which or indeed if it was either of these possibly of fortune or it was either possibly it was neither or possibly it was both i wish it particularly understood that under the solemnity of an oath i do not state positively where the vessel was going suffice it to say that she was going on a fishing voyage but whether for or or either or all or a portion of these inhabitants of the mighty deep i am entirely unable to say the court counsel and witnesses with the exceptions before noted roared with laughter and the cabin steward smiled complacently as though he was conscious of having made a point i can only observe under oath that i was informed that the vessel intended to depart in search of some of the numerous specimens that in herds through the boundless depths of the sea  as soon as the tide turned a excuse me mr but what ha ul this to do with the money and the bag asked the justice choking down his laughter w i trust i shall be able to to the entire satisfaction of your honor that there is an intimate connection between these circumstances and the half round thb world articles discovered in the state room of captain go on then it is almost dinner time	isabella-lucy-bird
his chamber that his agency was in a fair way to make a good thing and when got this far he generally had a pretty clear idea of what he was talking about while his coffee in dressing gown and slippers he had the morning paper brought to him he glanced over its columns rapidly with the trained eye a sugar princess of an expert pausing occasionally for a second or two at some piece of news suddenly he chanced upon one which caused even his steady head to he caught his breath several times as he read and re read the that his attention putting down the paper at last he rang for hot water and proceeded leisurely to himself when this was done he wrote a brief note to his partner asking him to call on him before going to the office mr had never known the test to fail he did not wish mr to see that he had undergone the least trace of excitement the of the showed that he could appear as calm as an notwithstanding the temptation to show the reason why he had sent for his partner was that he wished to consult with him alone and knew that would be certain to put in an early appearance at the office when mr appeared he did not look in the least like the dear to the readers of fiction he was on the contrary apparently an sort of who might have been a or dealer he seemed a combination of earnestness and the of force but of the kind when he was admitted he did not the least curiosity as to why he had been summoned he merely uttered a conventional good morning and took a seat it s affair of peter s said speaking with the nephew was in to see me last night a sugar princess mr listened but made no remark he s been hunting for the old man in the natural channels and had an idea that he d been or murdered i m going to take the case on speculation have you seen the morning papers mr shook his head well listen to this he read aloud an occurred in the bay yesterday afternoon which happily resulted in worse than a scare and for a party of people a containing mr william van miss van miss and mr s was run not far from house by the lucky through what seems to been criminal carelessness all the people mentioned were thrown water but were luckily rescued by the and a young man whose name has not been ascertained the van are of the family well known in and miss van recently from miss s school on the heights mr listened attentively enough but his face gave no sign that he found the paragraph particularly exciting well he remarked at last just this the young man s name has been me and he is the nephew of his uncle queer was the quiet remark of the other man it would be in any business but ours now i should say this young man had best be left to me to manage a sugar princess as you please how is he off for funds pretty short and you ll let him get a little shorter naturally mr s face softened into something almost like a smile is there anything else asked mr no i only suggest that the boy had better not see you around the office if you can come an hour or two late for the present i will get rid of him before you arrive no reply was needed to this and mr took his leave as silently as he had made his appearance an hour later when mr entered his business rooms he found there as he expected the young man looked the eager inquiry that was in his mind you had quite an adventure yesterday said a very slight one but about mr have you learned anything i think i can assure you that he is alive and safe where asked breathless it may several days before i can answer that positively a dis look filled the anxious eyes have you formed any theory as to his strange ence other than the spoke hoarsely the one you advanced yesterday mr nodded like a man to whom all secrets were that t i have done though i can bring as yet n absolute proof i think he has gone insane uttered a quick exclamation of dismay a sugar princess that would not account for mr disappearing also he suggested yes it would at present i do not care to say too much in relation to the matter i have set on foot which will reveal something in a few days till then i must ask you to have patience a few days may not seem long in ordinary matters but the time was likely to be wearisome enough at that juncture s funds were nearly exhausted he had nothing left that would bring if with the uncertainty that hung over him he could not engage himself at any occupation he was on a barren rock from which he did not even dare depart should any friendly sail come hi sight except the one he most longed for come in any morning at this hour continued mr not later as i am very busy i have your address if anything important occurs i will send for you good day nothing could be gained by confiding to this man of steel the extreme of his resources and left the office much arriving at his room his heart gave a bound to find that a letter had arrived bearing his name and also the printed address of the lawyer of st louis eagerly he tore open the envelope but the contents were merely formal no news of mr or his companion had been received wrote principally to say this	arthur-conan-doyle
to call at his office and to bring his attorney with him if mr was at hand who was lounging away the afternoon in his very dull fashion at the hotel was thankful for anything to vary the monotony though he had no idea what wanted he summoned mr and together they walked down to see tb lawyer i wife chapter xx i represent your wife present your wife was the statement of mr as soon as he had welcomed his visitor and gone through the ceremony of introduction to mr there is something disagreeable to any man in meeting for the first time a legal gentleman who is to use this phrase and felt a chill creeping through his bones i represent your wife repeated mr and again i understand that you intend to obtain a divorce from her if you can on a certain which you propose to bring now i think you would dislike to accuse her of anything of which she is not guilty in other words that you are not in the matter i think i am able to show you by satisfactory evidence that you have been deceived by a person mr put in a word when do you intend to give us your reasons for this extraordinary assertion mr mr replied that he proposed if mr desired it to put him in the way of proving that his were true within fifteen hours before i say what i will or will not do mr interposed i must remind you that my wife has also made against me i would like to inquire if she is willing to withdraw them her husband s friend if they can be shown to be as at yours are against her said mr i may safely say they will be abandoned at once at the if but he assured mr that it had been his full intention when he came to to allow his wife a separation with complete honor to her name and he added that he should still prefer his original plan which he briefly as he had given it to there will be a good deal less trouble in the world put in mr when people learn to their business affairs to men of the law if you had come to me in the first place mr and sent me to see your wife arrangements could have been made and all avoided to this view mr warmly assented as no doubt mr would have done had the third counsel in the case been present and all the other members of the bar for that matter what is it that you want me to do asked you said something about a conspiracy i did responded mr are you prepared to undergo a great shock to your feelings to find that one in whom you have placed confidence has set deliberately about your ruin i think i can put into your own hands the means of a plot of which you are the victim it will require nerve and courage on your part but if you will agree to play the cards according to my instruction the game is in your hands listened but he told the lawyer to state his proposition you must go to boston to night on the late train and take a cab to your residence seeing i in the morning as early as half past eight o clock you must make a call on your friend miss c a sudden start betrayed the surprise of the he to speak but suppressed the inclination go on sir he said i want you to see your friend before she ha opened her morning mail in which if i do not mistake there will be a letter post marked you must possess yourself of the contents of that letter mr paused and met his eye with an smile a truly ingenious plan he said but before i agree to do an act which appears on its face the most contemptible in the world will you tell me what i am to expect to find in this mysterious communication the lawyer sat back in his chair and with a pencil that lay on the table possibly that your supposed friends are your worst enemies and your supposed enemies your best friends he replied slowly it is not for me to say you have been married for nine years to one of the loveliest girls in if you prefer to believe her guilty of that from which her soul would revolt you will neglect this opportunity to prove her innocence do you charge miss miss c with being one of the against me he demanded charge no one with anything by an accident i am in a position to give you this advice follow it or not as you please if you get possession of that letter do not part with it husband s friend mr who had looked on with somewhat sour countenance now interrupted do you advise my to steal that letter mr smiled i should have no hesitation in a man to commit a little crime when it will prevent a great one he replied the letter in question will probably be mr will be able to read it before he whether it is worth carrying away could not help a growing distrust of mr whose story seemed to him quite absurd how could he possibly know so well the contents of a letter and even whether it was or was not in a sealed envelope have you anything more to say he asked rising nothing was the response shall you follow my suggestion we will consider that subject together said mr mr will remember i trust that you are his wife s counsel not his we wish you good day sir on the way back to the house the extraordinary proposition was discussed at length and both men found

clearly as i can you remember that in my last i explained to you how i had been getting at home and how my mistake had annoyed my n the letters father and had made my position here very uncomfortable then i mentioned i think that i had received a letter from the lawyers well i brushed up my sunday hat and my mother stood on a chair and landed me twice on the ear with a clothes brush under the impression that she was making the collar of my overcoat look more with which out i into the world the dear soul standing on the steps peering after me and waving me success well i was in considerable

manner and that sort of scotch precision of speech which gives the impression of clearness of thought behind it i understand from professor that you have been looking about for an opening mr said he had said that he would give me a hand if he could but you remember that he had a reputation for giving the letters such promises rather easily i speak of a man as i find him and to me he has been an excellent friend i should be very happy to hear of any opening said i of your medical there is no need to speak he went on running his eyes all over me in the most questioning way your of medicine will answer for that but professor thought you peculiarly fitted for this for physical reasons may i ask you what your weight is fourteen stone and you stand i should judge about six feet high precisely accustomed too as i gather to muscular exercise of every kind well there can be no question that you are the very man for the post and i shall be very happy to recommend you to lord you forget said i that i have not j et heard what the position is or the terms which you offer he began to laugh at that it was a little the letters on my part said he but i do not think that we are likely to to position or terms you may have heard perhaps of the sad misfortune of our lord not to put it briefly then his son the hon james the heir to the estates and the only child was struck down by the sun while fishing without his hat last july his mind has never recovered from the shock and he has been ever since in a state of moody which breaks out every now and then into violent his father will not allow him to be removed from castle and it is his desire that a medical man should stay there in constant attendance upon his son your physical strength would of course be very useful in those violent attacks of which i have spoken the will be twelve pounds a month and you would be required to take over your duties to morrow i walked home my dear with a bounding heart and the pavement like cotton wool under my feet i found just in my pocket and i spent the whole of it on a really good cigar with which to the occasion old has always had a very high opinion the letters of for get a lunatic my boy get a lunatic he used to say then it was not only the situation but the fine connection that it opened up i seemed to see exactly what would happen there would be illness in the family  lord himself perhaps or his wife there would be no time to send for advice i would be consulted i would gain their confidence and become their family attendant they would recommend me to their wealthy friends it was all as clear as possible i was before i reached home whether it would be worth my while to give up a country practice in order to take the which might be offered me my father took the news enough with some rather remark about my patient and me being well qualified to keep each other company but to my mother it was a flash of joy followed by a of consternation i had only three under shirts the best of my linen had gone to to be and the night gowns were not marked yet  there were a dozen of those domestic difficulties of which the mere male never thinks a the letters dreadful vision of lady looking over my things and finding the heel out of one of my my mother out we together and before evening her soul was at rest and i had in advance my first month s salary she was great as we walked home upon the grand people into whose service i was to enter as a matter of fact my dear said she they are in a sense relations of yours you are very closely allied to the and the have blood in them also they are only a branch and you are close upon the main line but still it is not for us to deny the connection she brought a cold sweat out upon me by suggesting that she should make things easy by writing to lord and explaining our respective positions several times during the evening i heard her murmur complacently that they were only the branch am i not the of story but you encourage me to it by your sympathetic interest in details however i shall move along a little faster now next morning i was off to which as you know is in the north of it stands

situated mr made a similar observation when handed him what had sent to her for his perusal they thought to themselves that nothing could be better for a young man in college than the true friendship of such girls who had been sisters to him for so long the mothers were equally well satisfied and encouraged a of the correspondence they liked and approved of him in every way it would encourage a taste for writing in their daughters and so be of benefit to all concerned told his father in a letter sent in the same mail with these that he had written to the girls and john pondered over the matter a good while uncertain what to do he had rather not have had it so and yet he could give no reason even to his own mind for this feeling the result of his was that he would say nothing about it he realized that it might be something like making a mountain out of a to forbid his son to continue the letters he believed that the new connections would make at the university would be likely to crowd these to one side in short order that they would in fact take care of themselves if left alone he was gratified as he frequently had had occasion to be with the which made confide everything to him and he feared to a policy which might make him liable to resort to double dealing it was not easy for mr to spare the money necessary to give his son this higher education but if it had taken his last penny if it had compelled him to live on bread and water to accomplish it he and was determined that should be a gentleman all the pride he had went into this account the ill luck that he expected that he almost seemed to follow all of his farming operations he had poorer crops than his fellow though his land was naturally as good as any he always sold his grain at the price and paid interest on notes he had no hope of ever getting himself free from these obligations but if could be made a gentleman could be raised above the heads of the by education and profession that would for all the rest he had never intimated to his son that money was so scarce with him the boy had not the least idea that the sum needed to pay the first quarter of his college expenses was borrowed of a by a on what live stock and machinery was already from similar process on which interest was to be paid at the rate of four per cent a month he went into college with all the bright hopes of youth provided with a of pocket money for his needs and with only one instruction from his father to live as well as the rest the first time he came home to spend the short christmas it was hard to tell which of the three families laid the most claim to him he had to accept invitations to dinner at both the and and at each of them and were included in the list of those who sat around the board john was invited also but as the for his presence came together he felt obliged to refuse both of them he would have liked well enough to dine with colonel family but he had no idea f stepping inside the stately the g home of he could not go to one and decline the other without unpleasant notice and so he made an excuse to both of lack of and previous engagements was dry for accounts of his life in college though he declared that he had told everything in his frequent letters to and his room mate figured in all his experiences and was described as such a chap that colonel and mr both gave him a cordial invitation to bring his friend with him the next time he came this reminded him that he had a photograph of in his pocket which he produced and passed around the table the girls were agreed in praise of his appearance and hoped they should soon have the pleasure of seeing him he s awful nice said and i shall be glad to bring him if he will come i should think he might in the summer his folks live in and they are immensely rich chapter iv the girl with the ankles when the summer arrived did not come home immediately from college he went with young to the country place of the latter s

it was not long before the reached where was speedily introduced to the young girls of whom he had heard his friend speak and about whom he had formed so many opinions knowing that they were still under sixteen it had seemed to very odd that should find it worth his while to devote so many hours in the month in writing to them before he had been in a week however he learned to take an entirely different view he admitted to himself that these girls were not at all like the ordinary of their age and that he had never seen two such charming creatures as they turned out to be was not long in deciding that it was who interested him most but try as he might he could not discover that there was any difference between them in s favor if he walked with one of them to day in the excursions

questions but he could obtain no satisfactory answer he spoke to and was told by that that he was going to the ball simply to amuse himself from the he learn absolutely nothing and the families gave no sign that they took any interest whatever in politics notwithstanding all this absence new rings for old of proof tortured himself with fancies and then consoled his mind with the fatal reflection that de without whom they could do nothing was still in england on one point however he congratulated himself and that was that he also would be present at the ball k it were a political meeting under the guise of a he could order at once to arrest all those present and the conspiracy if such existed could at once be in the bud unfortunately for this idea he was quite unaware that was the part of a political and betraying his country for money otherwise he would have taken immediate steps to secure his already doubtful position thinking thus in this manner he neglected to assure himself of the truth of the matter and day after day passed without anything being done until the night of the famous ball duly arrived owing to the incessant activity of the and all was prepared for the of the

by that the money required for the of the rebel leader was in the villa all was going and the success of the conspiracy was looked upon as certain by all the inmates of villa  with the exception of major that gentleman had resolved to obtain the ring in london no one can be absolutely certain of the future replied the duke quietly but all that human power can do has been done to n the affair a success and yet if chance  all our ingenious plans will be true but so far as we can judge there is absolutely no fear of failure if we secure and arrest the republic will be at an end true replied if  you answer as the answered philip of hitherto you have been certain that all will go well now on the eve of you are doubtful one is never certain till the event happens said significantly supposing the sum required by is not oh but it will be i saw it myself it is in the possession of s and he will pay it over to to night let us hope so if such is the case of course will be proclaimed queen and

promptly she will make a good sovereign hard cold and she has all the of a female ruler do you indeed think she is so lacking in asked the duke with a sudden flush new rings for old major answered the question indirectly de to be a great sovereign and to be so must be a woman with a man s heart those female rulers who have lacked the weaknesses of their sex alone have been great she will sacrifice love to ambition murmured the duke half to himself she has done so replied the remark she will marry for ambition for political purposes to the of her house but not for love did not pursue the subject he felt in his own heart that the view taken by was a correct one and that it was useless for him to expect the princess to return his passion nevertheless he did not care about discussing this delicate subject with the major as he had no particular liking for that gentleman and looked upon his passion as too sacred a thing to be lightly spoken of to avoid further remarks on the subject he walked to the other end of the terrace and when he returned to the major found him talking to the was in high glee as everything was going well and he hoped that de would that night sleep in the palace of her ancestors there is absolutely no possibility of failure he said our plans are too well laid to fail yet it all depends upon hinted the major quietly in to a considerable extent it does but he is faithful provided he receives the money as has been arranged he will support the queen to the end i should not be inclined to put much faith in a traitor who his country for money said the duke bitterly paradise shot a keen glance at the sombre face of the young man and answered with apparent lightness but deep significance  you know the motto of the the end the means that saying is

his opinion that the wife might have done the little work there was for the present with the and sent out he had to raise himself above his present position he believed a few thousand dollars would enable him to realize a fortune out of an invention in the line on which he had spent his leisure moments for years he had part of the money already saved and the increase in his salary had meant a hastening of the day when he would have all he required for the purpose still he bought the things and hired the servant as i have said and the first months of his wedded life were not wholly devoid of happiness the cottage was brighter for the presence of a young woman of some attractions and the meals thanks mainly to the servant were well cooked and served en time not being inclined to the new

book as anything else while he went on with his experiments now conducted with perfect safety at home there was no danger that the would be for dust might have accumulated an inch deep on them without his wife s attention it was rather sometimes to note the languid look with which she met his delighted cries that he had george and made a successful combination but he grew used to this she was not to blame if her enthusiasm did not equal his in a field of which she knew nothing when the great day should come and he could show her the result of all this tiresome detail she would appreciate it then in the meantime he could afford to wait there was another thing that troubled him more something that he could not complain of even to her without feeling ashamed mrs had a for the physical tokens of love almost to aversion george would have a different woman to her heart s content but all such advances were received in a manner that made him timid at first he gave a kiss when he left the house and when he returned but she offered him her cheek more as if she expected a blow than a caress if she was reading and she usually was he often had to speak twice before she answered his remark i said good bye he would repeat with his hand on the door and a slight start as of one who would rather not be disturbed she would say without raising her eyes oh yes good bye certainly it was not marriage as he had conceived it earth brings nothing so sweet as the first months of wedded life to those who are happily this period was almost wholly lost to the they did not quarrel but neither was there much love making there was no pair of birds in any tree in that could not have set them a better example out of none of their neighbors noticed anything none but drew who still had this marriage on her conscience and whose eyes were watchful she knew things were not exactly right though she did not understand just how they were george took his wife to church as do al self respecting people in small towns whether they have any interest in the doctrines preached or not they also went to some of the parish meetings and occasionally to of other kinds when the weather was fine they walked together in the evening george had always been a man of sober mien and the absence of a smile on his face did not surprise his fellow n mrs drew alone noticed that there was a new expression there one she did not like to see she was the more sorry because she had such an ideal married life of her own and was now the mother of a beautiful little girl that looked like its proud papa something is the matter with george and she said to herself i wish i could help them ah there is one thing that would bring them completely together she added with a blush if they ever get a beam of sunshine in the house like my little it will end all their differences tell me you love him chapter v tell me you love him but there was not likely to be any such beam of sunshine as baby in the home

silence i shall spend most of my here said is there any way in which i can help you his father was astonished at the question he had never asked his son for the slightest assistance upon the farm knowing his for agricultural pursuits and he could not understand what put this idea into his head but he contented himself with a simple negative after eating his supper strolled over to mr house where both the girls were awaiting him as they had agreed to do before they parted at the train there was one thing that mr wanted more than anything else now and that was to see and have another talk with her he did not know how to arrange it and over a week passed before he happened to meet her where others were not present when the opportunity came and he encountered her on the road from the place to her own home he only stopped to say good morning and to ask her when she could find time to see him in private i have something to say to you said he it do you love my son will not take long but i do not wish to be interrupted i shall consider any time mine that you was the prompt answer the sooner it is over the better he mused i will send away to night on an errand if you will call at the house better make it nine o clock or about that i will be there she replied and they separated promptly at the time appointed she came and found him sitting alone on the awaiting her he had given a commission that would take him away for an hour or two and as he seldom had visitors no one was likely to disturb them i know you will believe miss he said coming directly to the point that there is no one whom i would rather please than you nearly a year ago i was about to arrange a piece of business which i thought necessary when in obedience to your request i postponed it you mean i trust that you abandoned it altogether she interrupted him to say i post it he answered deliberately for a year the time is nearly expired and i want no misunderstanding i have wished many times that i had not made you that promise but having made it i kept it nothing could induce me to make it again may i not hope she began he stopped her with a trace of impatience that is all there is to that subject if you please now will you tell me if you and are as good friends as ever she struggled with herself a moment for she felt the ton that she was defeated but she thought it best not to cross him she responded that she and were on the same pleasant terms that they had always been but excuse me you know why i ask it is there more nothing definite between you she shook her head with deepening color oh there is so much time for that why it be years and years before i shall want to think of it a ut meanwhile you have no fears of losing him she sm l ed now not nor that she is and always will be our dearest friend unless she added you are so cruel as to destroy that r he spoke with more earnestness than she had supposed him capable of exhibiting do you love my son ery much she looked into his eyes a startled at his manner yes she said timidly you would not like to have take him from you no and from the heavenly blue of her eyes there fell a on his hand then let me warn you not to let him be close in this friendship with that handsome girl he is easily influenced he has a soul as gentle as your own and the slightest thing may turn him it is the height of folly for you to imagine that they can be thrown together at all seasons without something do love my son more than ordinary attraction draw him away from her before you are too late listened to him with alarm but not with any fear that his words could come true she trembled at the thought that he should have formed such an idea why loves me she answered in a whisper it is not necessary that he should say so in words or that any promise should be made between us we have loved each other ever since we were children he has shown his affection for me in a thousand ways i know it i feel it is our dear friend whom i could never suspect of she knows our love for each other though it has never been talked over and why should it be ah mr you do her wrong if you entertain the slightest suspicion that she would separate and me she was so earnest that he wished he could agree with her but he was a practical man and he told her that he was fully convinced to the contrary if you think it to find from his own lips just how he stands said he i shall endeavor to discover it for myself i could never consent that son of mine should link his life with a daughter of you think you say you are sure that he never would do so i also must be certain for i assure you loving as i do and he is the only thing on earth for whom i care much i would never allow him to speak to me again never own him as a relation should he make a marriage of that kind he had spoken at an unusual length for him and she had the rest of the conversation principally to herself most	arthur-conan-doyle

web more closely woven than human life to day when i had not seen tom for months and when the gossip of last night made me want to talk with him chance brought us face to face january mother was so comfortable that i went out for an hour the day was delightful cold enough so that the walking was dry and the snow firm but the air not sharp to the cheek the sun was warm and cheery and the shadows on the white fields had a lovely softness i went on in a sort of dream it was so good to be alive and out of doors in such wonderful weather i turned to go down the rim road and it was not until i came in sight of the red house that i remembered what miss said last night then i began to think about tom tom and i have always been such good friends i used to understand tom better in the old school days than the others did and he was always ready to tell me what he thought and felt nowadays i hardly ever see him since i became engaged he has almost never come to the house though he used to be here so much i meet him only once or twice a year and then i think he tries to avoid me i am so sorry to have an old friendship broken off like that the red house made me think of tom with a sore heart of all the talk his wild ways have caused the sorrow of his father and the good that is being lost when a fellow with a heart so big as tom s goes wrong suddenly tom himself appeared before my very eyes as if my thought had him up he came so unexpectedly that at first i could hardly realize how he came then it flashed across me that he must have walked round the red house i suppose he must have come out of a back door somewhere like one of the family such folk never use their front doors he walked along the road toward me at first so that he did not recognize me when he saw my face he half hesitated as if he had almost the of a saint a mind to turn back and his whole face turned red he came on however and was going past me with a scant salutation when i stopped him i stood still and put out my hand so that he could not go by without speaking good afternoon tom i said is n t it a glorious day he looked about him with a strange air as if he had not noticed and i saw how heavy and weary his eyes were yes he answered it is a fine day where do you keep yourself tom i went on hardly knowing what i said but trying to think what it was best to say i never see you and we used to be such good friends he looked away and moved his lips as if he muttered something but when i asked what he said he turned to me look here what s the good of pretending you know i don t go to see you because you re engaged to george you chose between us and there s the end of that what s more you know that nowadays i m not fit to go to see anybody that s decent then it is time that you were was my answer let me walk along with you i want to say something i turned and we walked together toward the village i could see that his face hardened it s no sort of use to preach to me he said though your preaching powers are pretty good i ve had so much preaching in my life that i m not to be rounded up by piety i smiled as well as i could though it made me want to cry to hear the hard of his tone january i m not generally with piety tom the whole town thinks all the heathen know i it s a pity there were n t a few more of em i laughed and thanked him for the compliment and then we went on in silence for a little way i had to what he said about george but it did not make it easier to begin i was puzzled what to say but the time was short that we should be walking together and i had to do something tom i began you may not be very sensitive about old but i am loyal and it hurts me that those i care for should be talked against oh in a place like he returned at once i could see on the they u talk about anybody will they then i suppose they talk about me i m sorry tom for it must make you uncomfortable to hear it unless that is you don t count me for a friend any longer he threw back his head in the way he has always had i used to tell him it was like a s shaking back its mane what nonsense of course they don t talk about you you don t give folks any chance and you do i added as quietly as i could he looked angry for just the instant and then he burst into a hard laugh caught by you were always too clever for me to deal with well then i do give the plenty to talk about they would talk just the same if i did n t so i may as well have the game as the name the of a saint does that mean that your life is regulated by the i supposed that you had more independence tom he flushed and stooped down to pick up a	charles-dickens
commanded me too in a way he has done what i wished and what i thought best but i have always known he could be influenced only so far and that if i wanted what he did not believe in he could be as as a rock the hardness of his mother shows itself in him as the foundation for the gentleness he gets from his father miss came in for a moment to day and by instinct she knew that something had made me happy she was full of sympathy for a moment and then i think some suspicion came into her dear old head which she would not have there my dear she said in her rough way you look too cheerful f the head of a asylum and a house of refuge i hope you ve made george promise to marry his own wife  though if i made the laws it would n t be necessary for a man to marry a woman more than once i ve no idea of that have to come round once in so often like house cleaning she was watching me so keenly as she spoke that i smiled in spite of myself no i told her i have n t been able to make him but tom has undertaken to bring him round so i believe it will be all right whether she understood or not i cannot tell but from the loving way in which she leaned over and kissed me i suspect she had some of it november november they are married just after dusk to night i heard the and came in with a queer look on her face to say that mr and mr were in the hall i went out to them at once and tried to act as if everything had been arranged between us george was pale and stem he would not look at me and i did not exchange a word directly with him while he was in the house except to say good evening and good by i kept them waiting just a moment or two while i prepared and then i called them upstairs she behaved very well acting as if she were a little frightened but accepting everything without a word i suspect she is too ill really to care for anything very much the ceremony was over quickly and then george went away without noticing his wife further except to say good night tom came in for a moment later to see that everything was well and of course i asked him how he had brought george to consent he smiled rather grimly i did it simply enough he said i tried easy words first and appealed to him as a gentleman  though of course i knew it was no use if such a plea would have done any good i should n t have been there then i said he would n t be in if he did n t make it right for his wife he said he guessed he could fix that and if other people would mind their own business he could attend to his then i opened the door and called in i had him waiting outside because i knew would understand he meant business i asked him to say what we d agreed and he told that if he didn t marry the woman before midnight we d have him ridden out of town on a rail he weakened at that he knew we d do it the of a saint i could not say anything to this it was a man s way of treating the situation and it accomplished its end but it did affect me a good deal i shivered at the very idea of a mob and of what might have happened if george had not yielded tom saw how i felt i suppose you think i m a brute he said but i knew he d give in he is n t very i always knew that he hurried away to go to the reading room where he had to see to something or other and we said nothing about our personal relations i wonder if i fancied that j ie watched me very closely to see how i took his account or if he really thought i might resent his having george he need not have feared i was troubled by the idea of the mob but i was proud of tom and i could not help his clear straightforward look with the way george avoided my eyes november now there are two babies in the house and cousin might think her that i would set up an orphan asylum was coming true in earnest in spite of mrs s exposure everything is going well and we hope or the best i sent george a note last night to tell him and he came over for a minute he behaved very well he had none of the which has made him so different and so dreadful and he was more like his old self he was let into his wife s chamber just long enough to kiss her but that was all i suppose to be the father of a son must sober any man november tom never comes any more to see november me or baby when i discovered i cared for him i felt that of course everything was at last straightened out and here is tom who only knows that he cares for me so the case is about as it was before except that now he will never speak i must do something but what can i do when i thought only of getting out of the way of george s marriage it was bad enough to speak to tom and now it seems impossible i can t i can t i can t speak to him again november cousin	charles-dickens

visit her happened to walk home with her from some public occasion and talk half an hour at the gate before they parted in this way he found it worth his while to remain in all the rest of the summer to be sure he went away occasionally for a few days at a time to new york or boston generally boston miss gave up her thursday evenings during august but received regularly on sundays there were so many of her followers she said who were unable to leave with the fashionable crowd which thronged the and mountain that she felt it her duty to open her doors at least once a week even though she had sometimes to come from a long distance to do so once or twice remained over until monday at her request for private but there was very little said on these occasions that is worth all she seemed to desire was to him of her regard and to avail herself of h s information in reference to certain events that were they always spoke about in a general way but both were careful to avoid being drawn into another argument in which they would be sure to differ at the sunday evening affairs who never failed to seemed to grow week by week those who knew him best were completely at a loss to account for his manner mrs st john remarked several times to miss that he had become so dull she was almost sorry for bringing him but could never be dull in the eyes of miss she listened to every word that he uttered as if it were the speech of an she could see without the least trouble that husband s friend he had taken a jealousy of for which she was quite confident he had no just grounds in fact he seemed displeased at every sign of confidence which miss had with any of her other guests and was clearly the of men one evening he left the house in company with and as soon as they were alone he launched into the subject that was him i want you to tell me one thing he said nervously i demand it as a right as a matter of between man and man let me know without do you love miss until he reached the words themselves had no conception of what he meant to say he had supposed that the coming question would refer entirely to but as he glanced at s pale face he could not help seeing that he was terribly in earnest such an idea never entered my head he replied candidly his inclination to say that was none of his business then why continued the other in a voice why do you visit her in private a little at this you have been acting the spy have you he aid coldly yes cried when a man is in my condition of mind he will do anything i love her she knows it i think everybody knows it when i first found it out was in the way he had gone out of the city but people were always talking about him when they mentioned her name four months have passed and still he does not return some are saying that he never will i was do t set f j fe just beginning to have hope when you came she pays more attention to you than to any one else who her you go to her house on other days and remain for hours why is it if there is no love between you why i say and he paused on the overcome by the violence of his emotions found his angry feelings melting away before the evident suffering of his companion mr he began slowly the three or four which i have had with miss have been solely on business matters if i had any intention of marrying assure you she would be the last person in the world of whom i should think in that connection as far as i am concerned you may set your mind wholly at rest searched his face and seemed satisfied of the of this answer but about he asked suddenly can you tell me whether i am in danger from him i have no right to say anything about that was the reply i think however that mr has no intention whatever of offering marriage to the lady in question but she loves him m m they are friends of many years standing that is all i am quite sure that matrimony is thought of by neither of them grasped s hand warmly thank you he exclaimed with you have given me new life regarded him with great curiosity it does not follow he pursued that miss will look with favor upon your suit i incline to the belief that she is single from choice and her husband s friend to remain so she is not young he added point past her at least and too full of tion and purposes j should say to think much of anything else but would not so easily give up the hopes which he had formed i know what you think he said that i am too much her junior i have no doubt she is three or four years older than i this should be no objection on her part and if i am content who is to care she is bound up in you say well i am no less so she has not an opinion on that subject which i do not share why should she treat me as he does he looked so pitiable that found his increasing to his great surprise if you wish me to advise you he began and short that is just it well then i should say to begin with that women are not won in the way you have adopted	arthur-conan-doyle
started off for a short stroll in the the incident from my mind as my wound had nearly healed by this time i took my leave of mr shortly afterwards the union armies were everywhere victorious and on so that my assistance seemed unnecessary and i returned to there i resumed my practice and married the second daughter of the well known wood in the course of a few years i built up a good connection and j s statement acquired considerable reputation in the treatment of complaints i still kept the old black stone in my pocket and frequently told the story of the dramatic way in which i had become possessed of it i also kept my resolution of showing it to professor who was much interested both by the anecdote and the specimen he pronounced it to be a piece of stone and drew my attention to the fact that its resemblance to an ear was not accidental but that it was most carefully worked into that shape a dozen little points showed that the had been as accurate as he was skilful i should not wonder said the professor if it were broken off from some larger statue though how such hard material could be so perfectly worked is more than i can understand if there is a statue to correspond i should like to see it so i thought at the time but i have changed my opinion since the next seven or eight years of my life were quiet and summer followed spring and spring followed winter without any in my duties as the practice increased i admitted j s as partner be to have one fourth of the profits the continued strain had told upon my constitution however and i became at last so that my wife insisted upon my consulting dr smith who was my at the hospital that gentleman examined me and pronounced the of my left to be in a state of me at the same time to go through a j ha ba st a course of medical and to take a long my own disposition which is naturally restless me strongly in favour of the latter piece of advice and the matter was by my meeting young of the firm of white white who offered me a passage in one of his father s ships the which was just starting from boston she is a snug little ship he said and the captain is an excellent fellow there is nothing like a sailing ship for an invalid i was very much of the same opinion myself so i closed with the offer on the spot my original plan wa that my wife should accompany me on my travels she has always been a very poor sailor however and there were strong family reasons against her exposing herself to any risk at the time so we determined that she should remain at home i am not a religious or an man y but oh thank god for that i as to leaving my practice i was easily reconciled to it as my partner was a and hard working man i arrived in boston on october and proceeded immediately to the office of the firm in order to thank them for their courtesy as i was sitting in the counting house waiting until they should be at liberty to see me the words suddenly attracted my attention looked round and saw a very tall gaunt man who was leaning across the polished mahogany counter asking some questions of the clerk j statement at the other side his face was turned half towards me and i could see that he had a strong dash of negro blood in him being probably a or even nearer akin to the black his curved nose and straight hair showed the white strain but the dark restless eye mouth and gleaming teeth all told of his african origin his complexion was of a sickly yellow and as his face was deeply with small the general impression was so as to be almost when he spoke however it was in a soft melodious voice and in well chosen words and he was evidently a man of some education i wished to ask a few questions about the he repeated leaning across to the clerk she sails the day after to morrow does she not yes sir said the young clerk awed into unusual politeness by the glimmer of a large diamond in the stranger s shirt front where is she bound for how many of a crew seven sir passengers yes two one of our young gentlemen and a doctor from new york no gentleman from the south asked the stranger eagerly no none sir is there room for another passenger  y s accommodation for three more answered the clerk i ll go said the i ll go i ll engage my passage at once put it down will you  mr of new the clerk filled up a form and handed it over to the stranger pointing to a blank space at the bottom as f mr stooped over to sign it i was to observe that the fingers of his right hand had been off and that he was holding the pen between his thumb and the palm i have seen thousands slain in battle and assisted at every conceivable operation but i cannot recall any sight which gave me such a thrill of disgust as that great brown like hand with the single member from it he used it enough however for dashing off his signature he nodded to the clerk and strolled out of the office just as mr white sent out word that he was ready to receive me i went down to the that evening and looked over my berth

living i suppose she bowed her head with a blush i do sewing it does not pay very well i am afraid she did not answer she was trying to think of the best way to end the conversation she had reached her home now and there was no longer any excuse for his remaining a rough looking man came out of the house and addressed the it is against the rules to talk on the in front of the house he said harshly either take your friend inside or go away with him quick to seize the opportunity mr took advantage of the girl s confusion and replied certainly we will go in just for a moment he added in a low tone there was no way to stop him except by a debate which she did not wish her landlord to hear and the girl led the way uneasily to the third floor where she paused with a key in her hand their marriage bond you claim to be a gentleman she said then in tones of entreaty if you are one i beg you to leave me i will do so in three minutes if you insist he replied lowering his voice to go now would subject me to suspicion from that pleasant proprietor of yours why my child i wouldn t harm you for the world he took out his watch three minutes i swear it she inserted the key in the lock and let him follow her the room into which they entered was poorly furnished but as neat as possible he took in everything at a glance you see she said biting her lips there is nothing to attract you i am a poor working girl nothing more as i supposed he replied but i also see that you were not always in that rank you have had an education your speech and manners show that you were well born and have moved in better society no don t speak just yet i am of my promise i have hardly two minutes left i want you to do me a favor she surveyed him with wide open eyes her expression not with doubt i want you to accept a little present she shrank away exclaiming no no but he persisted let us not waste time he held the watch in his hand while he talked i have a fortune the income of which is several times greater than my wants there is no sensible reason why you should not accept a trifle when it is so evident that you can find good use for it he laid several bank notes on the table their marriage bond what do you expect in return for this money she asked in return for the money nothing to be candid however i do hope that you will let me call again now i have convinced you that my purposes are honorable she sat down and commenced to weep by the promise i made and which i mean to keep said i have less than a minute left before i go will you tell me your name so that i may have the appearance of an honest man when i call for you there was a knock on the door hastily wiping her eyes the young woman went to open it well have you got the rent said a voice which recognized at once as that of the disagreeable person he had seen below stairs to morrow i will get it she answered with a feeling of shame that the gentlemanly appearing visitor should hear the demand you have told me that twice i do not run a free lodging house i shall wait no longer in the you will be put out you understand the man s steps were heard descending and the girl back into the room with renewed tears on her cheeks mr stood there awaiting her my time has all expired said he putting the watch in his pocket shall i go she looked at him with blinded eyes and then at the on the table don t leave that money she said i cannot take it you prefer to let the fellow who just called execute his threat she drew a long breath as of despair their marriage bond if he puts you out to morrow what will you do ah cried lifting her hands there is always a last resort and you would rather embrace it than take this money which i you freely she seemed to consider the two horns of the i promised you to go in three minutes he said i am ready to keep my word but is it not best that i sit down with you a moment longer and see if we cannot have an understanding she nodded him to resume his seat in a moment so very desolate it wag better to run some than to be left alone with her grief in he first place he continued take that money and put it in your purse it is yours i shall not touch it again under any circumstances he pushed it toward her with the hat that he held in his hand and she obeyed him mechanically though with evident reluctance now won t you tell me your name why do you want it because i feel that we ought not to end our acquaintance here because i believe that when you have thought a little longer you will say i may come again but she exclaimed turning red you can have only one object a man does not seek the company of a poor girl like me unless she was unable to proceed and you won t even tell me what name they call you he asked with his most winning smile you could find that by asking below she replied as if in thought it is mrs that is better he said but	arthur-conan-doyle
the time that it was by her wish that is why i came away from that night that is what kept me away how could i go back and face my friends with such a shame fresh upon me it was your me your old man that made life possible when i was by myself through the of the bay of and among the great of the atlantic i began to be able to bear i had myself i thought and when i heard that so far from my wife being guilty of such a shame she actually killed the man that attempted her honor is it any wonder that i felt joyful after a pause asked by il the fate of how did you come to see  to see it why did you take no step to prevent it forgive me old fellow but i want to understand frank went to the rail and leaned over when he came back saw that his eyes were wet with what cheerfulness he could assume he answered on that very night i had made up my mind to try to win back my wife s love i wrote a letter to her a letter in which poured out my whole soul and i left my room to put it under her door so that she would get it in the morning but  here he paused and then said slowly but when in the corridor i saw her door open and at the same moment de appeared did she seem surprised not at first but a moment after a look of amazement crossed her face and she stepped back into the room he following her as he said this he put his head between his hands and groaned and then added his friend and then i hardly know what happened my mind seems full of a dim memory of a blank existence and then a series of wild whirling thoughts something like that last moment after death in s picture i think i must have slept for it was two o clock when i saw and the clock was striking five when i crossed the bridge after i had left the hotel by and the letter what became of it frank started the letter i never thought of it stay i must have left it on the table in my room i remember seeing it there a little while before i came away how was it addressed do not think me inquisitive but i cannot help thinking that that letter may yet be of some great importance frank smiled a sad smile enough as he answered by the pet name i had for  mrs right i used to her because she always defended her position when we argued and so when i wanted to her i called her mrs right was it written on hotel paper no i was going to write on some but i thought it would be better to use the sort we had when  when we were first married there were a few sheets in my writing case so i took one that was headed somewhere in was it not yes near it was a pretty place too called the fell in love with it and made me buy it right away is anyone living there now it is let to i don t think that i heard the name the agent knows when the trouble came i told him to do what he could with it and not to bother me with it any more after by i the fate of a while he wrote and asked if i would mind it being let to a foreigner i told him he might let it to a devil so long as he did not worry me lord paused awhile and asked the next question in a hesitating way he felt embarrassed and showed it tell me one thing more old fellow  if  if you don t mind my dear til tell you anything you like how did you sign the letter s face looked sad as he answered i signed it by another old pet name we both understood we had pet names  people always have when they are first married he added with embarrassment of course murmured the sympathetic one such name lasted a time an old friend of my father s came to see us and in a playful moment he said i was a sad dog took it up and used to call me and i often signed myself frank  as men usually do of course again murmured as if such a signature was a customary thing then he added and on this occasion on this occasion i used the name that seemed full of happiest memories frank may by i i i seem to an but to and myself it might mean much the two men sat silent awhile and then asked softly i suppose it may be taken for granted that lady francis never got the letter i take it it is so but it is no matter now i refused to speak with her just before i met you i did not know then what i know now  and she will never speak to me again he sighed as he spoke and turned away then he went to the rail of the and leaned over with his head down looking into the still blue water beneath him poor old frank said to himself i can t but think that this matter may come right yet i must find out what became of that letter in case lady francis never got it it would prove to her that frank his train of thought suddenly stopped a new idea seemed to strike him so forcibly that it quite upset him who had come over from the rail noticed it i say what is wrong with you	edith-wharton
that you possessed all this information that i have been aching to get hold of thus mr entered upon his story from which it appeared that he knew the root and branch and had dined with them of times what sort of a chap is the asked a very well kept man of with a bow great deal of what is called breeding in his manner and a face like the portrait of a french cut out of a century frame he doesn t look like a business man at all and between ourselves he s not much of a one all the money he ever made saving my apparent was when i was in the concern i ve heard he s got a big on his residence and is going down hill generally too bad nice fellow sorry for him such is life asked if would do him a and particular favor if it would not cause him much trouble and on being answered in the affirmative said he would esteem it a great honor if he could be introduced to mr by that gentleman s former business associate i suppose i shall run across him at some evening he said and get one of those that are the most things in the world i don t want that to happen and the best way to use an elegant phrase is to take the bull by the horns or in this case the sheep by the tail will you make an accidental call on him to morrow afternoon and let me be of the party mr responded that he would be delighted and this matter being settled all parties could give more direct attention to their lunch than they had been doing for the preceding ten minutes you must have heard of my friend in the days when he was a figure on the streets of this town said presently returning to what he knew was the favorite subject of that personage a you ve lived here for twenty years and of course the name of is familiar to you mr looked a good of complete for some seconds and then a gleam as of sudden recollection shot across his face certainly certainly he said mr was what is known as a lady if i am not mistaken you got married did you not mr some ten or eleven years ago the party addressed acknowledged the practical of the date why it comes back as plain as day said the critic a the had a page about you including your portrait and some verses by a well known poet it said your marriage had cast a gloom over island and some of the up river mr gloomily nodded to show that the statement was true then he touched his most portion with a significant look i m a now he said and nothing but this this stands in my way as shakespeare says tis not as deep as a well nor as wide as a church door but the ladies never look at me now and all on account of this d d flesh which hangs like a around my neck s critic the peculiar character of the used remarked politely that he thought no lady of sense would put great stress on such an insignificant matter insignificant echoed i ll bet it s boat thb stake i fifty inches around come and it s not the ladies of sense i m after quite the contrary one of s laughs followed this statement which caused an expression of mild injury to settle over the countenance of mr you re getting on toward forty and you ought to quit said confound the women i let them go that s well enough to talk about replied how would you like to follow your own advice t uttered an exclamation i i have precious little to do with them i assure you for a man of my correct habits i have the worst name of any one i know everybody things about me and they can prove nothing we ll ask about that sneered by the way that wouldn t be a bad place to take young to when you get to him in earnest i met the young fellow on the avenue last night and walked around with him for a couple of hours he s a darling cried both the other gentlemen in one breath to be sure how the women stared at him i couldn t blame them his waist isn t over thirty and he s as handsome as as i was at his age i told him he could have all the loveliness in new york at his feet if he liked smiled significantly at what did he reply to that he asked a black oh he had an ideal in his head and none of those we saw quite came up to it for i did get him to raise his eyes and look at the prettiest ones i drew out of him slowly that he would have nothing to do with a girl unless she had red hair that mr uttered a laugh so hearty that it attracted the attention of everybody in the room mr paused to inquire the cause of this outbreak but assured him that something entirely out of the present discussion had just occurred to him which was to blame for his a girl must have hair repeated mr accepting the explanation or he would not consider her he ruled out all the striking and saying that he liked only those of a medium shade we came across one that answered these descriptions an exquisite little creature who looked as if she would swallow him could she get the chance and then there came out another idea he would not think of this fairy because she was so short i want a woman five feet four inches tall he said as	arthur-conan-doyle

it he went on as if talking to himself but it did no good indeed the first i knew of of miss was by seeing her their marriage bond photograph on his desk he told me her name and said her family lived near his home but nothing further i renewed the subject more than once but made no progress he had plenty of other pictures there women as well as men friends relations all the usual there was nothing to show that he held this one in special regard but the speaker drew a long breath as if he were getting tired i have heard me you mention and i think very likely they are true mr remarked with that in that case mr must be a very happy man messrs and silently indicated that he expressed their own conviction mr looks in wretched health to night doesn t he said mr almost his father and if you watch him you will see how earnestly and anxiously he in that direction all the members of the group followed the suggestion and soon had proof that it was true i wish you would present me to said mr a moment later to mr you will excuse us he added to the others when mr responded that he would do so with pleasure finding that the new acquaintances entered at once into a lively conversation soon left them together and strolled about the house speaking to many persons whom he knew and going almost everywhere in fact except toward the spot where mrs and miss were he paused to hear a sing two pieces which were received with general applause he talked politics for some minutes with a party of men who seemed to have an aversion to feminine society or perhaps it was the feminine part of the gathering that did their marriage bond not care for them so going from one set to another and always finding himself welcome he came gradually to the chair occupied by the senior mr and finding another sat down to have a chat with that gentleman a delightful party he said but then mrs always to have that mr nodded assent she does indeed said he my illness prevents my enjoying these things however as you younger people do i would go home even at this hour except that i feel it a duty to remain the have been my neighbors for twenty years you know and one owes much to appearances his eyes wandered back to the place where mrs and were standing don t you think she looks remarkably well this evening he asked abruptly mr started our hostess yes i had noticed it he answered the elder gave an impatient shrug to his shoulders and at a that followed the motion no no he exclaimed she shines like a star of the first magnitude among all the girls around her oh said himself yes looks very well a glance of suppressed indignation came from the old gentleman there s nothing prettier in all the land he said sharply nor sweeter nor better i have watched her grow from an infant to this day and no flower ever came from shoot to stem from bud to blossom with greater their marriage bond loveliness what a happy man he will be who that flower for his own there was a fascination about the subject that he had determined not to discuss miss with any one again that evening but the opportunity that he could not resist had come to him is is there any one in particular who has that prospect he inquired carelessly looking toward the farther end of the room where a lady was about to play a selection on a piano mr s face brightened for the instant his pains were forgotten and he looked happy i may as well tell you he said in a low tone though you had best not talk with him about it i would rather you did not it has been understood for years between her mother and me when the right time comes she is to be my daughter in law wondered if any of the would notice a strangeness in has countenance to conceal his feelings on most occasions he knew that a close inspection of his face at this moment would excite remark ah he replied i had heard of that possibility so it is arranged mr his chair nearer perhaps i am he said but you are an old friend a much liked friend of my son i ask you again not to speak of this to him unless he first the matter to you i cannot truly say that everything is finally arranged but it to the same thing her mother is satisfied i am satisfied they are

coming he had not noticed he said that mr seemed any worse than he had been for a long time and was about to mention instances where people of his acquaintance had long their expectation when his companion interrupted i indulge in no fancies on that score he said the doctors give me three years at the most i am quite content my are too numerous to make this world worth clinging to i want to

replied faintly i am indeed quite ill tomorrow not to night at her request he then rang for and saw her disappear with the maid chapter xxi do you think my dear probably it is seldom agreeable for a newly wedded groom to be separated from his bride on the night following the ceremony which has in the language f the law made them one in the case of however the disappearance of his wife in the manner just related was a positive relief his do you think my sentiments towards her were of most peculiar order in the first place he could not help feeling a little like a thief who had crept in at a window and was about to rob the house he had married this girl simply because his other means of living had come to an end secondly he was frightened at the transparent purity of her nature so unlike anything with which he had before come into close relations it was ridiculous when he thought of it that he had been the only one of that couple to blush since they had been together was not well her pale cheeks had showed that for months for some reason she had sent for him in spite of this and herself fixed this early date for their was very glad of his twenty four hours at breakfast she came to meet him looking much as usual except that the lack of sleep to which she confessed showed upon her swollen eyelids an account of the marriage had appeared in the papers the had managed to

into the face of his daughter hoping to read there a story which was not on that page everything went agreeably as usual during the day which included a long car young mt giddy drive at the fashionable hour on the most fashionable hundreds of acquaintances bowed to the newly wedded couple who returned the it was remarked on every side that this was an ideal marriage beauty and wealth were hers family was his they were the most envied that day of all the million and a half of new york even the is not permitted to withdraw the curtains that hide some things from the gaze of the curious world it can only be stated that for the week that succeeded mr and mrs lived the life they had contracted to live and this was for a week only on the eighth day mrs complained again of illness and dr was called in it was the opinion of that wise that the new wife required a total absence of all excitement above all she should have undisturbed repose this he communicated as delicately as possible to the husband the wound by saying that the trouble was only a temporary one that would soon pass away not knowing anything better to do the occasion by going to his club and getting very drunk that evening being escorted to his rooms by mr in person at a very late or rather early hour it was the first test of his ability to keep his good resolutions and was disgusted when he awoke in the middle of the day and found how little he had shown his first act was to send word inquiring how his wife had slept and he told the messenger to add that he was himself suffering from a slight when called a do you think my dear few hours later the young man heard the full story of his conduct he had persisted in drinking it appeared in spite of the advice of several of his friends and had at one time become furiously enraged at a harmless steward who took the liberty to make a drink weaker than he thought it should be so disgusted was at this recital that he began to fill up with poison as soon as the went his way and it was a week before he left his rooms in the meantime recovered enough to ride out but not enough to see her husband except at table dr was very grave when but would not say much the also had a solemn look the whole affair wore on until it seemed sometimes as if he would go frantic you ll have me on your hands too if this goes on much longer he said to at the end of a month mr viewed the changed aspect of things with an interested face he told at last that if he were in his place he would take a little run out of town and pull himself together you could go to the hills with your rod and gun he said and no one would find any fault i d speak to your wife about it before the day is over as long as she is under a physician s care she can t object at first protested with vigor that he would do nothing of the kind when his wife was ill he wasn t going to be accused of running into the woods to enjoy himself it would look hard hearted and i there

shore and saw the steamer pull them away bitterest to those who had no friend to watch them go how they clung to england stretched out their hands to her and when they could hold to her no other way they waved their hats and their handkerchiefs to their countrymen who waved to them from shore  and so they spun out a little longer the slender chain that visibly bound them to her and at this moment even the iron hearted and the reckless were soft and sad our hearts roots lie in the soil we have grown on no wonder then c leaned over the ship side with sorrow and counted each foot of water as it glided by and thought now i am so much farther from for a wonder he was not sea sick but bis appetite was gone from a nobler cause he could hardly be persuaded to eat at all for many days the steamer cast off at and the captain made sail and beat down the channel off the a breeze and the crowded all her canvas when sky and all were drawing the men out and and by means of them set sails out several yards clear of the on either side so on she her canvas spread out like an enormous fan or a huge all wings a it is never too late to mend goodly gallant show bat all this vast and swelling an exile s heart of all that ached and beneath that swelling few suffered more than poor george it was his first great sorrow and all so new and strange the ship touched at and then flew southward with the gale many many she sailed and still george hung over the and sadly watched the waves this simple minded honest fellow was not a girl if they had offered to put the ship about and take him back he would not have consented but yet to go on almost broke his heart he was steel and butter his friend the honorable frank was or seemed all steel ho was one of those sanguine spirits that don t admit into their minds the notion of ultimate failure ho was supported too by a natural and whatever most men or at he took as practical jokes played by fortune partly to try his good humor but more to amuse him the poorer passengers suffered much discomfort and the blankets etc stored in s cabin often warmed these two honest hearts as with pitying hands they wrapped them round some shivering off cape a heavy gale came on it lasted thirty six hours and the distress and sufferings of the passengers were terrible an government had allowed a ship to undertake a voyage of twelve thousand miles with a short crew short provisions and just twice as many passengers as could be protected from the weather driven from the deck by the piercing wind and the of water that came on board and crowded into the compass many of these almost died of sickness and air and when in despair they rushed back upon deck horrors ana suffering met them in another shape in vain they huddled together for a little warmth and tried to shield themselves with blankets stretched to the bitter blast cut like a through their and the water rushed in torrents along the deck and crept cold as ice up their bodies as they sat huddled or lay sick and despairing on the hard and tossing wood and whenever a heavier sea than usual struck the ship a despairing scream burst from the women and the good ship groaned and shivered and seemed to share their fears and the blast into their souls i am mighty as fate  as fate and pitiless pitiless pitiless pitiless i pitiless oh then how they longed for a mud cabin or a hole picked with a in some ancient city wall or a or a cart shed in their native but it is an ill wind that blows nobody good this storm raised george s better part of man was not very much afraid to die once when the gave a weather roll that the to the yard arm he said my poor i with a pitying accent not a one but most of the time he was busy crawling on all from one sufferer to another with a drop of brandy in a the wind emptied a glass of the very moisture let alone the liquid in a moment so george would put his bottle to some poor creature s lips and if it was a man he would tell him in his simple way who was stronger than the wind or the sea and that the ship could not go down without his will to the women he whispered that he had just had a word with the captain and he said it was only a gale not a tempest as the passengers fancied and there was no danger none whatever the gale blew itself out and then for an hour or two the ship rolled but at last the angry sea went down the decks were the shook her wet  it is never too late to mend ers and spread her wings again and glided on ner way george felt a little better the storm shook him and roused him and did him good and it was a coincidence in the history of these two lovers that just as under mr s advice was applying the healing of charitable employment to her wound george too was finding a little comfort and life from the

long read which led up to luncheon and had even got so far as to fasten his golden on to his thin high nose when he heard a of gravel and looking over the top of his paper saw mrs coming up the garden walk she was still dressed in the singular costume which offended the sailor s old fashioned notions of propriety but he could not deny as he looked at her that she was a very fine woman in many he had looked upon women of all shades and ages but never upon a more clear cut handsome face nor a more erect and womanly figure he ceased to as he gazed upon her and the frown was smoothed away from his rugged brow may i come in said she herself in the open window with a background of green and  i q beyond the city blue sky i feel like an deep in an enemy s country it is a very welcome invasion ma am said he clearing his throat and pulling at his high collar try this garden chair what is there that i can do for you shall i ring and let mrs know that you are here pray do not trouble admiral i only looked in with reference to our little chat this morning i wish that you would give us your powerful support at our coming meeting for the improvement of the condition of woman no ma am i can t do that he up his lips and shook his head and why not against my principles ma am but why because woman has her duties and man has his i may be old fashioned but that my view why what is the world coming to i was saying to dr only last night that we shall have a woman wanting to command the channel fleet next that is one of the few professions which cannot be improved said mrs with her sweetest smile poor woman must still look to man for protection i don t like these new ideas ma am i tell you honestly that i don t i like discipline and i think every one is the better for it women have got a great deal which they had not in the days of our fathers they have all for themselves i am told and there are women doctors i hear surely they should rest contented what more can they want a naval conquest l l you are a sailor and sailors are if you could see how things really are you would change opinion what are the poor to do there are so many of them and so few to which they can turn their hands but there are hardly any music and drawing there is not one in fifty has any special talent in that direction medicine it is still surrounded with difficulties for women and it takes many years and a small fortune to nursing it is hard work ill paid and none but the strongest can stand it what would you have them do then admiral sit down and starve tut tut it is not so bad as that the pressure is terrible for a lady companion at ten shillings a week which is less than a cook s and see how many answers you get there is no hope no out look for these struggling thousands life is a dull sordid struggle leading down to a cheerless did age yet when we try to bring some httle ray of hope some chance however distant of something better we are told by gentlemen that it is against their principles to help the admiral but shook his head in there is the law government offices the civil service all these  it least should be thrown freely open to women if they have brains enough to successfully for them then if woman were unsuccessful it would be her own fault and the majority of the population of this country could no longer complain that they live under a different law to the and that they are held down in poverty beyond the city and with every road to independence sealed to them what would you propose to do ma am to set the more obvious right and so to the way for a reform now look at that man digging in the field i know him he can neither read nor write he is in and he has as much intelligence as the potatoes that he is digging yet the man has a vote can possibly turn the scale of an election and may help to decide the policy of this empire now to take the nearest example here am i a woman who have had some education who have travelled and who have seen and studied the institutions of many countries i hold considerable property and i pay more in imperial taxes than that man in which is saying a great deal and yet i have no more direct influence upon the disposal of the money which i pay than that fly which along the wall is that right is it fair the admiral moved uneasily in his chair yours is an exceptional case said he but no woman has a voice consider that the women are a majority in the nation yet if there was a question of upon which all the women were agreed upon one side and all the men upon the other it would appear that the matter was settled when more than half the population were opposed to it is that right again the admiral it was very awkward for the gallant seaman to have a handsome woman opposite to him him with questions to none of which he could find an answer couldn t even a naval conquest the out of his guns as he explained the matter to the doctor that evening now those are really the points	edith-wharton

been through a large walled city since the riot at shan and i had to brace myself up for entering this one which has a population of people the inhabitants were very orderly however and though the streets were greatly crowded the people looked pleasant the shan riot is known to all the and obviously they have no wish for a repetition of it and i to my belief that they are in most if not in all cases able to prevent attacks on foreigners is a clean and prosperous looking city with wide streets lined by good shops in which the goods are more displayed than is usual it is surrounded with well cultivated country and good country houses and trades in vegetable and raw and spun silk some of the strong coarse oak silk being brought in for manufacture oil is made from the seeds of the seed nuts and seed oil bears the highest price the town has a stirring aspect and its walls and are in good repair outside the river is crossed by a noble stone bridge of nine arches with fine stone carrying a eighteen feet broad the centre arch is thirty feet high it is the finest bridge that i had then seen in china a grand temple outside the walls and an carved triple pat complete the attractions of this

and there so far as the evidence went was an end to the strange tenant of the silent house link the charged with the conduct of the case confessed as much to i do not see the slightest chance of tracing s past said he to the we are as ignorant about him as we are of the name of the are you sure there is no clue mr link absolutely none even the weapon with which the crime was committed cannot be found you have searched the house every inch of it and with the result that i have found nothing the surroundings of the case are most mysterious if we do not identify the dead we hope to trace the murderer how the wretch got into the house is more than i can discover it is strange admitted thoughtfully yet in some secret way people were in the habit of entering the house and knew as much not only that but he protected them from curiosity by denying that they even existed i don t quite follow you mr i allude to the shadows on the blind which i saw myself a week before the murder took place they were those of a man and a woman and must have been cast by bodies of flesh and blood therefore two people must have been in s sitting room on that night yet when i met  the silent house who was absent at the time  he denied that anyone could have entered his house without his knowledge more he actually insisted that i should satisfy myself as to the truth of this by examining the house which you did yes but found nothing yet said with an air of conviction however the man and woman entered they were in the house then the must have come in by the same way but where that way can be or how it can be found is more than i can say does the landlord know of any secret passages no i asked him replied the but he stated that houses nowadays were not built with secret passages when denied that anyone was in the house was he afraid mr yes he seemed to be nervous and he told you he had enemies he hinted that there were people who wished to see him dead from the way he spoke and the language he used i am satisfied that he was hiding from the vengeance of some one vengeance repeated link raising his eyebrows is not that word a trifle perhaps but to my mind there is more in actual life than people fancy however mr link added i have come to certain conclusions that was in hiding secondly that he saw people secretly who entered in the silent house some way we cannot discover and that to solve the problem it will be necessary to look into the past life of the dead man your third conclusion brings us round to the point whence we started retorted link how am i to discover the man s past by learning who he is and what is his real name an easy task said the considering the meagre material upon we have to work and how is the business to be accomplished by advertisement advertisement yes i wonder the idea did not strike you before seeing how often it is used in similar cases a full description of the man who called himself note his physical peculiarities and looks and such description by means of and newspapers link looked angry and laughed rather contemptuously as his professional pride was touched by the fact of being advised by an individual not of his calling i am not so ignorant of my business as you think he said sharply what you suggest has already been done there are describing the appearance of in every police office in the kingdom in the newspapers also asked by the s tone the silent house no it is not necessary i don t agree with you many people in private life are not likely to see your i don t pretend to advise mr link he added in soothing tones but would it not be wise to use the medium of the daily papers i ll think of it said link too jealous of his dignity to give way at once oh i quite rely on your discretion said hastily you know your own business best but if you succeed in will you let me know link looked keenly at the young man why do you wish to know about the matter he asked out of simple curiosity the case is so mysterious that i should like to watch you it well said link rather gratified by this tribute to his power i shall indulge your fancy the result of this conversation was that observed in the newspapers next day an advertisement describing the looks and name and physical peculiarities of the deceased with special mention of the loss of the left hand s little finger and the strange on the right cheek satisfied that the only way to learn the truth had been adopted by the authorities impatiently waited for the development of the scheme within the week he received a visit from the you were right and i was wrong mr the silent house admitted link generously the newspapers were of more use than the yesterday i received a letter from a lady who is coming to see me to morrow at my office so if you care to be present at the interview you have only to say so i should like it above all things said eagerly who is the lady a mrs who writes from bath can she identify the dead man she thinks she can but of

most ordinary common thing in the world had happened what more natural than that her brother having failed she should be summoned by her aunt to supply his deficiency what more likely than that she

a happy infancy and childhood your pardon mr observed gently i did indeed smile but it was at the idea of a lad of your parts beginning existence amid such humble surroundings but for my education i might have also of their lot replied with a smile i had no claim to a higher position save in the imagination of my poor father who always cherished the dream that he came of a noble house and exchanged glances and the former opened his mouth as if to question the young man but his mind he made no remark and signed to him to continue his tale ignorant of this by play whose eyes were fixed

part of the state of van is a wilderness there was no better reason why it should have been received into the union than that a few ambitious desired to enter by that door the mines which the late had

back long after midnight and retired to rest never knew margaret read her friends she saw the sturdy faithful could hold her tongue and could not yet i am not sure she would have trusted even had her nerve equalled her spirit but with all her daring and resolution she was a tender timid woman a little afraid of the dark very afraid of alone in it and desperately afraid of wolves now could kill a wolf in a brace of shakes but then would not go with her but only with so altogether she made one the next night they made another moonlight and as i think with some result for not the next night it rained that night and extinguished their courage but the next after they took with them a companion the last in the world would have thought of jet she gave her warm approval as soon as she was told be was to go with them imagine how these stealthy trembled and panted when the moment of action came the and the hearth imagine if you can the in breast the thrilling hopes chasing and by sickening

his seclusion my reader is aware that the moment the of his passion passed he was seized with remorse for having been betrayed into it but perhaps only those who have risen as high in religious spirit as he had and suddenly fallen can realize the terror at himself that took possession of him he felt like one whom self confidence bad to the very edge of a precipice ah good he cried how much better you knew me than i knew myself how bitter yet wholesome was your v accustomed to search his own heart he saw at once that the true cause of his fury was margaret i love her then better than god said he better than the church from such a love what can spring to me or to her he shuddered at the let the strong battle temptation tis for the weak to flee and who is weaker than i have shown myself what is my my religion a pack of cards built by degrees into a fair seeming structure and lo one breath of earthly love and it lies in the dust i must begin again and on a foundation he resolved to leave holland at once and spend years of his life in some distant before returning to it by that time the temptations of earthly passion would be doubly baffled an older and a better he should be more master of his earthly affections and margaret seeing herself abandoned would marry and love another the very anguish this last thought cost him showed the self and self that be was on the path of religious duty b t in leaving her for his immortal good and era he was not to neglect her indeed the sweet thought he could make her comfortable for life and rich in this world s goods which she was not bound to despise sustained him in the bitter struggle it cost him to turn his back on her without one kind word or look oh what will she think of me he groaned shall i not seem to her of all creatures the most heartless but so best ay better she should me miserable that i am heaven is and my broken heart this comfort i can make that villain restore her own and she shall never lose another

the most interesting fascinating and startling see and die i would almost say and yet i can give no idea of au that has taken such a strong hold of me i should now be quite content to see only the manifold street life with its crowds and din and the strange and ever shifting water life altogether distinct from the land life the rice paper pictures give a very good idea of the forms and colours of the boats but the thousands letter iv and boats of them and the rate at which they are are altogether indescribable either by pen or pencil there are with big eyes on either side of the stem without which they could not see their way and with open bows with two six grinning through them along the sides there are ten guns and at the lofty square quaint broad carved stem two more this heavy is carried for protection against but its chief use is for the production of those noises which delight in on all occasions in these helpless and looking vessels which are sailed with an amount of noise and apparent confusion which is absolutely shocking to any one used to our strict discipline the projects six feet and more the are single poles the large sails of fine and what with their antique shape rich colouring work and carving they are the most picturesque craft afloat then there are passage boats from the whole interior of rivers and each district having its special and at once by the these sail when they can and when they can t are by large sweeps each of which is worked by six men who stand on a platform outside these boats are always heavily laden crowded with passengers and armed to the teeth as a protection against river and they carry of from to fifty men at some distance below there are of large two house boats with entrance doors seven feet high always open and of rich wood carving through which the can be seen with their richly decorated innumerable coloured lamps chairs and of carved with white marble let these eyes are really charms but the above is the explanation given to the golden iv into the seats and backs embroidered silk gilded and and all the of chinese luxury many of them have gardens on their roofs these are called flower boats and are of noisy and evil reputation then there are of three comfortable house boats to let to people who make their homes on the water in summer to avoid the heat marriage boats green and gold with much wood carving and flags and of all kinds river with their large eyes and carved and stems lying in rows duck boats with their noisy inmates boats with of growing plants for sale two boats or with glass sides floating hotels in which evening are given with much and noise boats much gilded from which proceeds an incessant beating of washing boats market boats floating shops which supply the floating population with all country boats of fantastic form coming down on every wind and tide and of all boats looking like big shoes which are in and out among all the heavier craft by standing in the stem one of the most marvellous features of is the city of house boats floating and stationary in which about a quarter of a million people live and it may with truth be added are born and die this population is quite distinct in race from the land population of which looks down upon it as a and alien caste these house boats some of which have a single circular roof others two roofs of different heights and which include several thousand of the marvellous boats lie in along the river sides and packed closely stem and stem along the forming bustling and picturesque water streets many of the boats on the letter iv afloat are floating shops and do a brisk trade one end of the boat being the shop the other the dwelling house as the boats are only from fifteen to twenty feet long it may be imagined as their breadth is strictly that the accommodation for a family is rather yet such a boat is not only the home of a married pair and their children but of the eldest son with his wife and children and not of also the roofs slide in a sort of fashion and the whole interior space can be enclosed and divided the bow of the boat whether large or small is always the family house and the water is at night with the melancholy glimmer fainter though than a glow worm s light of thousands of burning sticks making the air heavy with the of incense unlike the houses of the poor on shore the house boats are models of cleanliness and space is and by more ingenious than those of a tiny these boats which form neat rooms with seats by day turn into beds at night and the children have separate rooms the men go on shore during the day and do s work but the women seldom land are devoted to duties and besides are to be seen at all hours of day and night flying over the water for hire at the and goods and passengers as strong as men and clean comely and pleasant looking one at the stern and one at the bow sending the floating home along with skilled and sturdy strokes they are splendid boat women and not these women don t their feet their dress is dark brown or blue cotton and consists of wide trousers and a short loose upper garment up to the throat the feet are big and bare the hair is neat and drawn back from the face into a stiff roll or and they all wear stone you see the golden n a woman cooking or	walt-whitman
powers but why on earth didn t she telegraph to you well you know how old fashioned and she is sir she makes out through the  how i cannot tell you  that the telegraph is a sinful institution therefore it is not to be wondered at that she trusted the mystery to the post i got her letter only this morning as of course it followed me on from nevertheless i knew about the loss of the key last night ah the loss of the key yes go on very well brown being allowed to remain in my house proceeded to make himself quite at home in the library mrs writing her letter  no easy task for her  took no further heed of him he was in the room for quite an hour and amused himself it appears in breaking open my desk having forced several of the drawers he found at last the one he wanted  the one containing the key of the vault then he made all things beautifully smooth so that mrs should not see they had been with and leaving a message that he would return to dinner went out  for a walk he returned it appears to his lodging and left there again about nine o clock in the evening since then nothing has been seen or heard of him god bless me are you sure he has the key positive i looked in my desk last night and it was not there but everything was done so nicely that i am strongly of the opinion that mr brown has served his as a and that under a the missing key pretty good master too no one but he could have stolen that key besides the letter shows plainly that he came to the farm with no honest intentions but what i can t understand continued biting his is how the man came to know where the key was yes that is extraordinary undoubtedly he it was who stole the body and gained access to the vault with your key but the murder of dr he committed that too i am convinced of it called to see him found he was out and i have no doubt followed him he probably saw brown remove the body and of course interfered upon which the villain made short work of him that is my theory sir and a very sound one too in many respects said the but brown could not have removed the body alone he must have had an true and it is for that very reason i am going to town this afternoon may be able to supply some information on that point it is quite possible he slept in the churchyard and saw the whole business  murder and all cried mr do you ve this murder was committed the mystery on the sacred soil of the churchyard in god s own acre no one surely could be so vile i do sir and at the door of the vault brown as you say yourself cleverly concealed the body in s coffin he had no time to screw it down again apparently he must have had a pretty tough job to cut through that lead he had to trust to chance of course that the vault would not be visited until he had got a safe distance away with his and indeed but for s letter no one would ever have thought of going there in fact this brown is a most ingenious and dangerous criminal he is indeed he is but what could he possibly want the body for ha that s just it i fancy this is a case of if you remember a s body was stolen in america some few years ago and only restored to the family on payment by them of a very large sum of money oh that is what you think he is after yes i do it is highly probable i think that in a few weeks or perhaps even in less time we shall receive a letter demanding some thousands for the return of the body but surely the police h mr brown will look after all that you may depend upon it he ll make himself the missing key quite safe before he goes that far so a gentleman as he would not be likely to omit all necessary precautions of that kind muttered mr considering and of mrs s suspicious flight what think you i confess i don t know quite what to make of that i have no great opinion of her as a woman still i should hardly credit her with being in league with this no indeed for that she must needs be the worst of women said mr with warmth why poor was simply crazy about her he worked day and night to provide her with the finery she for besides she seemed really fond of him who was she asked well i shouldn t like to say it to every one but mrs had been an an under what name that i cannot tell you i called there one day and i heard her shakespeare her seemed to me so fine that i her upon it then she told me that she had been on the stage and had retired when she married that s very strange i always thought she had somewhat of a professional manner about her the mystery and her hair  yellow hair not that i mean for one moment she was what the referred to by these words well my boy what is to be done now i am going up to london in an hour s time glanced at his watch while speaking but you ll miss seeing the remonstrated mr i ll see him when i return you can explain the case as well as i sir i shall bring back with me	mark-twain
the was at the piano and thither repaired but mrs ward seated near the fire called to her side i must introduce you lord  mr train the grandfather of george was a huge man red faced white haired and with a rather expression he was over seventy yet carried his years like a boy under his white eyebrows he shot a quick glance at from a pair of keen gray eyes and him up at once as a fool but lord had been a many years before and knew that even fools are sometimes useful moreover he had learned from mrs ward s chatter that train was a great friend of s and he knew more about george than george thought however after that one glance of contempt was very civil to i am glad to meet you he said with a nod you go in for books i understand from mrs ward he had a deep voice like that of an early and spoke in an abrupt kind of way train who stood before him uke a rabbit before a snake compared him in his own mind with sharp s friend the of was quite as wicked and savage and as that celebrated nobleman i do write a little said nervously i believe in action rather than in writing said there are far too many books written all of you dreams may come true and when they do come true what is the use of them in my young days we lived now people dream clever mrs ward i m sure there s no dreaming about society nowadays said mrs ward laughing is as sharp as a needle to get the better of his or her neighbor mutual deception society said you give me so much and i ll let you go so far that s the sort of thing but there is a great deal of nowadays and what good does do mr train said only makes people lazy people are too sentimental i would give half these the cat if i had my way train was quite sure that he would for with his red face and heavy and savage air of command he looked the picture of a roman emperor had the instincts of a and could imagine him and burning and doing all manner of evil things he wondered how ever came to have such a grandfather it was on the tip of his tongue to say something about just to observe the effect on but his courage failed him and he held his peace and at that moment fate the drawing room door opened and a servant announced mr the next moment george came face to face with his grandfather chapter x it was a most awkward meeting train and knew the truth but mrs ward and were ignorant as to lord himself was not sure after his conversation with he had a vague idea that since was connected in some way with his grandfather lord must have somehow learned that was the name his had taken there was no other way of for the mention of s name by the private inquiry agent however this might be lord was too clever a man to betray himself george felt that the old man knew who he was but he could not be sure for welcomed him with a air as he would have done a stranger mrs ward watched the meeting curiously and noticed her inquiring gaze but he put this down to his knowledge that knew he was a for s hand and wished the girl to marry was the only person in the room who displayed any visible disturbance he grew red and restless was perfectly calm how delightful of you to come mr said mrs ward rising and apparently forgetting that she had forbidden him the house i must introduce you lord mr and you know mr train we are old friends said george calmly miss ward  he bowed to who his serenity although she felt anxious but when she saw her lover s composure she knew that nothing disagreeable would occur and her apprehensions were relieved there ensued a general conversation relative to the weather to the doings of a certain and to sundry other subjects more or less vague george talked and was conscious that was listening with approval again and again he wondered if the old man really knew who he was and again and again he failed to arrive at any conclusion after a time went with to the piano where she played for his and mrs ward seized the opportunity to show some new photographs of herself and were practically alone and the old lord appeared anxious to make himself agreeable george was watchful for the but it did not peep out tyrant as was yet he could play the part of a highly bred polished gentleman of the old school to perfection he did so on this occasion i have heard of you from mrs ward he said in his harsh tones which no amount of politeness could render agreeable but i do not think we have met before no recall any meeting replied george wondering if the other was about to hint that he had seen some one resembling him i have seen you in the distance however distance enchantment to the view in my case you are pleased to say so lord i generally do say what i please responded the old man shooting a sharp glance at george the yellow are you related to the of no i have not that on chuckled

mortals he cried there is nothing that could prevent my the clergyman and securing the prize i desire mr h m and in the meanwhile what would become of your great novel this question brought a sober pause to the young i could write it after my wedding he answered finally could you you could write nothing at all then nothing that any one would pay a cent to read i have told you from the start that what you want is a grand passion something to stir your soul to its depths you are on the verge of that experience already you have had a glimpse of what it will be like for the first time the touch of a woman s fingers has driven sleep from your eyelids no you didn t tell me you laid awake all night but i saw it by looking at you you can shut yourself up in your room now and over the dear face the lovely mouth the soft voice of your beloved in another week if this keeps on you can write like a combination of george after she met and before her marriage a month later might over your productions for you will be on the of bliss oh so many many maids a slight laugh at his own excess of description issued from the lips of mr but the countenance of his companion was as firm as a rock you are right said gravely already i see the vast difference between this sensation of love and the thing i imagined it to be when i wrote those silly pages that did so well to reject but i am torn between two desires i want to write my novel until yesterday i thought no wish could be so great and i also want my wife he breathed the word with a simple reverence that affected even the heart of his i shall never rest easy until i find her wholly mine to love honor and cherish while god gives me breath the hand of the elder man dropped heavily on the table by his side good he exclaimed very good you could not have said it better there is an opportunity before you to accomplish both of these things i only wish to impress upon you the fact that they must come in the order i have indicated or one of them will never come at all write your story while the fever of passion is on you the dead calm of married life would only bring the sort of novel that the shelves are already piled with to the public and a in the hands of the doubted the full of these conclusions he thought with that dear girl by his side he could write with all the of a sweetheart for his affection was to have no boundary no limit no end but he had a high opinion of the a black abilities of mr and he had no idea of ing the conclusions of that wise guide do you think she will accept me he asked wistfully returning to the main question it came so sudden and there was very little said and it was late and then came after her and she went into the house everything was left in a state of uncertainty did nothing show whether you were indifferent to her was the that followed usually i believe something the sweet word hope to the waiting one and what do you say about that he came to call your and took her away from you without reserve the young man repeated what had happened seemed deeply interested but whatever his thoughts he did not express them at the time and that reminds me of another thing said have you noticed anything strange about mr yes said mr i have noticed i wondered if you had done the same have you discovered what the trouble is no and doesn t know either indeed she is much distressed about it remember this is a secret between us for perhaps i had no right to talk of their affairs he is in a state of great depression and as he it so regular in his habits i can t imagine what to lay it to you are so shrewd couldn t you find out oh many maid mr rose and took a few paces up and down the room you are the fellow to do that not i he said presently yes hear me out you are in a sense a member of his family and would have a natural right to allude to the state of his health then if you were to put in a word about miss why you might kill several birds with one stone looked much puzzled i thought he said that you wanted me to the matter of my marriage as long as possible your marriage yes but not the they may require a dozen with the ld gentleman the first time he will probably laugh you out of the room as a silly young the second he will say that he has nothing against you personally but that his baby is too to think of such things for ten years yet the third he will begin to see the situation in its right light and after that it will be only a matter of detail all these things will be of the greatest value to you in the novel you are going to write and you must not on your life miss a single one of them drop into the wool shop catch his royal there and for the first thing express solicitude for his health unless he is on his guard more than is likely you ought to catch some slight straw to show what him then follow it up with a word or two about miss and you will have spent a good afternoon even if he	arthur-conan-doyle

possible to urge the setting of a definite date this was during the month of august when she was with him at the grand union but this the girl could not be persuaded to do her health she said and dr her statement was very irregular on monday she might be as red as a rose and on the following thursday as pale as a water lily her father she reminded him had secured her consent to the engagement by the express that he would ask no haste to this the protested that he had no intention to push matters if a date was only agreed upon and announced even if it was as late as november or december he would be quite content once when he had argued with her on this point longer than usual and perhaps with more warmth she burst into tears and he was in a state of distress he went to mr and revealed what had taken place and the agreed with him very unwillingly that nothing more could be done at present then when no one expected it there came a sudden change within two weeks from the day had declared that the next december would be a too early date for her wedding she came to her father of her own accord and told him she was ready to obey his wishes he began to protest that he had entirely altered his mind and to admit that her health was not good enough but she stopped him she had thought it all over and he was right lit young miss she wanted to be married and without unnecessary delay in october no in september as early in the month as possible and she did not want a formal wedding either she wished the kind of a ceremony indulgent as had always been with his daughter it was some time before he could himself to consent to this arrangement he had imagined the finest wedding that new york had ever seen such as might the of millions followed by a reception to which all of the upper ten thousand would be obliged to come the of the bridegroom if not the wealth of the bride would have filled his palace with representatives of the first families of the country the wedding day would have been the he had ever known since he walked out of his father s with all his worldly goods in a small under his arm but was accustomed to having her way and he could do nothing with her she would be married quietly and she would not be married any other way have you consulted mr asked the in desperation are you certain he is willing to dispense with all on such a momentous occasion mr said turning slightly paler regards this matter too much in the light of a business venture to hold any opinions contrary to mine mr s cheek also lost its color as he heard these words you wrong him he began he loves you he will do as i wish she interrupted as if weary of the conversation i have written to him he will arrive to night do not put any obstacles in our way quiet are not that s a good papa say no more about it the natural place for the to go with such a matter was to the office of mr david and he repaired thither with miss had however anticipated this move and prepared the for it after hearing as if for the first time the news which the brought mr affected an attitude of deep interest and into silent meditation for several minutes emerging at last he gave it as his opinion that the young lady was the one most interested and that it would be unwise to attempt to control her actions the ill health of the bride would answer all questions as to the reason for leaving the beaten paths when mr left his adviser he went straight to and told her he would do as she wished mr had become quite used to being engaged the more he had seen of his the better he had learned to like her he had come to an early conclusion that she would not be the most disagreeable woman in the world he believed he could endure a good deal of that pretty face that sweet voice those delicate ways he had had his time at wild living why not settle down into a model home loving husband he would have wealth enough in all conscience not a bad thing to consider she would not be likely to hold him by a severe chain like a woman who was all passion he could still belong to his clubs and get an occasional evening with the boys so as not to break off everything too suddenly young miss he used to think of these things as he came and went that spring and summer to pay her irregular visits but when he received word that his time had come he had a brief fright like a prisoner who is aroused from sleep and told that the is prepared miss s letter was not in the least it seemed the height of frankness a quality that he admired above all others in her you have left the date of our marriage to me she said in effect and i have postponed it in the hope that i should fully recover my health before giving myself to you that hope grows no more likely to be realized as the time passes away i have therefore concluded that we had best wait no longer as soon as you are ready i will be your wife under the circumstances however a public wedding and reception seem to me from this she

must do something what what what he went into a hotel and wrote the letter he had decided upon he walked after that through streets with the fearful question till the clock struck ten then he saw a carriage standing in front of a handsome residence and a man being forced down the steps and heard a cry for help where risk death chapter where women risk death seeking to find some relief from his own depression as well as from the constant strain which his meetings with now put upon him engaged the services of a guide and spent considerable time the parts of london into which the ordinary is not supposed to penetrate it is said that no one person knows the whole of that vast but this man came as near it as any one could he was a veritable of everything within ten miles of st paul s cathedral having made it a business to show strangers about ever since he was a very young man as had his father before him there s a house the business of which you would not be likely to suspect from the appearance of the exterior he said one day as they passed a handsome residence within a stone s throw of pall few of those who live in the neighborhood imagine what goes on within those quiet then he whispered the secret to who opened his eyes with astonishment and inquired why the police permitted such places to exist so openly rt they regard them as necessities responded the guide it is considered better that something of this kind should be allowed than that respectable families should find their names dragged in the mud i could though of course i would not give you th names of some ladies of the who hare been here here comes a carriage if we walk slowly we may see something a veiled lady alighted who gave directions to her driver to return in an hour and then silently vanished into the residence a little more careful than most of them commented the guide she is wise enough to her face was a good deal shocked but does not death sometimes p he asked y e s was the slow answer

encountered he wondered if the lady who had just disappeared within those doors would be added to that horrible list of those who never came out alive he thought of that coachman waiting in vain hour after hour until a messenger came down the steps to say that he might go and he tried to think what report he would make to his master cruel heartless london in nothing had it seemed so terrible as in this den with its fair and shining front exposed to the smiling crowds who passed hour by hour never thinking of the within he did not know that every large city of his own america had just such places and that fortunes art by the doctors who this trade he had never the published every day by great newspapers which in their literary hold up their hands at books like thou shalt not and in s shadow he had never the books in the counting rooms of these journals showing sometimes as high as a hundred dollars a day thirty thousand dollars a year received from making the virtuous gentlemen

several evenings later in its vicinity as one where men have been or where have dashed their brains out on the pavement he marked the elegance of most of the carriages that came and went and the aristocratic bearing of the ladies who were the of the institutions occasionally a common cab was of the but it was conspicuous for its ordinary appearance and its driver usually drove off as soon as

something about the walk of the lady something about her figure that was strangely familiar he felt assured that he had seen her before but he could not at first tell anything more definite it must be merely a fancy he did not know personally ten women in england and how could he recognize this one out of all the throng that filled the vast city the lady disappeared at the and the door closed

solved much easier where the lived than in boston as there was but one hotel in could not very well avoid running across about the first thing he did neither of the men was glad to see the other there for each felt that his movements would now have to be to some extent suspected from the first the real nature of s errand and saw that it was likely to interfere with his visits to mrs he could not however have imagined the extent to which the lover would go in his desire to remove from his path he could not foresee that he would make the acquaintance of miss and pour into her too willing ear under the promise to conceal the name of her all that he knew pr guessed about s visits to miss thought at first of telling him the truth hoping that it would his stay but in order to do this it might be necessary to explain some things about which he did not care to be in this way several weeks went by during which the two men became a constant nuisance to each other they had to pretend friendship when they met and they played a game of together once in a while but neither was in the least deceived soon found out what he came to learn and had the additional satisfaction of getting aunt to help him in his work he might have left husband you know town then except for his wish to watch whose presence there troubled him not a little he went to boston each saturday not liking to miss seeing the object of his adoration on sunday evening but he always returned on the monday morning train had it not been for this brief might have had the unpleasant experience of living in that dull village week after week without even speaking to the woman whose presence chained him there when she asked him why he did not call oftener he made replies which caused her no little distress he had always seemed so frank about everything that the least symptom of hesitation gave her much uneasiness she assigned every reason but the right one to his changed manner and the situation grew very unpleasant for them both miss was not as may be imagined willing to leave in ignorance of what she had learned when declined to do anything but wait until her husband came home her aunt paid an immediate visit to the office of the village lawyer mr and directed him to draw up without delay a new will for her brother the lawyer knew the well enough to be sure that would sign anything that his sister told him to and readily promised to set about the work at once he was rather than usual that week however and miss got quite uneasy has said anything more to you about the new will she asked her brother when

stage right and never in england till a play obtained and played elsewhere might have been stopped because this was in nor could a rival with safety a printed play but any theatre could play a play once printed this defect in literary property lost us the true text of and also the text of two hundred good plays at least the eighth having ascertained the fact but not at that time the he learned it before his death he the lost plays with indifference and arguing backwards very naturally they were of no great value but alas we who have the clue know better the better the play the less likely were the to let it escape into print no poet s work unless he was a was safe if had sold his plays out and out to a theatre we should have lost many of them we e lost one or two what has become of love s labour s philip was a he began with from that to but in the year finding the drama the best trade going he got hold of a theatre the rose and instead of it to a company per this but cunning made the pay him a large portion of the gross not the profits of each night s performance by this means he received every year in the shape of interest a sum little short of his whole the same move has been played in my day in the is immortal of his from to he has left no record but from that year we possess his until nearly every page of it contains some valuable and unexpected revelation the very monstrous as it looks to the eye at times the of our ancestors a he puts down inter every night s performance what it brought him in and the prices the paid through him to the poets who sold their pieces out and out his show that this company did business with thirty living besides playing some plays that had become public property apparently i have by mr s index attached and count as many as two hundred and eighty plays played at s theatre of these plays on a rough calculation i think under thirty are the calculation to one good man i find that one of s poets and of merit produced

high in a list that contained s name and describes him thus monday our best but s ve him to be one of the writers that sold their plays and to be always poor and wanting advances and therefore at the mercy of the i dare not flatter the reader that less than a thousand original plays were produced and lost in sixteen theatres between and and among them many mr must be of the same mind for he sums up the loss of early plays in these words the very few plays that have come down to us compared with the immense number lost  note to s the real truth is now visible and to the best of my belief has never been so clearly explained as it ought that france in the th century published many five act plays but played very few of them that england produced plays with a which has never been equalled in any age or nation and played them with no scenery but with more gorgeous and costly dresses than now and with great beauty and propriety of action and delivery but rarely printed them now if one of our had lived in what would he have said he would certainly have said the french are poetical by nature witness the and and their the romance writers in verse and etc etc but the drama the acting drama is not in them we english are born look i there are eight theatres in this city so much smaller than paris and all of them full and two good new plays out every week what genius i what france will never have such a drama as ours never can the eighth now drop and inspect the be n with france hers was little better than an honour market who did not write till about is said by the to have been the first who received for his pieces probably he was not the first no man with a name ever is the first in such matters but doubtless nearly the first and until the and b r nice of p no french author received a equivalent from the theatre but in england it was a money market from about prices steadily increasing up to i am not talking of the precarious of princes such as the five hundred crowns to and the more numerous presents bestowed by the princes of the house of on english writers capricious gifts are a curse they are given not to the best pen but the tongue and the i am talking

impression of possessing the normal amount of strength and of being a man of force and determination his countenance bore lines of care already as if he had found life a serious matter and showed a vivid contrast to both the others who gave equal evidence of having passed their youth in contentment and ease his garments were as plain as possible he almost entirely and he had a hesitation in speech that reminded one of an girl most strangers if invited to guess would have set him down as an clergyman or at least a professor but he was in reality a lawyer who was already making a name at

many yards hope found a lamp that had been dropped by some who had rushed into the hall as the first warning came hope extinguished the light and gave it to grace that will be twenty four hours light to us said he but oh what i want to find is food there must be some left behind papa said grace i think i saw a throw a bag into an empty when the first alarm was given back back my child cried hope before that villain finds it he did not wait for her but ran back and he found ben in the neighborhood of that very but off at his approach hope looking into the found treasures  a dozen new a heavy hammer a small bag of nails a can of tea and a bag with a loaf in it and several broken pieces of bread he put his lamp out directly for he had matches in his pocket and he hid the bag of bread then he lighted his lamp again and fastened it up by a nail in the centre of the hall there said he to that s to light us both equally when it goes out you must hang up yours in its place that s fair said humbly there were two on hope s side of the hall  the empty one in question and one that was full of coal both stood about two yards from hope s side of the hall hope turned the empty and brought it parallel to the other then he nailed two together and fastened them to the coal and the then he laid upon the ground for grace to lie on and he kept two for himself and two in reserve and he took two and threw them to ben i give you two and i keep two myself said he but my daughter shall have a room to herself even by a perilous secret here and if yoa her fu brain you with this hammer i don t want to her said it ain t my fault she s here then there was a gloomy silence and well there might be the one lamp twinkling faintly against the wall did but make darkness visible and revealed the horror of this dismal scene the weary hours began to crawl away marked only by hope s watch for in this living tomb summer was winter and day was night the horrors of in a mine have we think been described better than any other calamity which living men inspired by this subject have gone beyond themselves have gone beyond themselves and without any affectation we say we do not think we could go through the dismal scene before us in its general details without falling below many gifted and adding bulk without value to their descriptions the true characteristic feature of this sad scene was not we think the of hope and despair nor the gradual sinking of frames exhausted by hunger and thirst but the circumstance that here an and his victims were involved in one terrible calamity and as one day succeeded to another and the hoped for rescue came not the hatred of the and his victims was sometimes at odds with the fellowship that sprang out of a joint calamity about twelve hours after the explosion detected hope and his daughter eating and their lips with the tea and a of brandy that hope had poured into it out of his to keep it from turning sour what haven t you a morsel for me said the in a piteous voice hope gave a sort of of contempt but still he flung a crust to him as he would to a dog then after some slight hesitation grace rose quietly and took the smaller can and filled it with tea and took it across to him there said she and may god forgive you he took it and stared at her it ain t my fault that you are here said he but she put up her hand as much as to say no idle words two whole days had now elapsed the food though was all gone s lamp was flickering and utter darkness was about to be added to the horrors which were now beginning to chill the hopes with which these poor souls had entered on their dire hope took the alarm seized the lamp trimmed it and carried it down the one passage that was open this time he did not confine his to the part where he could stand upright but went on his hands and knees down the working at the end of it he gave a shout of triumph and in a few minutes returned to his daughter exhausted and blackened all over with coal but the lamp was now burning brightly in his hand and round his neck was tied a can of oil oh ray poor father said grace is that all you have discovered thank god for it said hope you little know what it would be to pass two more days here without light as well as without food the next day was terrible the violent pangs of hunger began to like and the thirst was still more intolerable the pangs of hunger for hours at a time and then returned to again they exhausted but did not but the rage of thirst became incessant and ben suffered the most from this and the wretch came to hope for consolation where s the sense of here by a perilous secret said he to be burned to wi let s flood the mine and drink or be how can i flood the mine said hope know best said the man why how many tons of water did ye draw from yon every day we conduct about five tons into a pit and we send about five tons up to the surface daily	jane-austen

him to combat  and there seemed also to be judging from sundry passed over the table and passed under it an understanding to which he and the genial gentleman who occasionally were parties as the school master his coffee the genial gentleman who occasionally broke the silence i missed you at the concert last night mr idiot said he yes said the idiot with a caressing movement of the hand over his upper lip i was very sorry but i couldn t get around last night i had an engagement with a number of friends at the club i g meant to have dropped you a line in the afternoon telling you about it but i forgot it until it was too late was the concert a success  very successful indeed the best one in fact we have had this season which makes me regret all the more deeply your absence returned the genial gentleman with a suggestion of a smile playing about his lips indeed he added it was the finest one i ve ever seen the finest one you ve what the school master startled at the the finest one i ve ever seen replied the genial gentleman there were only ten and really in all my experience as an attendant at i never saw such a magnificent rendering of as we had last night i wish you could have been there it was a sight for the gods i don t believe said the idiot with a slight cough that may have been intended to conceal a laugh  and that may also have been the result of too many  i don t believe it could have been any more interesting than a game of pool i heard at the club it appears to me said the to the school master that the sounds we heard late last night in the idiot s room may have some connection with the present mode of speech these two gentlemen affect s hear them out returned the school master and then we ll take them into camp as the idiot would say i don t know about that replied the genial gentleman i ve seen a great many and i ve heard a great many good games of pool but the concert last night was simply a spectacle we had a there who played the of the first act of with surprising as far as i could see he didn t miss a note though it was a little to observe how he used the too forcibly or how the idiot not forcibly enough returned the he tried to work them both with one foot it was the only thing to mar an otherwise marvellous performance the idea of a man trying to display with two hands and one foot is to a with a trained eye i wish the doctor would come down said mrs anxiously yes put in the school master there seems to be madness in our midst well what can you expect of a anyhow the idiot the like the or the italian or the african hasn t the

whose diet was entirely confined to because they were too tired to it is the ease with which it can be absorbed that makes the favorite dish of the and the fondness of all latin races for is entirely

witness as yourself it was too bad but we made up for it later asserted the other there was a young girl there who gave us some of s songs without words her expression was simply perfect i wouldn t have missed it for all the world and now that i think of it in a few days i can let you see for yourself how splendid it was we persuaded her to the songs in the dark and we got a flash light photograph of two of them oh then it was not on the piano she gave them said the idiot oh no all returned the genial gentleman here mr began to look concerned and whispered something to the school

could distinctly perceive the effect of the that she possessed apart from any merely mental experience they were alone this is my story said there was once a large island owned by a great and beneficent proprietor s surface was covered with ample fields forests an beneath its soil was hidden every known countless herds of cattle fed in its broad pastures innumerable fish the waters of its streams fruits grew in abundance in a thousand there was nothing want ng in nature to make it an earthly paradise the slave and the master a traveller weak and helpless with his journey his frail bark in one of the magnificent which dotted the island s shores he was faint with hunger and his form was destitute of even the merest tor as his eyes rested upon the goodly land a smile lit up his wan features here is warmth food rest and comfort he cried as he stepped upon the shore as he left it the craft in which he had made his voyage from him like himself it was of slender the waves soon it

request though it did not convince him that all was as it should be and muttering his indignation he departed but when the master of the house appeared he assumed an expression no more cordial than that which his servant shown this tlie stranger noticed but speaking of he was not therefore he relied upon tha superior quality of mind which a master should possess over a servant and proceeded with his tale sir he said i am a to this island from a place far distant an hour ago i landed upon your shores the frail bark in which i sailed broke in pieces in your harbor and even if it had not done so i could not return whence i came knowing not the way thither nor having the means of on my journey i am to find you here in the midst of plenty my wants are few and i pray you to supply them out of your abundance when i have eaten and drunk and been given suitable clothing of which you will observe i stand in sore need i would like to have you set apart for me a little piece of ground in one of your vast meadows on which by my own labor i can secure my on hearing these words the master of the house turned to his servant in great alarm hasten to call the police he exclaimed this is certainly an insane person who should be apprehended without delay when the servant had gone in search of the officers the traveller said to the master i am at a loss how to account for this reception i am not of mind as my quiet and sensible discourse must convince you i have committed no crime and know not of any offence for which i can be imprisoned by the authorities of this place unless it is my poverty and for that i surely cannot be blamed poverty cried the master of the house know you not that under our code that is the chief of crimes if you confess to being guilty of it the judges will make short work of you at this juncture the island police arrived and they the stranger before the on hearing the slave and the master the statements of h i the judges were about to order sentence when the traveller inquired whether he might not be heard in his own defence to it was answered that he had already admitted himself guilty of the crime alleged  an admission which his personal appearance made st unnecessary  and of the court was too valuable to be wasted in useless hare after consulting among themselves they decided however that if he would engage to be brief they would to

an unusual exhibition the troops were drawn up in a hollow square and the look of on every face showed that something unusual was about to occur a dead silence prevailed for some seconds and then there emerged from a military prison near by a small file of soldiers guarding a man and marching him at a toward the main body the man under guard was dressed in clothing the coat of which was of military cut and color he was evidently in great disgrace for he was hurried along in and about by his escort those behind him carrying their close to his legs it was now evident that the soldiers were drawn up for no other reason than to witness this spectacle the drums began to beat a tune to which the kept time twice was he marched around the square and then the that was with him halted in front of the chief officers of the military bodies present a man in the uniform of a general stepped forward and in a very haughty and severe tone addressed some remarks to the prisoner for such he undoubtedly was my to the parties was not so great that i could hear distinctly what was said but i gathered that the prisoner was a sentence for some of rules and that this public disgrace was part of the penalty that had been pronounced upon him at the end of his the officer deliberately cut the military buttons from the coat worn by the other evidently that he was from wearing those of the service he had then the man was marched back into his jail the band struck up a lively tune and the soldiers were soon out of sight much impressed with the entire affair i could not take my eyes from the disgraced prisoner it struck me that he bore his position with extraordinary fortitude considering the trying circumstances of the case there was nothing of the look in his face nothing in fact but determination and courage by this i do not mean either he marched to the step set for him by the drums as if il were the thing to do knowing that any other course would be met with the treatment out of he listened respectfully to the insulting words ot the officer while a thousand of what were probably his old comrades looked on when all was over he obeyed the order to return to the place of his just as it seemed to me he would have marched to the knife of a had that been the destiny in store for him during the major portion of his march the eyes of the prisoner were fixed on the ground on the way back to the jail however he looked about him like one who knows his present trial is nearly ended and allows his eyes to assume their natural position i was so situated on the outskirts of the crowd that i could now see him plainly the impression i had formed of his being above the ordinary soldier in intellectual was strengthened as he passed near me his gaze met mine i suppose my face reflected the sympathy i felt perhaps the only sentiment of the kind in all that throng either civil or military the prisoner had but a of a second to return my look but in that brief moment he had shot a glance of gratitude that moved me to the utmost when he had passed i turned away with more than a suspicion of moisture in my eyes i wanted to ask the history of this man for it interested me greatly but i could not bring myself to do so i dreaded too much the possibility of hearing that he had done something which would lower him beyond repair in my estimation his pathetic figure and proud face had made an impression on my rather susceptible imagination that i did not wish i decided that it was better to retain this picturesque figure in my memory in and about to have it and by such an as truth for the next three months i wandered over and more and more with the of the climate and the people especially do i love the race whose sons combine the stature of the north american indian with the gentleness of the and the intelligence of the at i never tired of the where the dancing girls of that desert tribe which has furnished entertainment of this sort for centuries sway

but mrs van notwithstanding her own weakness in the matter of ancestors was when it was hinted to her that her son had serious intentions regarding the pretty maiden she would not discuss the subject seriously declaring it preposterous but she was for all that very glad at the prospect of getting out of the country for a long period it was such a pity she often remarked to her husband that their children showed so little regard for their high position and he only laughed at her believing in his simple old heart that king was if anything a little too good for his son a sugar princess as for he had never in do many words to be his wife but he was very fond of her she realized fully the between them for while his father was the richest man in the island where are almost as plenty as hers had barely money enough to support her and her mother when came to say good by her lip trembled but she concealed her feelings he asked if she would answer his letters and s he replied with a toss of her head perhaps if i have time the reason did not press for anything more definite was that he feared a scene might follow he need not have been afraid was too proud to show deep feeling for a man who dared not speak definitely he only answered don t forget now and so they parted two which mrs young had brought with her were kept carefully in the background until it was too late to realize their full significance she had spoken of her children mentioning that they were a boy of fourteen named angel and a girl of eleven called but mrs van had shown no further interest in the matter the young folks were at present in an street boarding house where a sort of was supposed to be attending to them it is more than probable that had sweet young creatures been exhibited in all their glory some means would have been found to the arrangement by which the family was added to the van group perhaps mrs young had some apprehension that this aright be the case certainly neither of the were exhibited until it was too late to retreat a sugar princess during the two or three days before starting found himself the of confidences from several of the with whom he was to be thrown in company as we ll as from mr van mr left him with mrs van one afternoon asking him to consider any of that lady quite as if it had been uttered by him as was only an accepting a salary for duties which had thus far been exceedingly light he could hardly decline to listen to whatever the lady had to say my husband tells me mr i mean i wonder if i shall ever get your former name out of my head that i may have full confidence in you and speak with perfect freedom i will therefore say that i have two principal objects in taking my children abroad at this time one is to remove william from the society of a girl who has formed i learn an attachment for him that is ludicrous when the difference in their stations is considered and who is to make it still worse with the blood of the native inhabitants of these islands the other is to introduce my daughter to more refined circles than can be found here where the people are as a rule very common she has i believe a brilliant future before her if she is brought in contact with the the right sort of people quite stunned to be made the of such intimate secrets could not find words to reply but why he managed to say at last why simply this you are going to be to a large extent in charge of our party while we are abroad i wish you to have an eye on nay son as reasons may a sugar princess themselves to you from time to time an influence over him if i may call it that should you find him inclined to lower himself in any way and knowing as you now do my other purpose in making this journey you may also be able to help me from time to time in that matter the young man kept a dead silence you are under an arrangement with mr pursued the lady and i have no wish to interfere with it in the least i only want you to understand that i am not apt to forget a service and that you will be handsomely for anything you may do on the lines i have laid down good day as walked down the steps of the mansion he felt his cheek burning with something akin to shame mrs van evidently considered him entirely in the light of a servant to whom s he could confide any of her and who would have no other consideration hi his than the amount of cash he was to receive for the service for the first time his new position him had there been any way to escape his arrangement with mr he would have done so that very night he felt that if he were to tell his employer that he could not undertake any affairs for mrs van it would simply mean a termination of his engagement in what sort of position would that leave him he owed mr borrowed money he had not

dirt to make us stay on board on the fourth of july but i don t see how we are going to help ourselves added looking at for a solution of this difficult problem i do how keep still don t say a word here continued scatter now and i will be on the in a few minutes strolled about the deck a short time and went to the place of meeting where he was soon joined by the rest of the discontented pupils how many fellows can we muster asked lie when his associates in mischief had again gathered around him i know at least a dozen who are up to anything replied but some of them are in the other watch what are you going to do i ll tell you there are the professors and the third at the swinging boom we will drop into them when the go down to supper and make for the shore all the rest of the boats are at the and before they can get them into the water we shall be out of their reach what do you think of that for a plan i think it is a first rate one but hadn t we better wait till the turn in suggested no the boats will all be hoisted up to the at sunset we must do it while the professors are at supper or not at all we want eight oars for tht america afloat b r e and six for the third that makes fourteen fellows can we raise as many as that yes i we can we will try at any rate but you must look out or some fellow will blow the whole thing added mind whom you speak to the of the various students was and it was decided what ones should be invited to join the enterprise the discontented boys separated and went to work with great caution to obtain the needed unfortunately in such a crowd of young men there are always enough to engage in any mischievous plot and it is quite likely that twice as many as were wanted could have been obtained to man the boats in the expedition missed very much in arranging the details of the present enterprise while at the academy they had mischief so often that each seemed to be necessary to the other but had he was now third lieutenant of the ship and it was not safe to suggest a conspiracy to him for he would attempt to gain favor with the principal by exposing or it yet was so bold in thought and so daring in execution that could hardly abandon the hope of obtaining his assistance besides the third lieutenant would be officer of the deck when the professors went to supper and might wink at their departure in the boats if he did not actually help them off would you say anything to asked outward bound or still in doubt of as they happened to meet again in the waist to exclaimed in an energetic whisper i mean so certainly not i should as soon think of speaking to himself but may join us he is always in for a good time why you he is third lieutenant of the ship no matter if he is i think would like to join us nonsense i he has been in office only three days and it would break him he would be degraded to the replied who could not help thinking that was beside himself in proposing such a thing and that the enterprise was doomed to failure in such hands if he won t join us perhaps he will help us off he is officer of the deck you know in the second dog watch i know he is but don t you open your mouth to him if you do i ll back out at once back out yes back out i believe you are crazy why don t you go to captain and done with it said with energy i haven t any hold on and i have on f what do you mean asked the prudent curiously young afloat if won t join us he won t blow on us you may depend upon that he wouldn t dare to do it i could break him before if i chose said with conscious power that the case of course i shouldn t think of saying anything to him if i did not know what i was talking about i have him where the hair is short and he knows it aft well as i do what is it no matter what it is when a thing is told me in confidence i keep it to myself but if he turns traitor to his he must look out for he knows what it is well if you can get him he will be a first rate fellow to have i think i can get him here he comes you keep out of the way and i will see how deep the water is went forward to find a student to whom he had been to speak in the interest of the enterprise leaving to with the old lion of whose teeth however seemed to have been worn out in the cause up demanded the third lieutenant who was now off duty and therefore allowed to speak to the crew though it was a privilege of which the officers seldom availed themselves who said anything was up asked you look as though you meant something what were you and ike talking about just now continued about me i ll be bound for you looking at me as though you t outward bound or what makes you think so have you heard anything asked fearful that the plot had out not a word i only judged by your looks i suppose if anything was up you wouldn t have anything	isabella-lucy-bird

me so permit me to recall your remark that you intended to marry a title i think you are within reasonable distance of your ambition now if i guess lord can do his own without you in said i have no wish to do so i assure you how you do get on cousin how you do me cousin they looked at each other and smiled had they only been left alone at that moment it is probable they would have come to an understanding but fate desirous of the sent to interrupt them he had been them for some time and found comfort in the thought that they were quarrelling as usual but when he saw smiling on her cousin he could bear it no longer and so came forward as a laughed at the sulky expression of his i guess you ve lost a dollar and picked up a cent said she you do look cross miss oh i am quite amiable i assure you replied with elaborate courtesy said i can see without glasses some looked at the pair with a eye so far as he could see had quite made up her mind to be lady the idea of losing her made him notwithstanding her accent her her freedom her want of repose and of many feminine traits which he valued highly he was deeply in love with her there was something about which he could not understand at times she forgot to play her part in the comedy and on such occasions had been charmed and fascinated beyond all expression a chance word a sudden glance a womanly action  all these betrayed a deeper nature hidden under the of her exterior but such words were rare and just when he began to wax sympathetic she would flash back into the society beauty all sparkle and surface then he was puzzled and she is like a diamond he thought strolling away and leaving her with as brilliant and as hard mr come and sit by me i wish to speak with you he turned and saw mrs tapping a chair with the of her knowing she was a sympathetic soul to whom he could freely confide his troubles he accepted her invitation readily i hope you are amused with this entertainment said he in a conventional manner i am more amused with that entertainment answered mrs glancing towards and her attendant are you i am not you would be more than human if you were mr miss what do you mean am i blind am i a fool said mrs impatiently or are you an burying your head in the sand under the delusion that no one can see you i understand replied after a pause but i did not know that my passion was so patent to all the world am i all the world you are a representative why don t you marry asked mrs abruptly pulled his moustache and she won t have me put her to the test i have no chance against replied savagely i haven t a title besides much as i admire my cousin she  she oh i know all about that said mrs cutting him short she falls short of your standard of feminine excellence i remember the picture you painted of her last year and how you expressed of the american girl well she is as you see  but charming yet if you are in love with her don t let carry her off marry her yourself but let me tell you a mr a certain man picked up a glittering stone said he it and but it s only a piece of glass after all and not worth keeping then he threw it away and it was picked up by his neighbour the did not throw it away but examined it carefully then said he lo it is not glass but a diamond worth a king s well well replied mrs with supreme disdain cannot you read my riddle are you going to throw away the diamond because you believe it but worthless miss glass take my advice mr she added earnestly be the second man of my when returned home that evening he thought long and deeply over mrs s it seemed to hint at some mystery connected with of which she was he felt inclined to propose to and take the chances of her being the costly diamond or the worthless piece of glass but he dreaded lest she should prove to be the latter rather than the former his mother called him into her before she retired that evening she was radiant lord asked me if he could speak to to morrow afternoon she said smiling at her son does he intend to proposed asked with an odd feeling in his breast of course he does it will be a brilliant match for will she accept him mother my dear she would

numbers as to warrant the holding of an of cured and numbers of who cannot bear the rough life of the mountains fill its hotels and and others who have been partially restored by a summer of out go into the city in the winter to complete the cure it stands at a height of feet on an enormous plain and has a most glorious view of the i should hate even to spend a week there the sight of those

indians added to the appearance of the streets the day i was there they belonged to the tribe through which i had to pass and governor hunt introduced me to a fine looking young chief very well dressed in hide and his courtesy for me if i needed it the indian stores and fur stores and fur interested me most the crowds in the streets perhaps owing to the snow on the ground were almost solely masculine i only saw five women the whole day there were men in every hunters and in clothing men of the plains with and in great blue relics of the war in suits in ix the rocky mountains coats and caps and hide boots with the hair outside and blankets behind their huge in light kid gloves rich english sporting clean comely and looking and hundreds of indians on their small the men wearing suits with beads and red blankets with faces painted and hair hanging and straight and much up riding with over their town tired and confused me and in spite of mrs s kind hospitality i was glad when a man brought at nine yesterday morning he said she was a little demon she had done nothing but buck and had him off on the bridge i found that he had put a on her and whenever she anything she it by i rode till i was well through the town long enough to produce a severe pain in my which was not relieved for some time even after i had changed my position it was a lovely indian summer day so warm that the snow on the ground looked an i rode over the plains for some time then gradually reached the rolling country along the base of the mountains and a stream with cotton woods along it and houses about every half mile i passed and met frequently and picked up a containing a purse with five hundred dollars in it which t afterwards had the great pleasure of a lady s life in litter ix restoring to the

larger there are neither hotels nor and that it is the custom for the to receive travellers charging them at the usual hotel rate for accommodation it is a very satisfactory arrangement however at my first halting place the host was unwilling to receive people in this way i afterwards found or i certainly should not have presented my at the door of a large frame house with large and a generally

been with us faltered smiled it will not answer to say that to me he said u i tell you i am not going by guess work i love you with all my soul but i would rather see your corpse brought to my gate than to have you marry the daughter of after what i know s teeth ah he cried you are a cruel man your hatred has led you to this a hatred that you had no right to form in the first place and that has grown until even the happiness of your only son must be sacrificed to it no was the reply your happiness lies with a girl against whom no man can bring a word of accusation come home and think about it when you are calm you will admit that i am right and that this passion that has brought you to so a pass is only temporary tie continued his voice growing i love you if i have seemed rough it was because of my anger at your continued opposition to what is surely for mb your best good come home with me and let ms talk it over the two men vanished through the woods walking slowly and talking as they went and a third man came out of the thick of trees just above them looking as if he had received a blow it was who had started out for an early walk with no definite object in view and had come suddenly within hearing of the angry voices he had heard s threat to drown his son and had been ready at first to interfere if necessary to prevent that catastrophe then as he caught further bits of the heated conversation which showed him that had been visiting at the summer house under circumstances more or less open to suspicion he felt almost willing to offer his aid to the in case he was unable to carry out his purpose his father has taken him away and judging by the terror of his face he will mould him to his will mused as he walked back to the hotel he is a cur and a coward but and his face grew darker if talk comes of this god help him bald in a ram chapter in a fever was in such a highly nervous when he reached home that he was obliged to refuse breakfast and retired at once to his chamber in the hope that sleep would give him temporary relief his father had said such things in the way of argument that he hardly knew how to answer them even to his own mind he felt a certain guilt and he was obliged to admit that a good deal of his conduct was not whatever his parent s mistakes whatever his errors of judgment he had surely been a thoughtful father to him never had he tried to him in anything until this case arose after going into his room he threw himself on the bed where through his awakened mind ran the long list of kindly things that his father had done the education which he had provided when the stood at his elbow and he had to deny himself every luxury that his son might have it all the way in which his trouble had been hid lest it should annoy him to as well as a hundred other instances of similar and in payment for this he had that morning addressed his father like a young from the of south street wondered that the roof over his head did not fall and crush him for an ungrateful still this father of his had driven him frantic for s the the moment by what he said of words so totally for that patience fell before them reflected that the suddenness of the assault upon his feelings his action for it gave him no time to think poor it d break her heart if she dreamed of it he thought of awhile and of the sweet tokens of her love which she had given him he tried to repent of his wrong but it was only on account of being detected that he was truly sorry it is the getting found out that a of the latest and most the thoughts of kept returning to his father did he not owe him something in return for his years of kindness was there no way to reconcile his duty to others with that which it was the right of this friend to demand it must be hard to bring a child to the age of manhood and find him refusing to listen to advice meant for his best good there was too a gentle feeling crept over him as her vision came across his mind beautiful as a lily loving him with a tenderness none the less evident because partly hidden by a naturally reserved it was no wonder that she had made an impression on the iron mind of his father thought of the handsome way in which the colonel and mrs had always treated him of the sweet hours he had passed with he had given her cause to think that she was the one destined to be his for life and now he proposed to desert her contemptible as it was it had a double meanness after he had allowed her father to save his in his distress under an implied expectation ought he not to sacrifice everything in a keep this obligation could he justify himself even for love s sake in deserving the contempt of honest men after what had happened then there came into his mind ike the beginning of a great fog that is to everything in sight the awful thought that his father had placed there respecting the obligation of a woman who to be in all things above reproach he had it when it was uttered and	arthur-conan-doyle
wondering in his way whether all hope must really be abandoned it was evident that the who were round the victims were to remain behind with them while the others who were mounted would guard the three women and himself he could not understand why the throats of his companions had not been already cut unless it were that with an eastern refinement of cruelty this would wait until the were close to them so that the warm bodies of their victims might be an insult to the no doubt that was the right explanation the colonel had heard of such a trick before but in that case there would not be more than twelve with the prisoners were there any of the friendly ones among them if and six of his men were there and if could get his arms free and his hand upon his revolver they might come through yet the colonel a desert drama his neck and groaned in his disappointment he could see the of the guards in the they were all men who were beyond either pity or and the others must have gone on with the advance for the first time the stiff old soldier abandoned hope good bye you fellows god bless you he cried as a negro pulled at his s nose ring and made him follow the others the women came after him in a misery too deep for words their departure was a relief to the three men who were left i am glad they are gone said from his heart yes yes it is better cried how long are we to wait not very long now said grimly as the closed in around them the colonel and the three women gave one backward glance when they came to the edge of the between the straight stems of the palms they saw the gleam of the fire and above the group of they a desert drama caught a last glimpse of the three white hats an instant later the began to trot and when they looked back once more the palm grove was only a black with the vague twinkle of a light somewhere in the heart of it as with yearning eyes they gazed at that throbbing red point in the darkness they passed over the edge of the depression and in an instant the huge silent desert was round them without a sign of the which they had left on every side the velvet blue black sky with its blazing stars downwards to the vast coloured plain the two were into one at their point of the women had sat in the silence of despair and the colonel had been silent also  for what could he say  but suddenly all four started in their and gave a sharp cry of dismay in the hush of the night there had come from behind them the crack of a rifle then another then several together with a brisk rat and then after an interval one more a desert drama it may be the it may be the cried mrs with a sudden of hope colonel don t you think it may be the yes yes it must be the the colonel had listened but all was silent again then he took his hat off with a solemn gesture there is no use deceiving ourselves mrs said he we may as well face the truth our friends are gone from us but they have met their end like brave men but why should they fire their guns they had they had she shuddered as she said it that is true said the colonel i would not for the world take away any real grounds of hope which you may have but on the other hand there is no use in preparing bitter disappointments for ourselves if we had been listening to an attack we should have heard some reply besides an egyptian attack would have been an attack in force no doubt it is as you say a little a desert drama strange that they should have wasted their  by jove look at that he was pointing over the eastern desert two figures were moving across its expanse swiftly and stealthily dark shadows against the lighter ground they saw them dimly dipping and rising over the rolling desert now lost now in the uncertain light they were flying away from the and then suddenly they halted upon the summit of a sand hill and the prisoners could see them plainly against the sky they were men but they sat their as a sits his horse corps cried the colonel two men said miss in a voice of despair only a ma am throwing out all over the desert this is one of them main body ten miles off as likely as not there they go giving the alarm good old corps the self contained soldier had suddenly turned almost inarticulate with his u a desert drama excitement there was a red flash upon the top of the sand hill and then another followed by the crack of the then with a the two figures were gone as swiftly and silently as two in a stream the had halted for an instant as if uncertain whether they should delay their journey to pursue them or not there was nothing left to pursue now for amid the of the sand drift the might have gone in any direction the galloped back along the line with and orders then the began to trot and the hopes of the prisoners were by the agonies of the terrible mile after mile and mile after mile they sped over that vast expanse the women clinging as best they might to the the colonel almost as spent as they but still keenly on the for any sign of the i think i

argument one straw whether it is or labor the honest has invested in the essential if i live by the sale of my labour and if i spend five hundred hours labour on a production the sale of which is to that labour and pay the debt i have incurred to my butcher baker etc by thus applying my labour the who a similar article from france and makes it english with fifty hours labour can sell it at a profit nine times cheaper than i can sell it without going to and so he elbows the honest out of the dramatic market and drives him elsewhere men of genius will not in any number so apply their labour as to go to prison for it and that would be the probable fate of and should they come back to earth and endeavour to live by writing original plays in england under the and the a single such might live but not half a dozen and take notice englishmen can all see this where any nation but england is the we warned she would her literature if she played the same game in all literature we are playing in dramatic literature she persisted and did her literature what is the difference between her and england none in our favour the only vital difference is this first she did not and with but did her like a man and we do it like a secondly she has lately read a noble and we have not has formally and feeling that she has suppressed invention as we continue to do english invention she is now giving the artificial encouragement has just offered for native productions in or french upon a scale i learn from the times april that the higher are to be for the in french on account of the severe competition the must face in that language daylight breaking in thus you see common sense and uncommon honesty have dawned on and why not on ours when i was at in there were eight hundred painters in the town and not twenty writers of these painters two or three hundred would have made better writ the eighth ers than painters eight hundred to twenty  that proportion was never in nature the of was a deal of paper and a sight of canvas there will not waste their brains with thieves invention is too hard and laborious too and easy then some people ask me do you really think giving the french property in his works would make so great a difference i don t think it know it it would make a wonderful difference it would destroy fences prices at present a selling to a manager is literally a thief selling to a fence or of stolen goods the last i i talked with a thief who had stolen five thousand pounds worth of i asked him what the fence had given him for them thirty pounds sir said he  the average price of a new play in many flourishing london theatres is now four pounds this was given in evidence in the case of shepherd v and i will find twenty witnesses to to the truth of it on oath before either house of parliament this it seems was employed by messrs shepherd and to go to paris and appropriate pieces from the french authors he improved on his instructions he not only appropriated from his but from his kept a ms and went and one of these pieces to mr conquest of the so much for laws which sap the great foundations of morality and hope that only a part of the house will tumble down this same writer by no means devoid of talent sold two pieces out and out to a provincial manager of my acquaintance for one pound a piece on and me for five hunted pounds i wrote and asked the provincial whether that sum was the price of the muse i received from most of them marks of sympathy highly honourable to them for which i now publicly thank ti em and beg them to command me in return they furnished me with a mass of documents which i should like to lay before parliament they would answer a nobler purpose than that i got them for they prove that does nobody any good drives away the and the the eighth here they lie on my desk committed on smaller than on they feed and to what end three separate lists of plays from sixty to one hundred in number offered to a manager for thirty shillings and one pound per here is five hundred pound himself selling ve new pieces out and out with the for three pounds to one manager and offering himself and a female relation as actors together with all his pieces for three pounds per week to another see the evidence t he sold his version of my piece ms and all to the victoria for two pounds i had to pay three pounds fifteen shillings to a for a copy of it thus does the fine arts above the mechanical arts and now mark here is one of the selling what i happen to know to have been an original english composition for two pounds another poor devil sends a ms also original for thirty shillings and if not approved offers to write another and another and another sooner than a rival shall win the thirty shillings but for and the system of fences prices it has introduced he would have had fifteen pounds for it they are starving themselves as well as the and disgusting the better class of spectators n b when a turns honest for a moment and falls on him he gets only the price of stolen goods for his invention compare all this and much more to the same tune which i once more offer to lay upon oath

are rich in the southern vegetation they are adorned with arches models of towers and castles a roman statues and chinese temples and fountains it has an immense artificial under a hill in which we embarked in fantastic boats and after sailing through several extensive chambers with above and around us we emerged into a picturesque lake from the waters of which rises a beautiful marble temple with groups of around it the boat is rowed through a little river whose banks are bordered with flowers under a couple of chinese bridges we were landed near a classic temple and conducted by winding paths over foot bridges through to a small summer house several of us were invited to enter which we did our attention was directed to pause stranger here first saw light in the circle of his fathers the house was alas i too for the man there was one world there are two said he and sunny shores or something in the ceiling and when we looked up several tiny streams of water were turned upon us we were sold hut as water is our element we did not complain though we with a german whose stove pipe hat was and the in his white deprived of its integrity in crossing one of the chinese bridges a dozen fine streams upon our blue cloth we were into a curious iron swing only to be upon when we could not stop the german retired in disgust these water works are said to have been constructed to please the children but it is rather a bad bringing up for them we did not wear shirts so the did us no harm some of us returned to in stages in order to see more of the country along the shore the railroad to nice is in process of construction the trains must be half the time in the the road extends along the shore and is one of the most beautiful drives in europe with the on one side and the country with a vast variety of scenery on the other the reading of the journals was completed but every afternoon a portion of the students were permitted to go on shore and they found something new and interesting at every visit at last the health of was reported to be good and the signal for sailing appeared at the head of the american prince boat alongside sir reported a seaman to the officer of the deck on board the young america in italy and in five minutes more attended by her uncle and the count di were on deck the party were warmly welcomed by the officers we have come from to express our great obligations to you captain for the service you have rendered to we shall never forget mr o s efforts in her behalf i am sure that all we did afforded us aa much pleasure as it did you replied the captain of the i think mr o like to do more work of the kind however he may speak for himself gave both hands to the irish italian and poured forth her thanks in her own musical language the sailing of the was deferred and the attended by the captain and o went on board of the prince where expressed his obligations to the principal he stated that had not only been removed from his position as guardian of the young but had been convicted witli of conspiracy and fraud and sent to pi was now s guardian and she was to reside with him in but she was not to become the di for several years mr we all regret the loss of your fine ship continued and after your good service to us you must permit us to you in whole or in part for the loss you have sustained not at all sir i have sustained no loss replied the a patriotic american of great wealth insisted upon presenting this steamer to me to be used for the benefit of american c shores or we should be glad to pay for her impossible sir mr hei late owner would not take a dollar for her and you cannot pay him in money he and his amiable lady will spend the winter in italy and probably you may serve them by making their stay pleasant they are in now and i will give you a letter of introduction i shall invite them to to spend the winter with me we have a delightful climate one thing more mr will you allow me to present ten thousand to the young officer mr o who rescued my fair ward from the toils of the i cannot permit it replied the principal promptly tbe young gentlemen must learn to help the unfortunate and relieve the even when they have personal attractions than we are sailors and our first duty is to save those who are in peril i don t any money protested o but his expenses were considerable suggested mr permitted the guardian to return to o only the sum he had actually expended in the service of after a lunch in the cabin of the prince the party went on shore to watch the departure of the which was soon under way and standing out between the two upon me o if anything should happen to the count there would be a young man ready to step into his shoes said scott as he paced the deck of the young america in italy and for you laughed the hero of the romance she s a with plenty of money and as as a new blown rose but i hope nothing at all at all happen to the count for he is a

his companion in these days he said with a wealth of meaning it is something to have a wife to whom such a thing would be morally impossible there was a great deal in this admitted to himself a very great deal it was the only thing that had been said which had a distinctly favorable effect upon him he knew the the that pervaded his circle in relation to married women everybody knew all about some of them except the husbands they were and there were not a few cases where this giddy young man had seen fashionable with and stately and organ music with a column in the society prints and a grand tour of europe to them where the bride had only left the arms of a lover perhaps several of them to go to those of her bridegroom the husbands didn t know they had never suspected up to this day but some time there was liable to an explosion possibly the snap of a revolver yes if a man must marry it was a great thing to i am a have a wife of whom such things either before or after the ceremony were impossible to conceive the had a good deal of in his composition and he saw the effect of this suggestion but he wisely decided to say nothing more at the time hoping that the seed he had sown would gain some root of itself and fearful to disturb it by any more present cultivation he suggested a walk over the premises and as this was one of the objects of mr s visit he did not hesitate to follow his leader everything was certainly in the very of luxury and taste this entire is to be miss s said mr as they reached the second floor m you see it is on the side and commands a view of the

itself upon the girl who was to use that magnificent apartment so pure and sweet that its offices must be largely superfluous so modest he was sure no maid would be permitted to remain within those doors while her mistress herself of her final garments to be the husband of such a creature would be a glory for one as pure as free from the of earth as she but never for a man of thought of low from ten and to was too far a cry he could not estimate the distance had always considered himself miss a pretty lucky fellow but he went out of that house thoroughly if he could have been reared in a different school why had he been allowed to follow every inclination since he was in skirts it would have been so much better to have kept a heart in which there was one white spot than to have neck deep in all that sea of passion he thought as he rode with mr toward the where they were to lunch of a possible young man entirely new to the knowledge of sex in its and distorted shapes wedded to a girl like living with her an life in such a palace as that the reflection was so that had it not been for his promise to dine with the he would have gone directly home from his lunch and drunk h into forthwith the did not again allude to the matter that most deeply upon his mind he saw that his friend was in a new mood and he hoped that good would come of it the match he was try ing to further seemed to him a most desirable one in itself to say nothing of his wish to please his employer family and wealth would make the proper combination he thought that as he grew older would acquire wisdom ultimately fitting into the convenient arranged for him and grateful to those who had assisted in placing him there while getting ready for dinner letters were brought to mr one of them being the one

proceeded a little afraid of her a purity so much higher than he could ever claim and when she withdrew according to custom to allow the gentlemen to light their cigars he discussed politics theatrical matters and a dozen other things with the hon he was well aware that mr was no saint before mr david alluded to the fact he knew him for a successful and that in the matter of women he was

of steep rock steps crowning the peak which every village are almost invariably the piled up temples towers and buildings of a with their colour and gloom the flutter of their prayer flags and the sound of the incessant wild music of horns drums and an air of mystery the whole for with all this cheerful flutter of flags and the sound of music and the signs of industry it was very rarely that any inhabitants were to be seen just the of a woman s red now and then or the red frock of a in relief against the grey rock these tribes are not though they are down on most maps as tribes but in the extraordinary of their and villages they reminded me vividly of the and the fantastic of and in the valley it is a temptation to linger on that day s journey i did actually linger on it for one of my as i expected was quite unequal to his work and i had to walk a good deal and allow of many for rest the halting places were magnificent but food was scarce and dear as every of rice must be brought up from the low country although we ascended on that day feet the climate became and from what i observed later it appears quite possible that in temperature each degree west is equal to a degree south grain crops and trees were in their first vivid green the silver was in its beauty the golden was well advanced the was in bloom and in places where the opened a little there were narrow of the finest turf on which the camp in the season on which red roses with coarse were already in blossom there was no traffic and even an unless c sin to li fan ting he were a red telling his beads or his prayer was a in the late afternoon at an abrupt and superb turn of the river we crossed a bridge high above the torrent on the other side of which is a fine village of extraordinary man houses clinging to of a peak crowned by a small temple and a very large and fantastic a tower ninety feet high very ancient and in good repair gives dignity to the of ta fan the road the village by a steep winding of steps cut in the rock and passes through a into cool shadow created by high massive stone houses on either side so massive are they and so high are the windows above the ground that they suggest memories of villages in the i rested in a large house in which as in the others a chinese was living with his family these had grand ideas of i entered into a guest hall with brown wood with two rooms on each side and a large room behind a gallery of brown wood with rooms opening from it runs round the hall at a height of about eight feet from the floor it was very cool and clean and i sat in a chinese easy chair glad to be out of the my host who was the was a very courteous chinese and offered me cakes honey and tea he said that all the houses in the were built by though chinese live in the lower villages that if a chinese a new house he it after the same fashion for that nothing but building  specially the inward slope of the very thick walls  can stand the tremendous winds the village less by for which there is not sufficient than by the traffic in the trading season the asked me why i was travelling to be murdered by the and evidently attached no value to my statement that it was to see the country i wished then and elsewhere that i had been able to say that it was in order a book for that would have given me rank and would have been an intelligible explanation after leaving this village the mountains closed in again upon the pass their forms growing in wild majesty there were glimpses a grey mountain town of snow peaks with pines on their skirts and where the shadow was and deepest and the peaks are and on a small patch of partially level ground separated from a very high and bare mountain with which captain at feet in height by the roaring river stands the wild mountain town of li fan ting the residence of a small magistrate though only possessing a population of five hundred before we actually reached it waves of sunset gold rolled down the pass distant snow blushed red every peak took on purple or  there was a of colour the wind fell to a dead calm there was a touch of frost in the dry air when suddenly the whole glory of mountain and chasm died out and the colour vanished leaving only the distant snow peaks burning red against a sky of tender green this small grey city on whose nature places her looks the final of chinese  the end of all things a well built narrow wall runs between li fan ting and the river it in and then in a most fantastic way the of two mountain spurs which wall in a behind the town bare and rocky as all else is looking like great flights of steep stairs following the steep and irregular of the ground a clear blue torrent tumbling down at the back through the town and is for many water mills mostly with wheels as on the plain these mills are round and look like small towers and only a man below the average height can stand upright in them and trees contrast pleasantly with the bare and soften

to a height of about feet and from their and solitary depths we had glimpses of golden atmosphere and rose lit not of the land very far off but of the land nearer now in all its grandeur gaining in by too through a broken vista of purple of the plains lying in the late sunlight their baked brown expanse into the likeness of a sunset sea rolling infinitely in waves of misty gold a lady s life in letter we rode upwards through the gloom on a steep trail blazed through the forest all my intellect concentrated on avoiding being dragged off my horse by impending branches or having the blankets badly torn as those of my companions were by sharp dead limbs between which there was hardly room to pass the horses breathless and requiring to stop every few yards though their except myself were the gloom of the dense ancient silent forest is to me awe inspiring on such an evening it is except for the branches creaking in the soft wind the frequent snap of decayed timber and a murmur in the pine tops as of a not distant all tending to produce and a sadness hardly akin to pain there no s axe has ever rung the trees die when they have attained their prime and stand there dead and bare till the mountain winds lay them prostrate the pines grew smaller and more as we ascended and the last wore a tortured look the timber line was passed but yet a little higher a slope  of mountain meadow dipped to the south west towards a bright stream under ice and and a grove of the beautiful silver marked our ground the trees were in miniature but so exquisitely arranged that one might well ask what artist s hand had planted them scattering them here them there and training their slim l grand er ar long s the rocky mountains towards heaven hereafter when i call up memories of the glorious

this letter is by a courageous artist who attempted the ascent just before i arrived but after out at the timber line for a week was by the perpetual storms and was driven down again leaving some very valuable apparatus about feet from the summit and the horses securely making the beds of pine shoots and di up logs for fuel warmed us all jim built up a great fire and before long we were all sitting round it at it didn t matter much that we had to drink our tea out of the battered meat in which it waa a lady s life in letter and eat of beef with pine smoke without plates or forks treat jim as a gentleman and find him one i had been told and though his manner was certainly bolder and than that of gentlemen generally no imaginary fault could be found he was very agreeable as a man of culture as well as a child of nature the was altogether out of sight he was very courteous and even kind to me which was fortunate as the young men had little idea of showing even ordinary that night i made the acquaintance of his dog said to be the best hunting dog in with the body and legs of a but a head approaching that of a a noble face with a wistful human expression and the most truthful eyes i ever saw in an animal his master loves him if he loves anything but in his savage moods ill treats him s devotion never and his truthful eyes are rarely taken off his master s face he is almost human in his intelligence and unless he is told to do he never takes notice of any one but jim in a tone as if speaking to a human being his master pointing to me said go to that lady and don t leave her

small tent and lunch basket to await me half way before seven i started myself with in front of me leaving the servants to follow with the on reaching the shelter tent i halted for two hours or till the had got a good start after passing me at the end of the march i usually found the tent pitched on ground near a hamlet the of which provided milk fuel and other necessaries at fixed prices afternoon tea was speedily prepared and dinner consisting of roast meat and boiled rice was ready two hours later after dinner i usually conversed with the on local interests and was in bed soon after eight the servants and fed and talked till nine when the sound of their the start indicated that they were going to sleep like most with their heads closely covered with their before starting each morning the account was made out and i paid the personally the of the soldier when they were not a cause of annoyance were a constant amusement though his ceaseless changes of finery and the daily growth of his baggage awakened grave suspicions the marched four miles an hour in front of me with a swinging military stride a large in a heavily ornamented over his shoulder and black or white wound round from ankle to knee with broad bands of orange or scarlet white a white shirt with a short white muslin frock with hanging sleeves and a leather over it a red cap with a dark blue wound round it with one end hanging over his back a and a profusion of rings were his ordinary costume and in his he wore a and a revolver and suspended from it a long tobacco made of the skin of some animal a large leather purse and as the days went on he into blue and white muslin wit c among the a scarlet wore a gold embroidered peak and a huge white muslin with much change of ornaments and appeared frequently with a great bunch of or a cluster of crimson roses all his was colossal it and the head together must have been fully a third of his total height he was a most fantastic object and very observant and skilful in his attentions to me but if i had known what i afterwards knew i should have hesitated about taking these long lonely with him for my sole attendant between and this violent hatred and jealousy existed i have mentioned roads and my road as the great route from western india into central asia this is a fitting time for an explanation the traveller who to reach the of from cannot be borne along in a carriage or hill cart for much of the way he is limited to a foot pace and if he has regard to his horse he walks down all rugged and steep which are many and at most bridges by roads must be understood bridle paths worn by traffic alone across the valleys but elsewhere constructed with great toil and expense as nature the road maker to follow her the start lead and carry his track along the narrow valleys and which she has marked out for him for miles at a time this road has been out of from feet to feet in depth and is merely a ledge above a raging torrent the worst parts

of the scholar while he is an expecting an obedience he does not believe in his own he kind and considerate and regards his pupil as an man endowed with certain rights which none may upon with he is both just and merciful his heart being filled with love to god and love to man such was not mr the greatest sin of a student was to have a of his own he had not the power or the to that will with the of duty and he broke it down not by coarse abuse but by making the pupil so uncomfortable that a total submission was better than i and and a in mild tempered boys like paul the task was an easy one when no principle was at stake tlie professor walked up and down the deck brooding over he could not to abandon his situation on the one hand it seemed impossible to acknowledge that he was wholly wrong on the other when he had thoroughly cooled off he was willing to own that it wag necessary for the captain to go on deck and that if he had comprehended tlie situation he should have given him permission to do so but he knew nothing about the management of a vessel how should a professor of greek and latin be expected to understand a matter which even the most ignorant could comprehend and of which even a boy of sixteen had made himself master boys could play base ball but he did not know how and it seemed just as much beneath hia dignity to be familiar with practical he was sorry now that he had not given captain permission to go on deck for it was impossible to the arguments of the principal but at the same time he had not the duties of his office he had been informed that all the students even to the captain were subject to his will and pleasure during school hours and therefore he had a perfect right to detain the captain it was not his fault that a blunder had been made he had not made it the order which mr had shown him would remedy the difficulty in future and prevent its repetition but if that order was it would assure the pupils that captain had c le and or been fully sustained and that the professor had not been sustained mr shuddered at the thought for a student at the expense of the was an which he could not countenance the captain s will would remain unbroken and the professor would occupy a secondary position on board of the the learned gentleman wall ed the deck hour after hour to devise a plan by which he could return to his position without the sacrifice of any portion of his dignity mr in saying that the professor s resignation would be a serious inconvenience to him had left the door open for him to his final action the was eventually to visit greece and other classic lands and be was very anxious to continue his travels not only without expense to himself but while in the receipt of a handsome salary such an opportunity to see europe could never again he presented to him and be was not willing to sacrifice it professor was becoming more reasonable but there was the will of captain an fortress in his path perhaps mr now that the excitement of the first interview had subsided might help him out of the embarrassing though his decided manner was not very encouraging the professor determined to have another interview and as soon as he saw the principal alone he opened the subject again what you said about my resignation mr gives me some uneasiness it is not my wish to subject you to any inconvenience by leaving you in young america in holland and a foreign land  where much delay must necessarily before you can obtain a suitable person to fill my place said he in a tone of embarrassment it would my plans very much but i cannot the vessel and tlie lives of those on board of her the position of captain is yon will perceive i am quite willing now to say that if i had understood the situation i should have permitted mr to leave the class and i am quite willing to say that your services as an are entirely satisfactory to me added the principal a they were e to him than they were to the students of the then we seem to be in full accord with each other on these points replied the professor i trust some may be made to reconcile the of opinion on the question of discipline you do not sustain me mr i cannot sir if i did i should expect the to go to the bottom with all on board in the first gale of wind she should captain happen to be his greek at the i think i understand the matter better now and in a similar emergency i should permit him to leave the class in matters of and i have more confidence in the judgment of captain than in yours he must be absolute in his position as captain of the vessel e le and oe of course sir and in the composition of a soup doubtless you would have more confidence in the judgment of your cook than in mine added the professor for the cook and the captain appeared to be on the same to him and as a professor of greek he did not regard it as any more to his dignity not to know anything of the principles of than to be ignorant of the art of making a soup the order which i have written and which i shall to captain as soon as the comes to anchor will set the matter right said mr u insist on issuing that order	isabella-lucy-bird

from that sort of thing but mrs ward seems to enjoy it she certainly did forward so as to get a full view of the stage mrs ward s eyes were alight she would have enjoyed being in the throng herself and would have danced as madly as the worst of them and enough miss bull appeared also her face was flushed her eyes glittered and her breath came and went in quick it s wonderful she said leaning out of the box and fixing her eyes intently on the whirling mass it s very pretty said her dull brain could not understand the wild madness of the scene and she was as unmoved as though she had been listening to a sermon whispered mrs ward come back to your seat the head of it is the great dance no answered and clung to s arm i will stop here it is too terrible the old man understood and in the darkness of the box he slipped his arm round her in that kind embrace felt safe if she looked upon that madness again she felt that she must cry out quite appreciated her feelings it was the experienced by the spiritual against the material a woman scorned the action of the proceeded rapidly pen climbed a tree the surrounded it and dragged him down emerged from a frantic crowd bearing his

flashed out into a wild the scene became lightning flashed thunder rolled the shrieked in the the dancers spun whirled plunged and sprang and bounded and rushed about the stage everywhere at unexpected moments appeared tossing and caressing the head of whirling out and in as the rainbow lights played upon her restless figure finally when the was at its height came a flash of lightning a crash of thunder the riot died away the sprang from the stage darkness descended the music sank to tones and quiet silvery moonlight the stage there alone in the sat restored to her right mind weeping over the head of her son and on this scene of sorrow the curtain fell slowly to the strains of sweet music the audience drew long and felt as though a nightmare were at an end let us go now said standing up and still clinging to s arm i wish i had not come she was interrupted by an from her mother mrs ward also was standing up but her eyes were fixed on miss bull the little old maid as though feeling the influence of that glance slowly looked in mrs ward s direction the eyes of the two women met from those of bull look of hate and she i a s the yellow tain of the box mrs ward was white and shaking clutching s arm she requested to be taken ta her carriage it is too much for me she said alluding to the stood on the pavement when the rolled away bearing the mother and daughter both silent both pale he was alone as and the war office clerk were back again in the hall said his eyes fixed on the retreating carriage so you know that little woman who called to see me about the lease i wonder how that comes about miss bull knew mrs and you mrs ward sent that yellow i wonder the old man stopped he could not quite understand what mrs ward was doing but he repeated his former observation a dangerous woman said he i shall speak to about lier and making up his mind to this he went in search of the all that night was haunted by strange dreams in which the figure of played a prominent part usually calm and self possessed slept like a child but the fierce music the mad dancing the knowledge that george knew this terrible woman  for so she appeared to the girl  caused her to sleep she was up early and after a breakfast that was a mere farce she took her way to the park it was her usual custom to walk in a lonely part about eight o clock in the morning but on this occasion she was at her usual spot by half past seven this was a seat under a spreading tree in the of a wide lawn few people came there at so early an hour and often read for an hour before returning home in a mechanical manner she took a book out of her pocket  it was the meditations of  and tried to fasten her attention on the of the a woman scorned emperor but it was impossible before her inner vision passed the wild flushed face of and could not drive it away while to do so some one came to sit on the seat rather surprised looked up she saw staring at her intently the looked pale and worn about her there was none of the influence of the previous night as the morning was cold she wore a coat and with a of red silk twisted round her throat this touch of color was all that was about her likely to suggest her foreign origin with her pale face and piteous mouth and appealing eyes she looked like a broken hearted woman s first movement was to go away but when she saw the sorrow on that wild face she remained where she was the two gazed at one another for a time and the thought in the mind of each was the	mark-twain
descended to the in order to examine kitchen and cellar more particularly if as stated the ribbon had been knotted loosely about the of the it must have fallen off unnoticed by the when weapon in hand he was retreating from the scene of crime he must have come down here from the sitting room mused as he stood in the cool damp kitchen and  as the ribbon was found by mrs near yonder door  it is most probable that he left the kitchen by that passage for the cellar now it remains for me to find out how he made his exit from the cellar and also i must look for the which he possibly dropped in his flight as he did the ribbon while thus lighted a candle which he had taken the precaution to bring with him for the purpose of making his having thus provided himself with means to the darkness he stepped into the door and descended the stone stairs which led to the at the foot of the steps he found himself in a passage running from the front to the back of the the silent house and forthwith turned to the right in order to reach the particular cellar which was dug out in the manner of a cave under the back yard this as ascertained by walking round was faced with stone and had on all four sides for the of wine overhead there was a glass of which the glass was so dusty and dirty that only a few rays of light could struggle into the depths below but what particularly attracted the attention of was a short wooden ladder lying on the stone pavement and which probably was used to reach the wine in the upper and i should not be surprised if it had been used for another purpose murmured glancing upward at the square of the it struck him as possible that a stranger could enter thereby and descend by the ladder to test the truth of this he reared the ladder in the middle of the cellar so that its top rung rested against the lower edge of the square overhead ascending carefully  for the ladder was by no means stout  he pushed the glass frame upward and found that it yielded easily to a moderate amount of strength climbing up step after step arose through the like a out of the earth and soon found that he could jump easily out of the cellar into the yard good i he exclaimed much gratified by this discovery i now see how the entered the silent house no wonder the kitchen door was bolted and barred and that no one was seen to visit by the front door any one who knew the position of that could obtain admission easily at any hour by descending the ladder and passing through cellar and kitchen to the upper part of the house so much is clear but i must next discover how those who entered got into this yard and indeed there seemed no outlet for the yard was enclosed on three sides by a fence of the height of a man and rendered to damp by a of tar on the fourth side by the house itself only over the fence  which was no obstacle  could a stranger have gained access to the yard and towards the fence opposite to the house walked in it there was no gate or opening of any kind so it would appear that to come into the yard a stranger would need to climb over a feat easily achieved by a active man as examined this frail barrier his eye was caught by a fluttering object on the left  that is the side in a line with the this he found was the scrap of a woman s veil of thin black spotted with velvet at once his thoughts to the shadow of the woman on the blind and the suspicions of great heavens i he thought can that doll of a be guilty after all chapter xii the veil and its owner as may be was considerably startled by the discovery of this important evidence so of s suspicions yet the knowledge which link had gained relative to mrs s remaining at to keep christmas seemed to contradict the fact and he could by no means reconcile her absence with the presence on the fence of the fragment of still less with the supposition that she must have climbed over a tolerably difficult obstacle to enter the yard let alone the necessity  by no means easy to a woman  of descending into the cellar by means of a and fragile ladder after all thought when he was seated that same evening at his dinner i am no more certain that the veil is the property of mrs than i am that she was the woman whose shadow i saw on the blind it was that gained entrance by passing over fence and through cellar must have come across the yard belonging to the house facing the other road therefore the person must be known to the owner of that house and loi the silent house i must discover who the owner is miss will know made this last remark with the greatest confidence as he was satisfied from a long acquaintance with his landlady that there was very little concerning her own neighbourhood of which she was ignorant the result his belief for when miss came in to clear the table  a duty she invariably undertook so as to have a chance of conversing with her admired  she was able to afford him the fullest information on the subject the position of the house in question the name of its owner the character of its tenants she was thoroughly well posted up in every item and willingly imparted her knowledge with	mark-twain

in the i last year of fitting for college this is perhaps  only human and it is easy to understand but it certainly is not education and of that fact both students and teachers are entirely well aware all this i say with no intention of anybody for what is the of difficult conditions it is not well however to what ia perfectly well known and what is one of the important difficulties of the situation talks on literature the problem then which the teacher in the secondary school is he has to decide in the first place what the teaching of literature can and should accomplish and in the second by what means this may most surely and be done in a word although work in this line has been going on and for years we are yet far from sufficiently definite ideas why and how literature should be taught to children n coin the of literature in tlie list of common school studies however the original intent may have been lost sight of vas undoubtedly made in the interest of it is not certain that those who put it in had definite of methods or results but unquestionably their idea was to aid the development of the children s minds by helping them to appreciate and to thoughts of nobility and of beauty and by a love for literature which should lead them to go on acquiring these from the how clear and well defined in the minds of this idea was it is needless to inquire it is enough that it was undoubtedly sincere and that it was founded on a genuine faith in the and influence of art the importance of literature as a means of i mental development used to be taken for granted our fathers and had for the a reverence which the rising generation looks bade to ae a phase of superstition hardly more reasonable than the worship of sacred wells or a belief in so much stress is now laid talks on teaching literature upon the and the material ab the only genuine that everything less obvious is the tendency is to take only direct results into consideration and influences which serve rather to character than to aid in are at best looked upon with that sense of mankind however which depends upon the perception of the few and which in the long run forms the opinion of society in spite of f everything holds still to the importance of in any intelligent scheme of education the popular makes difficult the work of the teacher but the force of the conviction of the wise keeps this branch in the the sincere teacher therefore naturally tries to effects and to discern possibilities in order to discover upon what the belief in the value of the study of literature properly rests the most obvious reasons for the study of may be quickly d of it is well for a c student to be reasonably familiar with the history of literature with the names and periods of great writers this adds to his chances of appearing to advantage in the world and especially in that portion of society where he can least afford to be at a disadvantage he is provided with about and authors as much to protect him  from the ill effects of appearing ignorant as for any direct influence this knowledge will have on his mind whatever the tendency of the times to the conditions is in daily life acquaintance with tbe more refined side of knowledge the fact remains that to betray ignorance in these lines may bring real harm to a person s social standing every one that among educated people a lad is better able to make his way if he does not confound the age of shakespeare with that of and if he is able to distinguish between and such information may not be specially vital but it ia worth possessing considerations of this sort however are evidently not of weight enough to account for the place of the study in the schools and still less to excuse the of time and attention bestowed upon it the same line of reasoning would defend the introduction of dancing because move who learned to dance more important and more far reaching reasons must be found to satisfy the teacher and to him for the severe labor of working with class after class in the effort not always successful of interest and enthusiasm over tbe writings which go by the name of english some of these i may briefly to deal with them would take a book in itself and would leave no room for the consideration of methods  a careful and intelligent study of of prose or verse the teacher soon must talks on teaching literature develop greatly the student s sense of the value of words is not the highest function of this work but it is by no means one to be literary affords opportunities for training of this sort which are not to be found elsewhere and a to word is with a child the beginning of wisdom children too often acquire and follow the habit of a words instead of ideas a gen  appreciation of the worth of language is after x all the chief outward sign of the distinction be the man the ne is content to receive speech as sterling coin and the other that words are but if students could but appreciate the difference between and what they are taught between learning words and ideas the intellectual would be at hand children need to that the sentence is after all only the envelope only the vehicle for the thought everybody to this but practically the fact is generally ignored the child is father to the man in nothing else more surely than in the trait of accepting in perfect good faith empty words as complete and satisfactory in themselves	charles-dickens

she drew her gown about her and fixed her expressive eyes on the police lord francis little dreamed of what had occurred as he fled from the hotel and yet it was he whom his wife was in her strange confession it was lord francis himself who had slain the count and in her presence it is known that great discoveries have been made during so called sleep men have made long journeys in their dreams and awakened by joseph ha unconscious of their travels others have arisen refreshed with a new sense of knowledge and power louis has confessed that he dreams his stories and then writes them out there was in a recent academy the picture of a young girl walking with closed eyes amid and the present writer has experienced in his own career an incident of sleep or trance during which he went forth in very truth with knife and pistol to commit as it seemed some great crime and was only prevented by the kindly guidance of a loving arm that held his own and led him back to the couch from which he had risen and thus it was when lord francis exclaimed too late o heaven to think my own eyes should be witness of my own eternal shame and  hers the hand of fate was stretched out against the and vicious count de for as lord francis staggered back to his room dazed stunned the cold tears up into his eyes his head on his arms his whole form limp with shattered nerves a new and terrible power was created within him he fell into a chair entirely overcome and for a little while appeared to sleep but it was the sleep that the sleep that walks and acts the dream sleep that takes possession of body and mind such sleep as that which afflicted lady after the murder of by the fate of hardly had de surprised the startled than lord francis arose from the chair and his steps toward his wife s room while all that he knew of himself was asleep nature in one of its strangest him forth back sir how dare you come here lady francis was exclaiming as he entered the room de had just risen from his knees and in s hand raised above her head was a gleaming dagger but my dear listen said the count back i say touch me and i will kill you oh this is foolish the frenchman answered another word and i will alarm the house that would only be to ruin your reputation said the daring lover god knows i have not much reputation to lose in the eyes of the world since it seems i have given you sufficient encouragement to bring you here well then why be cruel now you know i love you dearly as he made this last appeal stood her eyes no longer upon his but gazing as it seemed on hush she whispered her eyes fixed her figure rigid with fear she saw her husband steal into the room noted his face his lips blue his by joseph ha eyes piercing bright he seemed to toward her like an animal creeping upon its prey ah you said the count approaching her with loving action at which the apparition of the husband paused for a moment lady francis thought it was an apparition the unreal creation of her fears but as it came crouching on again as if ready to spring she realized the dreadful situation and in response to the count in his fool s paradise she whispered hush your hour has come and mine and o heaven he will never know i am innocent the next moment the stealthy figure rose up and seemed to the count as an might there was no noise no blow but a great iron grip held him by the throat and in a moment later the dagger was taken from the hand of lady francis and was thrust into the heart of the already dying man presently the deed was done and the murderer stood face to face with his wife he looked at her as if he saw her not she spoke he did not seem to hear her i am innocent frank she said but oh kill me too for you can never believe me i was seeking you when he came to me i had myself and determined to ask your forgiveness for my neglect of you but oh for nothing more as heaven is my judge but kill by the fa te of me you can never again think me a true and honest wife for a moment the stood and gazed at her but surely saw her not he is mad she said mad or have i lost my senses frank frank i will save you i am to blame i will accept the responsibility she did not move as she spoke nor did he they both looked steadily at each other she thought he was about to answer her when he moved away his steps from the room as stealthily as he had entered it she watched him with a strange fascination and without the power to move until he disappeared and then with a moaning cry she sank upon her knees and put out her hand toward the ghastly heap upon the floor in the hope that she was only dreaming and that all she had seen was mere but the carpet was wet and there was blood upon her hand why did i not kill him he had exclaimed as we know when he had returned to his own room and passed out of his sleep to life and consciousness he knew nothing of the scene in which he had played so terrible a part  knew nothing of the bleeding body lying in a

information on this and other local points of interest the glory of is the temple in honour of li a in the kingdom of the ancient the great engineer and his son whose work has the noble plain of from

above make the passage often to their own destruction on the right bank high on the cliff is a picturesque temple in a romantic situation with a beautiful roof of glazed green erected in honour of li or his son whose name has been so completely lost out of history that he is known only as the second gentleman and above this perilous the is about two hundred yards wide with more or less banks heavily wooded and at the point where the road crosses it on a very fine bridge about paces long the temple in china stands on a wooded height finely and adorned with stately lines of and other trees

surrounded with its living waters descend from the hill through the mouths of carved in stone noble flights of stone stairs lead to the grand entrance and from terrace to terrace thirty priests keep lamps and incense ever burning before the an imperial from visits the temple every year with gifts and of thousands of from every part of the plain and beyond bring their and homage to these the

heavy floating on the damp still air carved and figures on the roofs even the in front of the doors decorated with elaborate while the beauty of the interior is past description columns of highly polished black a roof a perfect marvel of carving and all available space occupied with the gift of past while the are literally with coloured and painting and the presented by the wave in front the

believed by mr the more recent above the of the every chinese emperor from the b c downwards has conferred the title of or prince upon li and his son a stone in one of the temples records the story which i learn from mr who has translated the inscription the plain which these honoured may be said to have created is the richest plain in china and possibly in the world it may be about miles by seventy or eighty with an area of about square miles it produces three and even four crops a year its chief are rice silk tobacco sugar sweet potatoes the paper and other and cotton along with roots and fruits of all kinds both and water being produced in quantities from any height the plain looks like a forest of fruit trees while of and the whereabouts of the great temples and fine with which it is studded it has an estimated population of and is sprinkled with cities and flourishing and large villages the capital having at least people along the main roads the population may be said to constitute a prolonged village the abundance of water power produces any number of flour and oil mills the plain is in all directions with roads which are thronged with traffic and boats can reach the

of what you earn and you keep the other quarter for yourself this was the strange proposal mr with which the man approached me i won t weary you with the account of how we and it ended in my moving into the house next lady day and starting in practice on very much the same conditions as he had suggested he came himself to live with me in the character of a resident patient his heart was weak by ths pat  nt it appears and he needed constant medical he turned the two best rooms on the first floor into a sitting room and bedroom for himself he was a man of singular habits company and very seldom out his life was irregular but in one respect he was regularity itself every evening at the same hour he walked into the con r room examined the books put down five and for every guinea that i had earned and carried the rest off to the strong box in his own h may say with confidence that he never had occasion to regret his speculation from the first it was a success a few good cases and the reputation which i had won in the hospital brought me rapidly to the front and during the last year or two i have made him a rich man so much mr for my past history and my relations with mr it only remains for me now to tell you what has occurred to bring me here to night some weeks ago mr came down to of ji by of me in as it seemed to me a state of considerable agitation he spoke of some which he said had been committed in the west end and he appeared i remember to be quite excited about it declaring that a day should not pass before we should add stronger to our windows and doors for a week he continued to be in a peculiar state of restlessness peering continually out of the windows and ceasing to take the short walk which had usually been the to his dinner from his manner it struck me that he was in mortal of something or somebody but when i questioned him upon the point he became so offensive that i was compelled to drop the subject gradually as time passed his fears appeared to die away and he had renewed his former habits when a fresh event reduced him to the pitiable state of in which he now lies what happened was this two days ago i received the letter which i now read to you neither address nor date is attached to it a russian nobleman who is now resident in by the resident patient england it runs would be glad to avail himself of the professional assistance of dr he has been for some years a victim to attacks on which as is well known dr is an authority he to call at about a quarter past six to morrow evening if dr will it convenient to be at this letter interested me deeply because the chief difficulty in the study of is the of the disease you may believe then that i was in my consulting room when at the appointed hour the page showed in the patient he was an elderly man and  by no means the conception one forms of a russian nobleman i was much more struck by the appearance of his companion this was a tall young man handsome with a dark fierce face and the limbs and chest of a he had his hand under the other s arm as they entered and helped him to a chair with a tenderness which one would hardly have expected from his appearance by of you will excuse my coming in doctor said he to me speaking english with a slight this is my father and his health is a matter of the most overwhelming importance to me i was touched by this filial anxiety yoa would perhaps care to remain during the consultation said l not for the world he cried with a gesture of horror it is more painful to me than i can ex press if i were to see my father in one of those dreadful i am convinced that i should never survive it my own nervous system is an q ally sensitive one with your permission i will remain in the waiting room while you go into my father s case to this of course i assented and the young man withdrew the patient and i then plunged into a discussion of his case of which i notes he was not remarkable for intelligence and his answers were frequently obscure which i attributed to his limited acquaintance with our language suddenly however as i sat by the resident patient he ceased to give any answer at all to my inquiries and on my turning towards him i was shocked to see that he was sitting bolt upright in his chair staring at me with a perfectly blank and rigid face he was again in the grip of his m malady my first feeling as i have just said was one of pity and horror my second i fear was rather one of professional satisfaction i made notes of my patient s pulse and temperature tested the of his muscles and examined his there was nothing in any of these conditions which with my former experiences i had obtained good results in such cases by the of of and the present seemed an admirable opportunity of its virtues the bottle was downstairs in my so leaving my patient seated in his chair i ran down to get it there was some little delay in finding it  five minutes let us say  and then i returned imagine my amazement to find the room empty and the patient gone of course my first act	edith-wharton

fact i have come to in his existence and to look upon the word as a mere term of reproach it may represent a temporary condition a passing mental phase a defiant reaction against an ideal but i cannot conceive that any man can continue to survey nature and to deny that there are laws at work which display intelligence and power the very existence of a world carries with it the proof of a world maker as the table the pre existence of the carpenter this one may form what conception one will of that maker but one cannot be an wisdom and power and means directed to an end run all through the scheme of nature the letters what proof do we want then from a book if the man who the stars and considers that they and their innumerable move in their serene dignity through the heavens each swinging clear of the other s  if i say the man who sees this cannot the creator s attributes without the help of the book of job then his view of things is beyond my understanding nor is it only in the large things that we see the ever present solicitude of some intelligent force nothing is too tiny for that care we see the minute of the insect carefully adjusted to fit into the of the flower the most hair and each with its definite function to perform what matter whether these came by special creation or by we know as a matter of fact that they came by but that only the law it does not explain it but if this power has cared for the bee so as to furnish it with its honey bag and its collecting and for the lowly seed so as to have a thousand devices by which it reaches a congenial soil then is it conceivable that we the letters the highest product of all are overlooked it is not conceivable the idea is inconsistent with the scheme of creation as we see it i say again that no faith is needed to attain the certainty of a most watchful providence and with this certainty surely we have all that is necessary for an religion come what may after death our duties lie clearly defined before us in this life and the standard of all so far that there is not likely to be any difference of opinion as to that the last the coming one will and when the world is ripe for it another will come and that the ever improving brain will give us an ever creed is it not glorious to think that is still living and acting  that if we have an as an we may have for our posterity well i really never intended to inflict all this upon you i thought i could have made my position clear in a page or so but you can see how one point has brought up another even now i am leaving so much i can see with the letters such certainty exactly what you will say if you a good providence from the good things in nature what do you make of the evil that s what you will say suffice it that i am inclined to deny the existence of evil not another word will i say upon the subject but if you come back to it yourself then be it on your own head you remember that when i wrote last i had just returned from visiting the at and that he had promised to let me know what steps he took in his as i expected i have not had one word from him since but in a way i did get some news as to what happened from this account which was second hand and may have been exaggerated did exactly what i had recommended and calling all his together he made them a long statement as to his position the good people were so touched by the picture that he drew of a worthy man fighting against that several of them wept and there was not only complete as to letting their bills stand over but even some talk of collection then and there to help the letters on his way he has i understand left but no one has any idea what has become of him it is generally supposed that he has gone to england he is a strange fellow but i wish him luck wherever he goes when i came back i settled down once more to the routine of my father s practice holding on there until something may turn up and for six months i have had to wait a weary six months they have been you see i cannot ask my father for money  or at least i cannot bring myself to take an unnecessary penny of his money  for i know how hard a fight it is with him to keep the roof over our heads and pay for the modest little horse and trap which are as necessary to his trade as a goose is to a tailor foul fare the grasping who a couple of guineas from us on the plea that it is a luxury we can just hold on and i would not have him a pound the poorer for me but you can understand that it is humiliating for a man of my age to have to go about without any money in my pocket it affects me in so many petty ways a poor man may do me a kindness and i have to seem mean in his eyes i may want a flower for a girl and must be the letters content to appear i don t know why i should be ashamed of this since it is no fault of mine and i hope that i don t show it to any	edith-wharton

steam or the lake has been known to sink feet and a month ago it its banks the prominent object was fire in motion but the surface of the double lake was continually over for a second or two with a cooled crust of a grey white like silver broken by jagged cracks of a bright rose colour the movement was nearly always from the sides to the centre but the movement of the centre itself appeared

the first half of terror had gone by the beauty of these made a profound impression upon me and the sight of them must always remain one of the most fascinating recollections of my life during three

the town when one can sit on the bench at the and look out over the huge blue bay and the yellow that curves before it i loved it round the red lamp when its great face was with the fishing boats and i loved it when the big ships went past far out a little of white and no with curved like a so stately and but most of all i loved it when no trace of man the majesty of nature and when the sun bursts down on it from between the drifting then i have seen the further edge draped in the of the driving rain with its thin grey under the slow clouds while my was golden and the sun gleamed upon the and struck deep through the green waves beyond showing up the purple patches where the beds of are lying such a morning as that with the wind in his hair and the spray on his lips and the cry of the in his ear may send a man back afresh to the of a sick room and the dead weariness of practice it was on such another day that i first saw my old man he came to my bench just as i was leaving it my eye must have picked him out even in a crowded street for he was a man of large frame and fine presence with something of distinction in the set of his lip and the of his head he up the winding path leaning heavily upon his stick as though those great shoulders had become too much at last for the failing limbs that bore them as he approached my eyes caught nature s danger signal that faint tinge in nose and lip which tells of a heart the is a little trying sir said i speaking as a physician i should say that you would do well to rest here before you go further he inclined his head in a stately old world fashion and seated himself upon the bench seeing that he had no wish to speak i was silent also but i could not help watching him out of the comers of my eyes for he was such a wonderful of the early half of the century with his low crowned curly hat his black satin tie which fastened with a at the back and above all his large clean shaven face shot with its of wrinkles those eyes ere they had grown dim had looked out from the box seat of mail and had seen the knots of as they toiled on the brown those lips had smiled over the first numbers of and had of the promising young man who wrote them the face itself was a seventy year and every an entry upon it where public as well as private sorrow left its trace that on the forehead stood for the perhaps that line of care for the winter it may be and that last little of wrinkles as my fancy hoped for the round the red lamp death of and so as i dreamed in my foolish way the old gentleman with the shining stock was gone and it was seventy years of a great nation s life that took shape before me on the in the morning bnt he soon brought me back to earth again as he recovered his breath he took a letter out of his pocket and putting on a pair of horn eye glasses he read it through very carefully without any design of playing the spy i could not help observing that it was in a woman s hand when he had finished it he read it again and then sat with the comers of his mouth drawn down and his eyes staring out over the bay the most forlorn looking old gentleman that ever i have seen all that is kindly within me was set stirring by that wistful face but i knew that he was in no humour for talk and so at last with my breakfast and my calling me i left him on the bench and started for home i never gave him another thought until the next morning when at the same hour he turned up upon the and shared the bench which i had been accustomed to look upon as my own he bowed again before sitting down but was no more inclined than formerly to enter into conversation there had been a change in him during the last twenty four hours and all for the worse the face seemed more heavy and more wrinkled that ominous tinge was more pronounced as he panted up the hill the clean lines of his cheek and chin were by a day s growth of grey and his large head had lost something of the brave carriage which had struck me when first i glanced at him he had a letter there the same or another but still in a woman s hand and over this he was and in his fashion with his brow and the comers of his mouth drawn down like those of a child so i left him with a vague wonder as to who he might be and why a single spring day should have wrought such a change upon him so interested was i that next morning i was on the look out for him sure enough at the same hour i saw him coming up the hill but very slowly with a bent back and a heavy head it was shocking to me to see the change in him as he approached i am afraid that our air does not agree with you sir i ventured to remark but it was as though he had no heart for talk he tried as i thought to make some fitting reply but it oflf into a and silence how bent and weak and old he ten	edith-wharton

stars  an effect which might have seemed and theatrical in another woman but which she carried off with great grace and dignity a little of diamond wheat ears rose above her head and swayed gently as she walked no one could entertain more than she for she moved about among the people with her amiable smile setting everybody at their ease by her kindly natural manner and by the conviction which she gave them that she was thoroughly at her ease herself how amiable she is i exclaimed who could help loving her there is only one family which can resist her said de glancing round to see that was out

walked about the room they whispered together and then madame turned to her mother behind her and the stem old lady tossed her haughty head in derision and contempt they feel that napoleon is theirs and that they ought to have everything they cannot bear to think that she is her imperial majesty and they are only her they all hate her joseph  all of them when they had to carry her train at the

beside her and she occasionally laid her hand with a caressing motion upon his arm that is her son de said my companion her son i i exclaimed for he seemed to me to be the older of the two de smiled at my surprise you know she married when she was very young  in fact she was hardly sixteen she has been sitting in her while her son uncle has been in egypt and so that they have pretty well over the gap between them do you see the tall handsome man who has just kissed s hand that is the actor he once helped napoleon at a critical moment of his career and the emperor has never forgotten the debt which the contracted that is really the secret of s power he lent napoleon a hundred thousand before he set out for egypt and now however much he him the emperor cannot forget that old kindness i have never known him to abandon a friend or to an enemy if you have once served him well you may do what you like afterward there is one of his c wh fa to night but he gained the cross at and so he is safe

with his nobler and his worse side so rapidly that i had no sooner made up my mind about him than some new revelation would destroy my views and drive me to some fresh conclusion that he was necessary to france was evident and that in serving him one was serving one s country but was it an honour or a penance to serve him was he worthy merely of obedience or might love and the reception of the esteem be added to it these were the questions which we found it difficult to answer  and some of us will never have answered them up to the end of time the company had now lost all appearance of formality and even the soldiers seemed to be at their ease many had gone into the side rooms where they had formed tables for and for et un for my own part i was quite entertained by watching the

my cousin your imperial majesty is her name you have only been in france a few days de said smiling but it seems to me that all the affairs of the empire are already revolving round you you must bring this pretty cousin of yours  the emperor said that she is pretty  to court with you and present her to me madame de r you will take a note of the name the had stooped again to the basket of wood which stood beside the fireplace suddenly i saw her stare hard at something and then with a little cry of surprise she stooped and lifted an object from the carpet it was the emperor s soft flat with the little sprang up and looked from the hat in her hand to the face of the minister how is this de she cried and the dark eyes began to shine with anger and suspicion you said to me that the emperor was out and here is his hat pardon me your imperial majesty i did not say that he was out what did you say then i said that he left the room a short time before uncle you are endeavouring to conceal something from me she cried with the quick instinct of a woman i assure you that i tell you all i know the s eyes darted from face to face she cried i insist upon your telling me this instant where

madame de r said she if these gentlemen will not tell us we shall very soon find out for ourselves she swept with great dignity towards the door followed at the distance of a few yards by her waiting lady whose face and unwilling steps showed that she perfectly appreciated the situation indeed the emperor s open and the public scenes to which they gave rise were so notorious that even in they had reached our ears napoleon s and his contempt of the world had the effect of making him careless as to what was thought or said of him while when she was carried away by jealousy lost all the dignity and restraint which usually marked her conduct so between them they gave some embarrassing moments to those who were about them turned away with his fingers over his lips while in an agony of apprehension continued to double up and to twist the cocked hat which he held between his hands only constant the faithful ventured to between his mistress and the fatal door if your majesty will resume your seat i shall inform the emperor that you are here said he with two hands outstretched ah then he is there she cried furiously i see it all i understand it all but i will expose him  i will

with eyes which gleamed with the just anger of an outraged wife she forced her way into her husband s presence but she was a woman of change and impulse full of little of courage and corresponding

of rather than of the works it is significant of the attitude the honest minds of children are likely to take by way of making things worse scholars are in a milton i the of  this essay the product of the author s hand is most lamentable the of is here and the one thing which students are sure to get from the essay is the conception that poetry is the product of to be and cast aside when civilization is sufficiently advanced again and ag in entrance and in second year i found this idea expressed it is not only the one thing which out of the essay hut is often the one conviction in regard to literature which has survived as the result of the study of tlie entire entrance in the entrance paper of the of for last year i had put a question in regard to the difference was this essay has from the but the of it ire still witli us as it waa used for all classes entering before ll f this because of its important on il point to up talks on teaching literature between poetry and from the replies i have taken a few of the many echoes from the study of the milton that the alone care for i agree with that prose is the product of civilization poetry was the way the themselves poetry is not being written nearly ao much now as in the dark ages simply because men are learning to treat subjects in says that the writer of a great poem must have a certain of mind and the statement that to he a great poet a man must first be aa a little child if these opinions are just one would think poetry could not he regarded as of a quality equal to prose works poetry came first in the lapse of time and as people grew more as their education grew higher they wrote in prose these hardly do justice to the views of but it is evidently absurd to try to interest pupils in poetry when they are getting from one of the works selected for careful study the idea that the poet is a semi madman one of tlie habits of a half race fortunately much of the reading is better although in effect the books are sometimes limited by the of keeping the interest of children see some difficulties up for the long poem tke in the list of and the lady of the lake of course on the part of the pupil familiarity in the lower with and brief narrative poems and in many cases this may be most pupils will be sure to care for the ancient many for the princess and any wholesome boy with ordinary intelligence should be interested in and as things stand however the teacher is x to deal largely with books which almost formal and treatment s speech on admirable as it is in its place and way will hardly give to a young student an insight into literature or a taste for imaginative work the normal average lad is likely it seems to me to be bored by or at least very mildly interested and i confess frankly my inability to understand how youthful enthusiasm is to be aroused or more than youthful secured for s life of or a life of johnson plenty of pupils are enough to allow themselves to be led placidly through these works and indeed to submit to any volume imposed by school but what the teacher is to do is to convince the i young readers that books entitled to the name literature are really of more worth and inter j eat than the newspaper the story the novel or the song it is perhaps not possible to find among the english talks on teaching literature works well adapted to such use  although i refuse to believe it  but i do at least feel that the present entrance list does not lend readily to say the least to the task of the teacher who aims at developing an intelligent and loving appreciation of literature the list of obstacles which beset the way of a teacher of literature might easily be lengthened but these seem chief they are but they exist they must be faced and overcome and nothing is gained by them the successful teacher the successful general is he who m clearly difficulties and best in means by which they may be iv obstacles tee set down in the last chapter exist in the conditions under which teachers must work they should be recognized to the end that they may be as far as possible overcome they can be done away with only by the slow and gradual changing of public opinion and the re forming of intelligence for the present they are to be reckoned with ae inevitable another class of obstacles to the ideal result of the teaching of literature exists largely in the application of the modem system or in the method of the individual teacher these may to a great extent be done away with by a proper understand s ing of conditions a just estimate of what may he accomplished and a wise choice of the means of i doing this teachers must take things as ey find j them but the ultimate result of work depends to a great extent upon how they take them if they must often accept unfortunate conditions they may at least reduce to a whatever is ive in their own method the most serious defects which depend lai ly upon individual teaching are four the first is the danger already alluded to of teaching children talks on teaching literature literature the ia that of making too great a demand upon the child the third is the common habit of to

when i came down here first i called in to get a cure for and he gave me one which acted like a charm who seemed to have a deep affection for her parent colored with pleasure as she rose to go father has his faults but he is a very clever man she said emphatically but for his failing he would be in street as a great men have more room for faults than small the lost men quoted don t look angry miss i really mean what i say your father is clever i m glad to hear that some one does him justice said the girl bitterly and looking more womanly as she spoke usually is against him but will help me to keep him straight when we are married mrs would drive him crazy she is my mother blushing i know that snapped miss it is the only thing i have against you as my husband but so long as she lives at a distance  well it s no use talking i m going now she went out to put on her hat and cloak while stood by the door he had just opened looking so downcast that clapped him on the back cheer up old boy it will be all right he said feeling profoundly sorry for the lad since mrs was decidedly a very disagreeable mother and then put a question when does your mother expect her she says she may get it at any time replied rather stiffly as he did not see why a stranger like the should interfere but i know very little about it all she told me was that she was to get two a year and would leave mr to go to oh i shall place no obstacle in her path observed somewhat grimly after all as i soon marry miss there will be no need for me to have a housekeeper it was at this moment and before could ask further questions which he very much wished to on the track do that returned evidently she had been crying for her eyes were red but her emotions were quite under control and after taking leave of her hostess and the two men she went away with seemed to be rather a forlorn young couple remarked as much when she returned to the drawing room after seeing them to the door what else can you expect asked coolly when they are connected with a like and a like mrs so she to go to does she i don t want to hurt your feelings miss but i see your father s finger in this say as little about my father as is possible answered with a rich color flushing her fair cheeks little as she respected her shady parent she did not intend to discuss him with a stranger whom she disliked was enough to away from the thin ice and i have taken all the papers and clothes and odds and ends of to the big house he remarked and there they can stay until we hear from the sea captain who the london lawyer has written him and the will we have not found it yet don t think we ever will find it commented i have searched the from cellar to without success i really believe that after all was dreaming and that the will doesn t exist either that said deliberately or mrs made away with and stole it can t believe that protested  t the lost pale i told you so before when you first the idea mr she is not a nice woman but i don t think she would commit a murder there is nothing mrs would not do if she were assured that her crime would remain insisted the grimly after all if mrs didn t kill who did and i and the housekeeper knew of the will and of its value as i was in town i am innocent and we know miss that is not the man to commit such a crime there only remains mrs who told your father when she made all things safe started and looked at the how do you mean smiled i believe that mrs murdered and now has the will she to sell it to your father for this grew red and her eyes grew bright how dare you say such a thing to me mr in the first place my father would never a crime even to gain a fortune in the second the moment mrs to sell him the will he would know her to be guilty of course replied soothingly and naturally would hand her over to the police it was only the idea of the which suggested the idea to me and maybe it is far fetched i miss bowed silently she did not like the tone in which the spoke as she felt convinced that he still held to his preposterous idea what is more in her own mind she did not consider that the idea was so preposterous as she declared on the track her father had been prepared to hush up the matter when he believed to be guilty so it was not improbable that he would make terms with mrs provided he secured the will still the girl did not intend to let know what she thought and therefore stood up for her absent parent i don t believe that mrs is guilty of such wicked conduct she repeated after a pause what grounds have you to say such a thing well murmured with a shrug no very good grounds i admit but mrs knew about the will before was murdered and i firmly believe that he was got rid of for the sake of the will this suggestion of an hints that she has the will and is trying to dispose of it at a price perhaps she has said nothing	mark-twain
success of his th success was not quite so rapid as the young hoped however his uncle was angry but he did not give way even after had had the to parade miss jane before the squire s very face on his arm at a he made no proposition to pay his nephew s debts and as his were becoming more and more pressing was forced to play his last card and actually ask miss jane to marry him miss jane was a shrewd little body and had not talked to her about his the bundle of time for nothing she understood the young fellow perhaps better than he did himself and it is certain that she would have made him a far better wife than he was in the ordinary course of things likely to pick up she was a little flattered that he should have chosen her as his and being a woman she enjoyed his while she yet knew perfectly well that they were worth nothing whatever you are not in earnest she said when he asked her to marry him not in earnest he repeated rather em at the turn things had taken do you think that i do not mean what i say i should be sorry to think that a descended to say anything that he did not mean miss jane responded with gentle severity blushed and wished himself a thousand miles away but when one has asked a woman to marry him he cannot gracefully retreat until she has at least given him some sort of an answer but you do not er me he said meekly oh i will answer you she said i would n t marry you for anything you could mention miss j ine not marry me echoed rather aghast at the of the fact that there was a woman in the village who would not jump at the chance to marry his royal self and i am not fond of being made a cat s either miss jane continued working her chin in her and young began to have a strong suspicion that when he undertook to trick his uncle by a sham of being engaged to an person he had made a mistake in his selection of the person he had never in his whole life had so awkward a moment and never had he felt so small he stammered something  he could not have told what it was and to it miss jane made no pretext of paying any attention whatever am i to understand that you really wish to make me your wife miss jane asked with an awful clearness of utterance which made the cold run down s if not why should i have asked you to marry me he returned with weak you do me the honor of supposing me to be a fool miss jane said l in the bundle of time i beg your pardon he said it j   you had better beg my pardon does it strike you as a manly thing mr to make a of a woman in this way many a girl might have taken you in earnest and not seen your game at all you might have destroyed the peace of her whole life how did you know that i was not as sentimental or as trusting as any one i was sure  began poor but she interrupted him fiercely she cried you were sure of nothing but that this was a way to deceive your uncle you did not do me the honor to give a single thought to what i might or might not feel you were so absorbed in yourself that you had not a thought to spare for me but i assure you broke in almost beside himself and feeling as if he were being in the public street by a woman that  you will assure me perhaps miss jane interrupted him again that you were honest with me and that you had no intention of deceiving the squire you are a nice fellow you must be proud of yourself after all that he has done for you and after miss jane the way in which you have repaid him to think of playing this trick on him you might have spared him if you had no on me miss jane s blood was up and for once in her life she indulged herself in the luxury of saying exactly what she thought and all she thought her victim in his chair like an unfortunate on a pin but there was no escape from the piercing glance of her eyes he had never in his whole life before been in a position where he was treated as a who could and must be judged by the same laws as those which governed the conduct of ordinary mortals he was accustomed to be regarded as one in whose favor there were always innumerable exceptions to be made and the sensation of being in with vulgar and was as disagreeable as it was novel really miss jane he remarked with a desperate attempt to rally his scattered dignity i must say that it seems to me that you are taking an extraordinary tone with me when one asks a lady to become his wife he at least expects that she will answer him kindly that depends miss jane responded nodding her head significantly well you l in the bundle of time shall be answered kindly i accept your offer we will be married in a month you had better tell your uncle to night he may not like the match an as there is n t any too much time for him to get reconciled to it in he had better know as soon as possible poor sat staring at her like one of reason if he had been disconcerted by her previous remarks this announcement completed his but	charles-dickens

most attractive area of prosperity for the first day the made more use of their shoulders than of their oars lifting and the boat which heavily over sand and and often like a cart over stones for the

knowing it  i fell to listening intently to that sound and even unconsciously counting the strokes of the mouse s presently i was exquisite suffering from this employment yet maybe i could have endured it if the mouse had attended steadily to his work but he did not do that he stopped every now and then and i suffered more while waiting and listening for him to begin again than i did while he was along at first i was mentally offering a reward of five  six  seven  ten  dollars for that mouse but towards the last i was offering rewards which were entirely beyond my means i close my ears  that is to say i bent the of them down and them into five or six folds and pressed them against the hearing  but it did no good the faculty was so sharpened by nervous excitement that it was become a and hear through the without trouble my anger grew to a frenzy i finally did what all persons before have done clear back to adam  resolved to throw something i reached down and got my walking shoes then sat up in bed and listened in order to exactly the noise but i couldn t do it it was as as a s noise and where one thinks that that is is always the very place where it isn t so i present men and things s ly hurled a shoe at random and with a vicious vigor it struck the wall over s head and fell down on him i had not imagined i could throw so far it woke and i was glad of it i found he was not angry then i was sorry he soon went to sleep again which pleased me but straightway the mouse began again which roused my temper once more i did hot want to wake a second time but the continued until i was compelled to throw the other shoe this time i broke a mirror  there were two in the room  i got the largest one of course woke again but did not complain and i was than ever i resolved that i would suffer all possible torture before i would disturb him a third time the mouse eventually retired and by and by i was sinking to sleep when a clock began to strike i counted till it was done and was about to again when another clock began i counted then the two great clock angels began to send forth soft rich melodious from their long trumpets i had never heard anything that was so lovely or weird or mysterious  but when they got to blowing the quarter hours they seemed to me to be the thing every time i dropped off for a moment a new noise woke me each time i woke i missed my and had to reach down to the floor and get it again at last all me i recognized s best funny stories the fact that i was hopelessly and permanently wide awake wide awake and feverish and thirsty when i had lain tossing there as long as i could it it occurred to me that it would be a good idea to dress and go out in the great square and take a refreshing wash in the fountain and smoke and reflect there the remnant of the night was gone i believed i could dress in the dark without waking i had banished my shoes after the mouse but my slippers would do for a summer night so i rose softly and gradually got on everything  down to one i couldn t seem to get on the track of that any way i could fix it but i had to have it so i went down on my hands and knees with one on and the other in my hand and began to gently around and the floor but with no success i enlarged my circle and went on and with every pressure of my knee how the floor and every time i chanced to against any article it seemed to give out thirty five or thirty six times more noise than it would have done in the in those cases i always stopped and held my breath till i was sure had not awakened  then i crept along again i moved on and on but i could not find the i could not seem to find anything but furniture i could not remember that there was much furniture in the room when i went to bed but the place was alive with it now  men and things chairs  chairs everywhere had a couple of families moved in in the mean time and i never seem to glance on one of those chairs but always struck it full and square with my head my temper rose by steady and sure degrees and as i on and on i fell to making vicious comments under my breath finally with a access of irritation i said i would leave without the so i rose up and made straight for the door  as i supposed  and suddenly confronted my dim image in the unbroken mirror it startled the breath out of me for an instant it also showed me that i was lost and had no sort of idea where i was when i realized this i was so angry that i had to sit down on the floor and take hold of something to keep from lifting the roof off with an explosion of opinion if there had been only one mirror it might possibly have helped to me but there were two and two were as bad as a thousand besides these were on opposite sides of the room i could see the dim of the windows but in my turned around condition they	helen-mathers

courteously giving his permission for mr to address his daughter and even adding that he had his best wishes for success this letter miss found in his room when he came home from one of the clubs about midnight and he read it with a grave face the night was rather warm and after the young man partially opened the shutters that covered the windows of his room a solitary figure was passing along the pavement on the opposite side of the way and something about it attracted his attention surely he had seen that form before that but rather uncouth body that gait which would be described as were it not so powerful strange exclaimed below his breath tt could be none other what was he doing in new why was s brother at midnight opposite that house a thousand miles from the city where he belonged

who goes through a disagreeable experience with the least possible display the had been affected to tears after the manner of women had given evidence of the greatest self command though she was evidently affected by the prospect of such an entire change in her existence but he did nothing but stare when she said farewell to him he on the opposite side of the room from which he did not move he responded as one might say good afternoon to a casual visitor that expressed his attitude according to mr the idea that might be with him did not seem they had nothing in common beside the girl was

how could that know enough to shadow anybody it was a wonder he had been able to get there with the requisite number of car changes a bright thought perhaps david would be able to offer a solution to the riddle went to sleep with this idea in mind he would tell about it but the next day when he saw the the greater matter made him forget the less miss giddy well it s done he said as the looked at him at least the has answered my letter and told me i have his blessing a pleasant smile arranged for the occasion mr s face a thousand congratulations he murmured and to day i suppose you will learn

a wise expression she loves you too well for that he said an expression of deep pain crossed the handsome features of the other i wish she didn t he muttered i never can come up to her expectations there will be the devil to pay sooner or later for the next hour the this notion he enlarged on the freedom of modern marriage especially in high life where the husband and wife are at liberty to live their own if you were a he said where you had to share three rooms with her you would constantly run the risk of and trouble in a house like that i am furnishing you need only meet when you are good

play the entire music of an opera interposed dr they give a short strain at the quarter hour and a longer one at the half hour that will be music all day long yes and all night long added the surgeon as he walked away with the captain i wish he were going to stay on board instead of that solemn old the greek and latin hum young america in holland a said who had a habit of speaking his mind very plainly do you know how the row was settled between him and the captain i do not but i am confident mr sustained the captain answered i was in hopes that we had got rid of him when he went on board of the ship yesterday and i was mad when i saw him coming back to day noon there is not a fellow in the that didn t have the same thought added don t see why a man need try to make himself as disagreeable as he does all the students were to treat him with respect and get their lessons well but he is as as an i wish we could get rid of him suggested of course we can t do that replied who was not disposed to get into any more we might make the uncomfortable for him suggested we m but i we had better not added the prudent made wise by experience as the bell for the cabin supper rang professor looked unusually gloomy and but he labored to keep up his dignity paul sat at the head of the table ordinarily witli his officers on each side of him in the order of their rank but oil the present occasion dr occupied the place at his right at the opposite end of the board was with the fat professor on his right behind the captain s chair stood the head steward while the second steward was stationed near the mr occasionally cast a glance at the young commander but paul seemed to be as composed as though nothing had happened to disturb the friendly relations between them though he did not ve it persisted that the learned gentleman looked ugly and would make another row as soon as he could get a chance i can see through the when there is a hole in it said the officer to when they went on deck again if there wasn t mischief in mr s eye there never was mischief in any man s eye what do you mean asked you know the old lunatic threatened to have the captain suspended for leaving the class he failed in that and if he don t try it again i m mistaken in the of course he won t make any more complaints till he has something to complain of and paul won t give him a chance i don t suppose he will voluntarily hut his conduct will be distorted i tell you the professor is ugly and he hates the captain as badly as a christian he hasn t improved his popularity on board by what he has done every fellow on the is down npon him there ll be a row on board soon in my opinion added ten ill as dr and paul came on i c h j holland and io a boat was lowered to send the surgeon on

the lecture on all hands attend on board ship shouted the of the as the signal to this effect on the young america ordinarily this call was not an agreeable one for the students had that it was music to listen to a stupid lecture on geography and history but in the present instance it was not so the information communicated in regard to england and scotland was so familiar to them that it was robbed of its interest but the school books contained only very meagre allusions to holland and many of them had read mr s eloquent descriptions of the bravery and devotion to principle of the dutch people in their civil wars and in their terrible conflict with the and they were desirous of knowing more about the country and its inhabitants holland is in itself an exceedingly interesting country the students had seen something of its and and were anxious to see more the region seemed to be very much like a ship for it was to keep the er out as much as possible and to pump out that which in or rained in the boys were to go on shore and they desired to c stand something of the history of the in order to appreciate the various objects which mighty events in the past the of was in sight at a bend up the river and they were curious to know its on both vessels the had been fo information by the more enthusiastic of the pupils and many interesting facts had been from the volumes but those who knew the most about the country were the most anxious to know more with only a few exceptions therefore the call to lecture on the present occasion was a welcome one the boats were lowered and all

centre in some places one came upon three varieties of or monkey cups some of their holding i should think a pint of and most of them packed with the of betrayed guests then in moist places upon steel blue and luxuriant and then came with white blossoms white all growing on or clinging to trees with scarlet and one to make incessant exclamations of wonder and delight you cannot imagine how crowded together this tropical vegetation is there is not room for half of it on the ground so it seeks and finds its home high up on the strong majestic trees which bear it up into the sunshine where indeed one has to look for most of the flowers it is glorious to see the vegetation of eternal summer and the lavish of nature and one plants at home and all the splendour of leaves and the beauty and grace of palms letter xx the sensitive plant and tree the great gaudy flowers are as marvellous as the gaudy birds and i feel that no words can convey an idea of the beauty and magnificence of an but the very of the beauty is almost a fault i should soon come to long for the burst of spring with its general tenderness of green and its great broad of flowers its masses of or ox eye or and for the of with ite red and gold and of purple these splendid and other grow singly one sees one and not another there are no broad masses of colour to blaze in the distance the are heavy and overpowering the wealth is embarrassing i in it all and rejoice in it au it is yet i am haunted with visions of banks with and of stream sides blue with of meadows golden with and fields scarlet with and in spite of my enjoyment and tropical enthusiasm i agree with mr and others that the flowers of a temperate climate would give one more lasting pleasure on either side of the road the ground is with the sensitive plant whose lovely leaves are green above and brown below it is a fascinating plant and at first one feels guilty of cruelty if one does more than look at it but i have already learned as all people do here to take delight in its touch any part of a leaf ever so lightly and as quick as thought it folds up touch the centre of the three ever so lightly and leaf and stalk fall smitten touch a branch and every leaf and every stalk falls as if with lead walk over it and you seem to have the earth with a fiery tread leaving desolation behind every trailing plant falls the leaves closing show only their red brown backs and all the the beauty has vanished but the burned and withered looking earth is as fair as ever the next morning after walking for four miles we came upon a glorious sight at a turn of the road a small lake behind which the mountains rise forest covered with a slope at feet on which stand the nut groves and the beautiful house of the of i have written of a lake but no water was visible for it was concealed by thousands and thousands of the leaves of the nearly round a of eighteen inches cool and looking under the sun with a blue bloom upon their intense green above them rose thousands of flowers and each one a thing of perfect beauty and not a withered blossom was to be seen the immense varied in colour from a deep rose crimson to a pink as pale as that of a blush rose some were just opening others were half open and others wide open showing the crowded golden and the golden in the centre from far off the deep rose pink of the glorious blossoms is to be seen

its relation to the study of language in general and in the third place it both in mind and allows the of the author with some sense of the effect he designed to give by the words he employed it is hardly necessary to say that in this matter of taking up the beforehand many teachers perhaps even most teachers will not agree with me the other side of the question is very well put in a by miss mary e published by the new england association of teachers in english my pupils i find can work longer and harder on and with constantly interest on any other suited to use just because these are so the pupils have the patience to with the of the text in general they feel only a languid interest in as delight the student of language for the expression he does n t know a hawk from a might foil to arouse their curiosity but when hamlet says i am but mad north north talks on teaching literature west when the wind is i know a hawk from a they are on the alert they really core to know what he and why he has used peculiar expression thus word might he mere is rendered interesting by the human element in the play  the element which in my opinion should always be kept well in the a lai number of teachers many of them very likely of experience greater than mine will agree with this view am not able to do so because i believe we should know the language before we try  to read but i at least hold that the first principle in any teaching ia that a teacher shall v follow the method which lie finds best adapted to hj own temperament for the who is convinced that the habit of taking up difficulties of language as they are met in actual reading to take them up then is perhaps the only effective way of doing things it seems to me however a little like sacrificing the literature to a desire to make teaching the easier it is very likely a way of interest in difficulties of language bat in teaching literature the of obscure words and phrases is of interest or value simply for the sake of the effect of the text and i hold that to this effect and to this effect as a whole everything else should be subordinate each teacher must decide for himself what is the proper method but i insist that no author  ever wrote sincerely without assuming that his was familiar to ms audience beforehand i preliminary work certainly i am not able to feel that it is wise to interrupt any first reading with anything save perhaps the possible explanations comments that are so short as not to break the flow of the as a whole the first reading of a narrative of any sort it may surely be said ia chiefly a matter of making the reader and especially the childish reader acquainted with the story since little real study can be accomplished while interest is concentrated on the plot it may be wise for the teacher to have a first reading without any more attention to the of than is absolutely needed to make the story intelligible and then to have the difficulties learned before a second and more intelligent going over of the work as a whole teacher must decide a point of this sort according to individual judgment and the character of the class el all the lower of school work whatever literature is given to the children should be in di tion and in so simple that very little of this sort of preliminary work need be done so long as what is selected has real literary excellence it can hardly be too simple we constantly forget it to me how simple is the world of children dr john brown dear and wise soul has justly children are long in or at least in looking at what is above tliey like the ground ami its flowers and stones its red and birds and l talks on teaching literature all its queer their world is about three feet high and they are more often stooping gazing np it does not follow tliat are to be fed od that sort of water which is so often aa literature they should be given the best the work of real writers but of this the simplest should be chosen and in dealing with it the children should not be with thoughts and ideas which are over their heads tbey live it must be remembered in a world about three feet high mentally as well as physically to remove and in reading beside having all obscure terms understood it is well to call attention to some of the most striking and beautiful passages in the book or poem which is to be read they should be taken up as detached and the pupils made to discover or to see how aud why each is good the pleasure of coming upon them when the text is read helps in itself it the strain on the mind of the student in the effort of comprehension and it the effect of the portions chosen my idea is that many ue passages may be treated almost as a part of the of the text their meaning and force may be made so evident and so attractive that when the complete play or poem is taken up a knowledge of these bits helps greatly in securing a strong effect of the work as a whole teachers too often it is to be feared work the it is to the young to understand and to feel at tlie same time we fail to recognize indeed how difficult it is for  or for any one  to feel while the attention is to take in the	charles-dickens

and the who wrote for them made them say it in this amazing fashion  it is not to be denied that any system which demands the of cars at a rapid rate at an elevation of fifteen or twenty feet is not entirely consistent in public estimation with the greatest from the dangers of such a use of words as this only the lack as well of mental vigor as of good taste and education on the part of the oh

as far as and money were concerned  oh save me from talking with that woman if you ask her to come and see you she never says she s sorry she can t come but that she regrets that the of her engagements her from accepting your polite invitation the foregoing instances are examples merely of a and ridiculous use of words which is now very common they are not remarkable for but the freedom with which by k richard grant white persons who have neither the knowledge of language which comes of culture nor that which springs from an perception and mastery are allowed to address the public and to speak for it produces a class of writers who fill as it is that they should fill our newspapers and public documents with words which are ridiculous not only from their but from their preposterous for the uses to which they are put these persons not only write in point of style but they do not say what they mean when for instance a member of is spoken of in a leading journal as a sturdy republican of integrity no very great acquaintance with language is necessary to the discovery that the writer is ignorant of the meaning either of progress or of integrity when in the same columns another man is described as being endowed with an nature people of common sense and education see that here is a man not only writing for the public but actually attempting to coin words who as far as his knowledge of language goes needs the instruction to be had in a good common school so again when another journal of position upon discipline tells us that a young woman is not fitted for the stem of religious life and we see it laid down in a report to an important public body that under certain circumstances the of an act is heightened and a very morality indeed it is according to our knowledge whether we find in the phrases stem and morality occasion for study or food for laughter writing like this is a fruit of a pitiful desire to seem elegant when one is not so which troubles many people and which itself in the use of words as well as in the wearing of clothes the buying of furniture and the giving of and which in language takes form in words which large and seem to the person who uses them to give him the air of a cultivated man because he does not know exactly what they mean such words sometimes become a fashion among such people who are numerous enough to set and keep up a fashion and they go on using them to each other each afraid to admit to the other that he does not know what the new word means and equally afraid to avoid its use as a british is said never to admit that he is entirely with a duke by by john t ho goes there gross   like the great in the forest in gross as nature is gross as or and so far as the and of the conventional man and

began to consider it time to bring his campaign to closer quarters it is well said by the poet id the spring the young man s fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love mr had gone to new york for a day or two on business mrs was confined to her home with a slight cold had the prospect of a clear field for the number of hours he was likely to need he called in the morning but only for a few minutes be had been invited to dinner for that day partly on their marriage bond s suggestion just before the husband went away come in and dine with if you can he had said don t neglect the house just because i happen to be out of it the lips and eyes of the young wife had cordially the invitation and had responded that he would try that he believed it would be convenient he reflected that a better opportunity could hardly come to him served the dinner mainly with her own hands she had but one servant but this only added to its charm he wanted to be alone with her as much as possible when they left the table he knew that they would in all probability be undisturbed and he sat down in the little parlor with a feeling that the curtain was about to rise on the first act of the long deferred drama he had no definite plan but kept himself ready for any move that circumstances might make you are dull to night what is the matter she said to him when he had waited for her to break the silence how can i help being dull he exclaimed with a trace of bitterness what is there to make me gay that is hardly a compliment to my company she responded trying to laugh off his mood perhaps it is he answered but let us not talk about that i may say things i shall be sorry for sometimes it is best to say what one has in mind she replied thoughtfully he roused himself do you tell me to say it will you permit me ht their marriage bond asked leaning toward her but no i cannot i dare not she extended a hand in his direction with the intention of him he took it in his own and pressed it gently respectfully reverently to his cheek then he arose took a few steps returned and sat by her side on the sofa she was occupying he said there is a punishment that falls with terrible force on the head of a man who has neglected his opportunities once i loved a girl with all my soul i love her yet i always shall love her i think sometimes that if i had had the courage at the right moment that girl might now be my wife i believed i had no right to speak the words that burned in my bosom and i waited until it was too late now i can only torment myself with the reflection of my folly and fear that after all she is not the happy wife my sacrifice was intended to make her do you wonder that i am dull it is a marvel that i have preserved my reason mrs colored highly as she listened she could not the allusion i believed it my duty she said firmly to obey the of my mother she did not possess his power to speak in what she had to say must be without and she insisted on joining you to a man you did not love he exclaimed because a few miserable acres of land lay side by side for you do not love him i have watched you and i know you do not love him as a wife should love a husband her thoughts were very deep at that moment it was her first direct opportunity to herself to a real friend their marriage bond no she said i do not love him there is no deceit between us he does not care for me either we talked it over before the wedding day he had his father to please he rose and walking to the rear of the sofa leaned over her poor girl he exclaimed with tears in his voice poor girl she allowed him to stroke her hair which he took pains to cease doing of his own accord tell me one thing he asked drawing a long breath it can do no harm now that the truth is being told would you have married me if i had dared to ask you i think i would have married any man my mother directed even though you were in love with another she nodded and a tear rolled down her cheek he felt a fierce longing to press his lips upon the tiny drop but he resisted it was not a time to risk all by one premature movement he took his silk handkerchief instead and touched it lightly to her eyes do you think a contract entered into in such a manner is binding even if it two lives he asked slowly and with a tremble in his voice there is no escape she replied with a gasp my mother is still living my husband gives no indication of a to release me it is idle to indulge in fancies he drew a chair close to her and threw all his power into what he said there is such a thing as divorce when two love each other should not force them apart their marriage bond she shook her head while her eyes fastened themselves on the carpet one cannot get a divorce unless given cause she whispered a man who does not love his wife will give cause sooner or later he responded with conviction she seemed frightened at the turn the conversation had taken for she	arthur-conan-doyle
of san and the rows of shops opposite impressed themselves upon his vision then the and last of all young mr gray a h h he said again he reached his hand toward a pocket of his and finding neither watch nor chain there he said love gone astray ah for the third time and began to get upon his feet what time is it he asked yawning and gray delighted that the conversation had thus begun responded that it was between seven and eight o clock the man spoke english and was apparently a native of the british eight o clock he replied why it was after ten when he paused and contracted his eyebrows confound it i believe i ve slept here all night this looked so probable that the person to whom it was addressed only answered witli a smiling nod he had sized up the rapidly during the last minute the movement toward the watch that had disappeared told its own story hard luck of some kind had caused the owner of the to part with it the clothes of the were of good cut and they had not suffered seriously from contact with a dry and reasonably clean pavement he brushed off the dust with care and then stretched himself again if you will excuse the liberty in a stranger said gray i was just going to get some coffee would you like to accompany me the englishman cast a quick look of suspicion at the speaker and then tried to conceal his action i suppose i am a curiosity to you said he and such i must at least for the present remain it would be folly to pretend that i selected this place for my nap on account of its comfort it in a was merely a matter of i did not have a in my pocket i could not my watch or chain or diamond pin or rings because i had none my very linen is held as security for rent i cannot pay with these statements i leave you to say whether you still wish my company or whether you would rather hand me a as yon would to any other and let me go all the generosity in gray s heart forbade the acceptance of the latter proposition the man had told him nothing but what he already suspected he replied quick y that his invitation still held good and that he trusted all disagreeable subjects would be banished from the slight refreshment of which they were to partake very well was the reply as they walked along toward s i will go with pleasure all the greater as it is twenty four hours since i tasted food to the exclamation which greeted this announcement the stranger added oh that is nothing if i were at liberty to tell you let me say only this i have been robbed my enemies have me and as you see they have left me in a rather disagreeable plight but my courage is still good and when my turn comes i shall pay them back with interest what may i call you asked handing his new acquaintance his card as they seated them selves at one of the tables i shall have to refuse you my true name for the present was the reply i am but for the purpose of conversation you may call me mr mr william love gone astray chapter ii the strange mr mr william the in the square by the with which he devoured the light meal that was soon before him he was finishing the second cup of coffee he had poured from the generous pot and on his third roll when an idea occurred to mr gray would you mind he said if i ordered some eggs for you along with my own i am not yet used to continental and find need of something rather more substantial between morning and noon mr laughed i should certainly like the eggs he answered and for the sake of them will pardon the of your invitation ask the waiter to make it three if you please eating once a day has its but it certainly to a healthy appetite the manner in which the stranger received his new friend s advances made it easy to get on comfortable terms with him and the that had crept into s manner rapidly disappeared you are an early it seems commented when there came a suitable point into which to throw the remark i was in a at four o clock replied gray with a blush partly of pride the strange mb indeed and what did you want at that hour only to see in her greatest quiet and then he went on somewhat to give the impressions he had formed before the sun rose and warming as he proceeded detailed the sights and sounds of that half journey it was clear that this was a to which mr could not respond he laughed a little from time to time and shook his head as if to say he saw no pleasure in that kind of a trip quite but with no attempt to sacrifice truth to politeness you are evidently a he said i suppose you read and and that sort of thing i them was the enthusiastic reply and do you write verses yourself asked no it almost seems as if i could though i feel all a poet s without confidence enough to express it i think there is no place so poetic as these watery streets anywhere on the globe mr responded that he had found the streets of very wet and the a slow and unsatisfactory vehicle even when he had money in his purse he said it took an time to get one of those silly when he had not a and his course led up and down over the flights of stairs called bridges	arthur-conan-doyle
sense of sight he would have enjoyed nothing better than merely to look at him for the rest of the afternoon having taken a very late r love at seventy breakfast he was not troubled by those which made glad to hear the noon signal sit down he added presently it is surely more comfortable here than out of doors as the lad feebly took a chair whispered to himself for the third time i think he is the most picturesque boy i ever saw the air of the counting room was undoubtedly to that of the street but the youth had something to think of beside his temporary comfort you are very kind said he but i cannot remain long i must find work to day somewhere looked at the slight figure there was much determination in its bearing an appearance entirely at with its slight bulk he had found very dull for the past month and this was the first thing that had in the least entertained him he wanted to retain the sensation what a a creature like this would be in that desolate region let me make a suggestion he said after a slight pause i am obliged to stay in this village and i am simply dying of in saying this i am making a confession to you with which i would not honor anyone else for the world you might suppose to look at me that i was the most contented chap on earth but the fact is i am just the opposite now i live at the hotel and have no one to talk to in the whole place unless it be some idiot like the book keeper with whom you have just had a bit of experience i want you to come up to the house with me and remain there picturesque and awhile as my guest i will not insult you by offering a salary for i want to treat you as one gentleman treats another what do you say a notion that this well dressed man was making fun of him came into the lad s head but he could see nothing to the idea in the straightforward glance that met his inquiring gaze i cannot accept your offer said he though i thank you for it it is absolutely necessary that i lose no time in getting employment was evidently disappointed and so you prefer work to taking your ease excuse me for saying that such a choice is quite incomprehensible i cannot see why anybody should want to work i have always thought it one of the ways of passing one s time even than sitting by this grate and watching the release themselves from that the lad stared at the speaker in great astonishment i have no friends no home no money he replied and his voice faltered what can i do but work the young gentleman could not take his eyes from the handsome fellow it was an outrage that such a picturesque specimen should be condemned to a life of what can you do he echoed why i have just told you have you never read that brilliant saying of s he says the only fitting occupation for a civilized man is to do nothing it at the lad shook his head in wonder he heard but he did not understand the idea that a person with empty pockets could live without labor was a new one to him if you really insist on working do not let me detain you added as his companion gave no sign of intending to reply it is easy to see though that you were never intended for a you are not built with a great rough frame feet and broad hands you are handsome excuse me and you have intelligence in your eyes it is ridiculous to think of you coal or iron or even grinding and yet that is what the of these works would probably have set you to do if there had been any place to offer you instead of replying in words the clad figure rose as if to take its leave you haven t told me your name said his brain to invent some means of keeping his new companion a little longer was the hesitating answer you look as if you had been ill remarked kindly i have then that is another reason why you should not think of doing anything like manual labor for the present don t be foolish come up to the hotel and dine with me after dinner we can talk it over this offer was declined with a motion of the head and another step was taken toward the doorway you are the strangest mortal i ever met picturesque and smiled advancing and placing one of his hands on the other s shoulder i will not oppose you any longer as it is evidently useless sit down again and wait until one o clock i will say the right word to the and he will employ you here there was a moment of hesitation and then the lad responded that he would rather go elsewhere there is no place here that book keeper told me so he said i could not take a place from which some one had to be discharged to make room for me looked much annoyed i say master you won t be able to keep that pace up he folks who persist in working for their living cannot be so particular that is one of the disagreeable things about the business you had better take this situation or a lunch or some money or something it is very cold weather as you may have noticed the next place you apply to will not be any more likely to have a than this one before you came this morning there were half a dozen in here asking the

with friendship and love with the bitter sweet of life and death william winter by t o william winter many are or and these are among the most mr winter in a preface to this latest volume expresses the hope that his verse may prove a not altogether unworthy addition to that old school of english poetry of which gentleness is the soul and simplicity the garment  and this describes not ill his accomplishment as well as his aim in poetry his prose falls into two main classes the and studies of stage and the essays in which his wanderings in the british islands are of the latter english gray days and gold old and ivy and shakespeare s england are representative winter writes these sketches mingling fact and sentiment in a way to make very pleasant and reading to the critical studies belong carefully wrought sketches of mary and henry and of many other players in these mr winter s views on the of the actor s art are set forth with much of literary attraction in his daily dramatic criticism he often in satire when attacking what he considers the latter day of the drama  the problem play the and the like and is never more vigorous and amusing though hardly fair to some of the literary forces but mr winter s preaching is both sane and wholesome and no doubt it is needed in a day of so much literary confusion altogether he may be described as a charming writer whose influence in his sphere has been decided and s van from life and art of joseph by co every reader of washington knows the story of van s adventure on the  that delightful romantic in which character humor and fancy are so delicately blended under the spell of s acting the spectator was transported into the past and made to see as with bodily eyes the orderly dutch civilization as it crept up the borders of the the quaint villages the stout with their pipes and the loves and troubles of an elder generation it is a calmer life than ours yet the same elements compose it here is a mean and cruel making a heedless man his victim and on the weakness that he well knows how to betray here is parental love by william winter as it often is by sad cares and here the love of young and hopeful hearts blooming amid flowers sunshine music and happiness van never seemed so as in the form of this great actor standing in poetic relief against the background of actual life has made him our familiar friend we see that is a fond of his bottle and his ease but  beneath all his rags and of character as well as  essentially good we understand why the children love him why the dogs run after him with joy and why the jolly boys at the tavern welcome his song and story and genial companionship he has wasted his fortune and his wife and child and we know that he is much to blame he knows it too and his talk with the children shows how keenly he feels the consequence of a weakness which yet he is unable to it is in those minute touches that his sympathetic study of human nature  his perception looking quite through the hearts and thoughts of men the observer saw this in the struggle of s long but only spirit of when his wife turns him from their home in night and storm and abandoned degradation still more vividly was it shown in his pathetic bewilderment  his touching of the anguish of lonely age bowed down by sorrow and doubt  when he comes back from his sleep of twenty years his disclosure of himself to his daughter marked the climax of pathos and every heart was melted by those imploring looks of mute suspense those broken accents of love that almost fears an utterance perhaps the perfection of s acting was seen in the weird interview with the ghosts that situation is one of the best ever devised for the stage and the actor devised it midnight on the highest peak of the dimly lighted by the moon no one speaks but the ghosts cluster around him the g m shade of a cup of drink to the mortal intruder already dazed by supernatural surroundings almost shuddering in the awful silence the ghosts in their liquor then suddenly the spell is broken the moon is lost in struggling clouds the glide away and slowly vanish and van with the drowsy piteous murmur don t leave me boys falls into his mystic sleep the idle drinking dutch  so perfectly yet so exalted by ideal treatment  is not a heroic by william winter figure and cannot be said to possess an significance either in himself or his experience yet his temperament has the fine fibre that everybody loves and everybody accordingly has a good feeling for him although nobody may have a good word for his way of life all know that order of man he is generally poor he never did a bad action in all his life he is continually cheering the weak and lowly he always wears a smile  the of a gentle heart ambition does not trouble him his wants are few he has no care except when now and then he feels that he may have wasted time and talent or when the sorrow of others falls darkly on his heart this however is rare for at most times he is bright as light and clear as wind nature has established with him a kind of kindred that she allows with only a chosen few in him shakespeare s rosy ideal is suggested  suppose the

and i confess my incredulity received at that moment a shock from which it never recovered i might the on the links son with myself as i pleased but i could not argue down the effect of what i had seen and i began to share in the italian terror it was already drawing towards the close of the day before i had returned the newspapers at the and got well forward on to the links on my way home i shall never forget that walk it grew very cold and boisterous the wind sang in the short grass about my feet thin rain showers came running on the and an immense mountain range of clouds began to arise out of the bosom of the sea it would be hard to imagine a more dismal evening and whether it was from these external influences or because my nerves were already affected by what i had heard and seen my thoughts were as gloomy as the weather the upper windows of the commanded a considerable spread of links in the direction of to avoid observation it was necessary to the beach until i had gained cover from the higher sand hills on the little when i might strike across through the hollows for the margin of the wood the sun was about setting the tide was low and all the uncovered and i was moving along lost in unpleasant thought when i was suddenly to perceive the prints of human feet they ran parallel to my own course but low down upon the beach instead of along the border of the turf and when i examined them i saw at once by the size and of the impression that it was a stranger to me and to those in on the links the who had recently passed that way not only so but from the of the course which he had followed near to the most formidable portions of the sand he was as evidently a stranger to the country and to the ill of beach step by step i followed the prints until a quarter of a mile further i beheld them die away into the south eastern boundary of there whoever he was the miserable man had perished one or two who had perhaps seen him disappear wheeled over his with their usual melancholy the sun had broken through the clouds by a last effort and colored the wide level of with a dusky purple i stood for some time gazing at the spot chilled and by my own reflections and with a strong and commanding consciousness of death i remember wondering how long the tragedy had taken and whether his screams had been audible at the and then making a strong resolution i was about to tear myself away when a gust than usual fell upon this quarter of the beach and i saw now whirling high in the air now lightly across the surface of the sands a soft black felt hat somewhat in shape such as i had remarked already on the heads of the i believe but i am not sure that i uttered a cry the wind was driving the hat and i ran round the border of the to be ready against its arrival the gust fell dropping the hat for a while the pa on the links upon the and then once more landed it a few yards from where i stood i seized it with the interest you may imagine it had seen some service indeed it was than either of those i had seen that day upon the street the was red stamped with the name of the maker which i have forgotten and that of the place of manufacture this it is not yet forgotten was the name given by the to the beautiful city of then and for long after a part of their the shock was complete i saw imaginary upon every side and for the first and i may say for the last time in my experience became overpowered by what is called panic terror i knew nothing that is to be afraid of and yet i admit that i was heartily afraid and it was with a sensible reluctance that i returned to my exposed and solitary camp in the sea wood there i ate some cold which had been left over from the night before for i was to make a fire and feeling strengthened and reassured dismissed all these fanciful terrors from my mind and lay down to sleep with composure how long i may have slept it is impossible for me to guess but i was awakened at last by a sudden blinding flash of light into my face it woke me like a blow in an instant i was upon my knees but the light had gone as suddenly as it came the darkness was intense and as it was blowing ttie on the links great guns from the sea and pouring with rain the noises of the storm effectually concealed all others it was i half a minute before i regained my self possession but for two circumstances i should have thought i had been awakened by some new and vivid form of nightmare first the of my tent which i had shut carefully when i retired was now and second i could still perceive with a that excluded any theory of the smell of hot metal and of burning oil the conclusion was obvious i had been awakened by some one flashing a bull s eye lantern in my face it had been but a flash

with a red frock and a bonnet and a full of things that brought my dear mother s eyes out like a s it was to see her so with money and she but a slip of a girl paying the man all that he asked and a whole over to which he had no claim she made no more of drinking beer than we did of water and she would have her sugar in her tea and butter with her bread just as if she had been english i took no great stock of girls at that time for it was hard for me to see what they had been made for there were none of us at s that thought very much of them but the smallest seemed to have the most sense for after they began to grow bigger they were not so sure about it we little ones were all of one mind that a creature that couldn t fight and was carrying tales the great shadow and couldn t so much as shy a stone without its arm like a rag in the wind was no use for anything and then the airs that they would put on as if they were mother and  a ther rolled into one for ever breaking into a game with your toes come through your boot or go home you dirty boy and clean yourself until the very sight of them was wearisome so when this one came to the at west inch i was not best pleased to see her i was twelve at the time it was in the holidays and she eleven a thin girl with black eyes and the ways she was for ever staring out in front of her with her lips parted as if she saw something wonderful but when i came behind her and looked the same way i could see nothing but the sheep s or the or father s breeches hanging on a clothes line and thai if she saw a lump of or or any common stuff of that sort she would over it as if it had struck her sick and cry how sweet how perfect i just as though it had been a painted l but i  ll to her play and but it was no for i could always catch her in three and she could never catch me though she would come with as much rustle and flutter as ten boys would make when i used to tell her that she was good for nothing and that her father was a fool to bring her up like that she would begin to cry and say that i was a rude boy and that she would go cousin of home that very night and never forgive me as long as she but in five minutes she had forgotten all about it what was strange was that she me a deal better than i did her and she would never leave me alone but she was always watching me and running after me and then saying oh here you are i as if it were a surprise but soon i found that there was good in her too she used sometimes to give me so that once i had four in my pocket all at the same time but the best part of her was the stories that she could tell she was sore frightened of so i would bring one to her and tell her that i would put it down her neck unless she told a story that always helped her to begin but when once she was started it was how she would carry on and the things that l d happened they were enough to take your breath away there was a ver that had been at and he was coming back in five years in a ship fuu of gold to make her his wife and then there was a i knight who had been there also and he had given her a ring which he said he would redeem when the time came she showed me the ring which was very like the ones upon my but she said that this one was virgin gold i asked her what the knight would do if he met the and she told me that he would sweep his head from his shoulders what they could all see in her was more than i could think and then she told me that she had been the great shadow on her way to west inch by a disguised prince i asked her how she knew it was a prince and she said by his disguise another day she said that her father was preparing a riddle and that when it was ready it would be put in the papers and any one who guessed it would have half his fortune and his daughter i said that i was good at and that she must send it to me when it was ready she said it would be in the and wanted to know what i would do with her when i won her i said that i would sell her by public for what she would fetch but she would tell me no more stories that evening for she was very about some things jim was away when cousin was with us but he came back the very week she went and i mind how surprised i was that he should ask any questions or take any interest in a mere he asked me if she were pretty and when i said that i hadn t noticed he laughed and called me a and said my eyes would be opened some day but very soon he came to be interested in something else and i never gave another thought until one day she just took my life in her hands and twisted it	edith-wharton

him his leg is broken broken exclaimed miss for such was her name suddenly up this is bad isn t it v said she appealing to he must be shot if she had added and you must shoot him she could scarcely have given him a greater turn he almost expected her to produce a pistol from her and perform the feat herself meanwhile she rode on to the spot and throwing her bridle over the sprang to tiie ground thank you said she as silently stood at the head of her horse and she then proceeded to examine and handle the invalid animal with great care and without any fear why i don t believe his leg is broken you stupid fellow said she his knee is i grant you and i don t believe he would have stumbled if you had not ridden him so badly poor fellow poor fellow poor patting him with great tenderness to s evident satisfaction and then a little to him on which to s surprise and pleasure exerted himself and struggled to his feet trembling all over oh you rogue were you v said miss caressing him no no

thinks nothing of distances she has ridden that horse of hers two thousand miles is it possible per she has or at any rate two hundred all the way from have you been long in her service three weeks and have been travelling all that time all that time have you got into any difficulties on the road per we have we were once nearly captured by the ay and how did you get off luckily the did not see us lucky certainly said disappointed of an adventure ah i was frightened i can tell you but the was not frightened she had a pistol and she told me that if we fell in with the and i ran away from her she would shoot me do you think she would have done so v per and what has the lady done v once she a man across the eyes did he cry out r per and resent it y s no a per laughed he thought though the lady had called herself she seemed very little to need protection hospitality is the virtue of o civilized races said by virtue of two letters i was able to travel two weeks and some days without ever except on one occasion seeing the inside of an inn consequently miss no sooner sent her letters to the and than they hastened to lay themselves their houses and all they possessed at her feet and when after a little hesitation presented himself at the he found these two gentlemen descending the stairs miss was seated at the window of the room which had been occupied by the miss it commanded a charming view of the bay and of the open sea beyond she was still in her habit and she sat herself with a large green fan her head uncovered and a face by no means shaded by a profusion of yellow brown hair i am glad of this opportunity of thanking you sir for your kindness on the road said she not only offering her hand but giving his a cordial grasp do you speak english y not a word luckily i am pretty in italian though i my accent is not good these polite of yours the and have been laying everything they possess at my command i can hardly understand such cordiality from perfect

of his art and the beauty of his execution to set his beautiful and achievement in a degraded and degrading light but fortunately the heart has its logic as well as the head and all are not without imagination the heart and imagination of our age know what means in and have accepted him therefore into the of the world does not love van because of his faults but in spite of them underneath his defects the human nature is sound and bright and it is out of this interior beauty that the charm of s arises the conduct of van is the result of his character not of his at the sacrifice of here and there the element of might be left out of his experience and he would still act in the same way and possess the same fascination the drink is only an expedient to involve the hero in domestic strife and open the way for his ghostly adventure and his pathetic the machinery is clumsy but that does not either the beauty of the character or the supernatural thrill and mortal anguish of the experience those elements make the soul of this great work which while it the heart also the imagination  lifting us above the storms of life its sorrows its losses and its fret till we rest at last on nature s bosom children once more and once more happy most persons who have seen as would probably name that achievement as essentially the most natural piece of acting ever presented within their observation in its effect it is natural in its method in the process by which it is wrought it is absolutely artificial in that method  not forgetting the soul within that method  will be found the secret of its power in the art with which genius and actual life and in that dwells the secret of all good acting if you would produce the effect of nature in dramatic art you must not be natural you must be artificial but you must seem to be natural the same step the same gesture the same tone of voice the same force of expression that you involuntarily use in the proceedings of actual every day life will not upon the stage prove adequate they may indicate your meaning but they will not convey it their result will be tame narrow and your step must be lengthened your tone must be elevated your muscles must be allowed a play the with which you intend to produce the by l o william winter effect of a sigh must leave your lips as a sob the actor who is exactly natural in his and speech upon the stage  who acts and speaks precisely as he would act and speak in a room  his audience because he falls short of his object and is indefinite and commonplace as has to present among other aspects of human nature a temperament that to some extent is swayed by an infirmity  the appetite for liquor that in actual life is offensive but that as shown by when it reaches his reaches them only as the token or suggestion of an amiable weakness and that weakness and not the symptom of it is the spring of the whole character and action the with which looks in at the window of the cottage where the offended is waiting for him is not the of a but the playful of an artist who is only suggesting a the effect is natural the process is artificial constantly addresses the imagination and he uses imagination with which to address it in actual life the garments worn by would be soiled in s artistic scheme the studied and carefully selected are clean and they are made not only harmonious in color  and thus so pleasing to the eye that they attract no especial attention  but with the sweet and indolent drifting spirit of the character no idea could easily be suggested more with probability more unnatural and fantastic than the idea of a vagabond encircled by a ring of dutch ghosts on the top of a mountain in the middle of the night but when  by the deep feeling and imagination with which he fills the scene and by the firm skill with which he his forces and guides them to effect  has made that idea a living fact no spectator of the weird thrilling pathetic picture ever thinks of it as unnatural the illusion is perfect and it is perfectly maintained all along its line the character of  the impossible hero of an impossible experience  is so essentially unnatural that if it were in the literal manner of nature it would produce the effect of whirling extravagance pouring his soul into an ideal of which he is himself the creator  an ideal which does not exist either in washington s story or charles s play or s of  and treating that idea in a poetic spirit as to every fibre tone hue motion by william winter and attitude has made as natural as if we had personally in his and wandering life so potent indeed is the poetic art of the actor that the dog who is never shown possesses all the same a positive existence in our thoughts the principal truth by s acting therefore is the necessity of clear perception of what is meant by nature the heights are reached only when inspiration is guided by intellectual purpose and used with artistic skill shakespeare with his felicity has this principle into diamond light   over that art which you say adds to nature is an art which nature makes all the following poems are from by william winter and published by co and

inclined to and would make the life of a woman a burden to her if he were permitted to do so i shall always be ready to give you advice an hour followed devoted to the general subject of husbands and of the best methods to be pursued under a large variety of circumstances the advice given by the elder lady while it would undoubtedly interest the reader is hardly for me to use as most of it was imparted under the seal of confidence it is probably daily in similar cases by other ladies who think they have discovered a sovereign for all the troubles incident to matrimony and the reader will have occasion to notice as this tale proceeds how valuable it proved to the young wife that was to be after considerable time had been consumed in reasons pro and con and agreed upon a date for their now that he had decided to marry and within a short time he could not endure the least unnecessary delay the girl found him as ardent as she could have wished two months were allowed for preparation each day of which exceedingly as the slight arrangements proceeded the young man seemed to change his entire disposition he grew as sentimental as any lover in poetic fiction his departure for his office in the morning was delayed beyond the y fa tt usual hour at noon he lingered longer than he had ever done and in the evening he never left the house unless she was with him the news of the impending event spread over the town and to all who knew him well enough to allude to the subject he responded proudly that it was a true report those who intended to turn the subject into a jest were taken by his manner the young business man rose in the estimation of his not only was he one of the brightest merchants of his age that they knew but he had the elements of a substantial man of family in his composition they said among themselves that he might have selected a wiser than that girl of the widow s but it might come out all right there was no for it always takes a good deal of sewing to prepare a young woman for the marriage altar there is a recognized list of things to wear that she ought to have in order to enter on the sacred obligations she is about to assume mrs could not do as much as she would have liked for her daughter in this respect but she ran the sewing machine day after day on such goods as she could afford until it seemed to the ignorant mr that a shop could easily have been set up out of the result of her labors some of the articles were exhibited to him with a sort of pride by miss the gowns the hats and that sort of thing some on the contrary were deemed too intricate too or too delicate for his inspection and when he entered the sewing room there were stifled screams and a sudden of labor while the forms of the two women were placed by a action between him and the in progress young s we shall have to establish a rule said mrs r one day that you are not to enter this room without knocking is it so bad as that he inquired with a smile s face always wore a smile during this period i would not mind myself said mrs but you can see how it might be to under some circumstances to have you enter there are many garments in progress of manufacture that are not supposed to be seen by gentlemen the smile on the young man s face deepened and yet i suppose the time will come when i shall see them all said he what was it that brought the tears to the mother s eyes she had done all she could to further this marriage she would not have undone it now had she been able why did she turn from him at his thoughtless words and pretend to busy herself over the work before her stopping to press her handkerchief to her face business went on just the same with his new of heart did not forget that produce was to be sold for others on commission and that he had nearly ten thousand dollars that would eat its head off as they say of horses unless invested he bought with caution and sold when he thought it wise and on the whole did well some new with whom he dealt suggested to him to come on and see them they knew that he was young and they had formed a very favorable idea of his ability one concern co threw out hints that he might be received into if terms could be arranged he wanted to see them but he could not leave just yet he could go there on his wedding tour pleasure with young s something that might prove more useful yes he

month it was a century the date could have been set earlier and it should have been but each day made one less after all and when but a week remained between him and his hour he found himself a little

which the object of his wrath was still seated what s this  a challenge laughed read for yourself replied mr as he sailed out of the mess room unwilling perhaps to trust himself any longer in the presence of his enemy read it and laughed again he handed it to who read it and laughed also savage said as he returned the note i suppose i must accept it or be as a coward added as he turned the dangerous paper over in his hands as persons often do when they have read a letter to ascertain if there is any more of it ejaculated in the present instance there was something more in the letter to reward the for his search  some by thb yankee ob thing which seemed to be of greater importance than the silly challenge it was intended to convey on th third page there was another note which mr had turned in without noticing it as it was part and parcel of the terrible document which had received he ventured to read it as follows  wednesday my dear i am sorry i was not able to see you last night as arranged the unexpected arrival of a business associate prevented me from keeping the appointment which you will please excuse my offer is still open and will remain so i don t know of any easier way by which you can make five thousand dollars and thus relieve your father s present necessities yours ever p five thousand dollars exclaimed when he had read the note that s a great deal of money and i hope it was not offered for doing any mean or wicked act did not understand this remark and it was too great an effort to ask an explanation therefore he said nothing was serious now for this note from was suggestive had been offered a large sum of money for doing some act had been offered double the sum to deliver him as a prisoner on board of the had by the adventures of a naval officer a decided hostility towards him since the first moment thej met there was no date to the note only the day of the week and the only thing that it proved was the  ct of a of some kind with he suspected that the offer related to himself  that at the most convenient time he was by some means to be given into the power of the he was not willing to believe anything worse than this of mr malicious as he had shown himself if s supposition was correct mr had been singularly unfortunate in the choice of the instrument of his evil purpose was little better than an idiot and by his display of towards his assumed victim he had almost destroyed his chance of carrying out his plan whatever it was decided to take no of the challenge at present but to keep both eyes wide open to defeat any evil intention his might cherish he did not see again till dinner time when that gentleman seemed to be cooler and more reasonable than when they had last met you received my note mr said he after dinner when they happened to be alone i did have you a note in reply no sir u by the yankee ob what have you to say in regard to the contents of my note nothing what do you propose to do about it nothing unless i hand it to the first lieutenant replied i might have expected that but i will do you the justice to say mr that i did not expect it if there is any person i despise in the mess it is a i have never believed you to be a gentleman of that description replied ti bs who was evidently much in dread of such a disaster what did you mean by the note mr demanded who could not lose sight of the ludicrous event which the contents of the suggested don t you understand it it looked very much like a proposition to fight a but as i don t believe you have courage enough to do anything of that kind i confess i am very much in doubt in regard to its real mr looked as dark and threatening as a thunder cloud another insult had been added to the list of his real or imaginary i meant to fight mr can you understand that said with emphasis where  here in the mess room by adventures of a naval officer the time and place are after considerations which can be adjusted when you accept challenge how would the fore yard do for the conflict laughed i will take the lee while you perch yourself on the weather yard arm that would be a novel idea in and it would afford half an hour s amusement for the whole ship s company what do you say you may treat this matter as lightly as you please i am in earnest and i will convince you that i have the courage to fight a if that is your object you may soon have an opportunity to show your pluck in a more sensible way  in close conflict with the enemies of your country this is sir in plain words sir will you or will you fight demanded working himself up into a frenzy beneath the sarcasm of his cooler companion in plain words mr i will not fight nor i will talk the matter over in a friendly way with you and if i have done anything wrong i will make it all

wedding they were married accordingly in the manner possible and went off to cambridge together where the professor and his charming wife were present at several and varied the routine of their by into and medical scientific friends were loud in their congratulations not only upon mrs grey s beauty but upon the unusual quickness and intelligence which she displayed in discussing questions the professor was himself astonished at the accuracy of her information you have a remarkable range of knowledge for a woman he remarked upon more than one occasion he was even prepared to admit that her might be of the normal weight one morning they returned to for the next day would re open the and professor grey himself upon having never once in his life failed to a s wife appear in his lecture room at the very stroke of the hour miss grey welcomed them with a constrained cordiality and handed over the keys of office to the new mistress mrs grey pressed her warmly to remain but she explained

that is what it must have been and there was another hard thing about it all a young girl in trouble needs the soothing solace and support and sympathy of persons of her own sex and the delicate offices and gentle which only these can furnish yet in all these months of gloomy in her never saw the face of a girl or a woman think how her heart would have leaped to see such a face consider if you would realize how great of arc was remember that it was out of such a place and such circumstances that she came week i after week and month after month and confronted the master of france single handed and baffled their schemes defeated their plans detected and avoided their traps and broke their lines their i and on the field after every engagement steadfast always true to her faith and of arc her torture the stake and answering threats of eternal death and the pains of hell with a simple let come what may here i take my stand and will abide yes if you would realize how great was the soul how profound the wisdom and how luminous the intellect of of arc you must study her there  where she fought out that long fight all alone  and not merely against the brains and deepest learning of france but against the the meanest and the hardest hearts to be found in any land pagan or christian she was great in battle  we all know that great in foresight great in loyalty and patriotism great in persuading discontented chiefs and conflicting interests and passions great in the to discover merit and genius wherever it lay hidden great in picturesque and eloquent speech great in the gift of firing the hearts of hopeless men with noble the gift of turning into heroes slaves and into that march to death with songs upon their lips but all these are they keep hand and heart and brain up to their work there is the joy of achievement the inspiration of stir and movement the applause which success the soul is overflowing with life and energy the faculties are at white heat weariness despondency  these do not exist yes of arc was great always great every of arc where but she was greatest in the trials there she rose above the and of our human nature and accomplished under and and hopeless conditions all that her splendid of moral and intellectual forces could have accomplished if they had been by the mighty helps of hope and cheer and light the presence of friendly faces and a fair and equal fight with the great world looking on and wondering  chapter xviii toward the end of the ten day interval the university of paris rendered its decision concerning the twelve articles by this finding was guilty upon au the counts she must her errors and make satisfaction or be abandoned to the arm for punishment the university s mind was probably already made up before the articles were laid before it yet it took it from the fifth to the to produce its verdict i think the delay may have been caused by temporary difficulties concerning two points i as to who the were who were represented in s voices j as to whether her saints spoke french only you understand the university decided emphatically that it was who spoke in those voices it would need to prove that and it did it found out who the were and named them in the verdict satan and this has always seemed a doubtful thing to me and not entitled to much credit i think so for this reason if the university had actually known it was those three it would for very s sake have told i  how it knew it and not stopped with the mere assertion since it had made explain how she knew they were not does not that seem reasonable to my mind the university s position was weak and i will tell you why it had claimed that s angels were devils in disguise and we all know that devils do disguise themselves as angels up to that point the university s position was strong but you see yourself that it eats it own argument when it turns around and that u can tell who such are while denying the like ability to a person with as good a head on her shoulders as the best one the university could produce the doctors of the university had to see creatures in order to know and if was deceived it is argument that they in their turn could also be deceived for their insight and judgment were surely not clearer than hers as to the other point which i have thought may have proved a and cost the university delay i will touch but a moment upon that and pass on the university decided that it was for to say that her saints spoke french and not english and were on the french side in political sympathies i think that the thing which troubled the doctors of was this they had decided that the three voices were satan and two other devils but they had also decided that these voices were not on the french side  thereby of arc asserting that they were on the english side and if on the english side then they must be angels and not devils the situation was embarrassing you see the university being the wisest and deepest and most body in the world it would like to be logical if it could for the sake of its reputation therefore it would study and study days and days trying to find some good common sense reason for proving the voices devils in article no i and proving them angels in article no lo however they had to give it up	helen-mathers

face she seemed stricken dumb her hands lifted to her forehead trembled visibly and mr sat there uncertain what to do as silent as herself gradually the force of the storm passed and miss staggered faintly to her feet mr offered to support her with his arms but she refused his aid with a motion that was unmistakable she was making every effort to conceal her agitation and she dared not trust herself with words after taking a weak step or two and finding that she could not walk she rested herself upon the arm of a large chair and signed to him to leave her much but knowing no other course

had informed her of the engagement and that she had made no reply when he was told a day or two later that had left the house he merely remarked that he was not much surprised as she was a girl of strong will and usually did about as she pleased mr at first much distressed over his daughter s action grew reconciled when he thought of it more at length he sent a liberal allowance to her which

return to the examination the first composition that was read was one entitled is this then life perhaps the reader can endure an extract from it in the common walks of life with what delightful emotions does the youthful mind look forward to some anticipated scene of imagination is busy rose tinted pictures of joy in fancy the of fashion sees herself amid the throng the observed of all her graceful form arrayed in snowy robes is whirling through the of the joyous dance her eye is brightest her step is in the gay assembly in such delicious fancies time quickly by and the welcome hour arrives for her entrance into the world of which she has had such bright dreams how fairy like does everything appear to her enchanted vision each new scene is more charming than the last but after a while she finds that beneath this goodly exterior all is vanity the flattery which once charmed her soul now harshly upon her ear the ball room has lost its charms and with wasted health and heart she turns away with the conviction that earthly pleasures cannot satisfy the of the soul and so forth and so on there was a of gratification from time to time during the reading accompanied by whispered of how sweet how eloquent so true etc and after the thing had with a peculiarly sermon the applause was enthusiastic then arose a slim melancholy girl whose face had the interesting that comes of and

mine eyes and heart and when dear they turn cold on thee there were very few there who knew what the meant but the poem was very satisfactory nevertheless next appeared a dark black eyed black haired young lady who paused an impressive moment assumed a tragic expression and began to read in a measured solemn tone a vision u dark and was night around the throne on high not a single star quivered but the deep of the heavy thunder constantly upon the ear whilst the terrific lightning in angry mood through the cloudy chambers of heaven seeming to scorn the power exerted over its terror by the

sudden reconciliation all trace of his recent anger seemed to have left him as he addressed his daughter but in spite of his altered tone i noticed that her eyes looked defiance and distrust i have some papers of importance to look over said he for an hour or so i shall be engaged i can guess that louis would like to see the old place once again and i am sure that he could not have a better guide than you if you will take him over iv she raised no objection and for my part i was at the proposal as it gave me an opportunity of learning more of this singular cousin of mine who had told me so much and yet seemed to know so much more what was the meaning of this obscure warning which she had given me against her father and why was she so frankly anxious to know about my love affairs these were the two questions which pressed for an answer so out we went together into the sweet coast land air the sweeter for the gale of the night before and we walked through the old lined paths and out uncle into the park and so round the castle looking up at the the grey the oak windows the ancient wing with its walls and its windows the modem with its pleasant and veil of and as she showed me each fresh little detail with a which made me understand how dear the place had become to her she would still keep offering her apologies for the fact that she should be the hostess and i the visitor it is not against you but against ourselves that i was bitter said she for are we not the who have taken a strange nest and driven out those who built it it makes me blush to think that my father should invite you to your own house perhaps we had been rooted here too long i answered perhaps it is for our own good that we are driven out to our own fortunes as i intend to do you say that you are going to the emperor  yes you know that he is in camp near here so i have heard but your family is still i have done him no harm i will go boldly to him and ask him to admit me into his service well said she there are some who call him a and wish him all evil but for my own part i have never heard of anything that he has said and done which was not great and noble but i had expected that you would be quite an english cousin man cousin louis and come over here with your pockets full of s guineas and your heart of treason i have met nothing but hospitality fix m the english i answered but my heart has always been french but your father fought against us at let each generation settle its own quarrels said l i am quite of your father s opinion about that do not judge my father by his words but by his deeds said she with a warning finger and above all cousin louis unless you wish to have my life upon your conscience never let him suspect that i have said a word to set you on your guard i gasped oh yes he would not stick at that i she cried he killed my mother i do not say that he her but i mean that his cold broke her gentle heart now perhaps you begin to understand why i can talk of him in this  as she spoke i could see the secret of years the bitter crushed down in her silent soul rising suddenly to flush her dark cheeks and to gleam in her splendid eyes i at that moment that in that tall slim figure there dwelt an spirit you must think that i speak very to you since i have only known you a few hours cousin louis said she uncle to whom should you speak freely if not to your own relative it is true and yet i never expected that i should be on such terms with you looked forward to your coming with dread and sorrow no doubt i showed something of my feelings when my father brought you in indeed you did i answered i feared that my presence was unwelcome to you most unwelcome both for your own sake and for mine said she for your sake because i suspected as i have told you that my father s intentions might be for mine why for yours i asked in surprise for she had stopped in embarrassment you have told me that your heart is another s i may tell you that my hand is also promised and that my love has gone with it may all happiness attend it said i but why should this make my coming unwelcome that thick english air has your wits cousin said she shaking her stately head at me but i can speak fi now that i know that this plan would be as hateful to you as to me you must know then that if my could have married us he would have united all claims to the succession of then come what might  or  nothing could shake his position i thought of the solicitude which he had shown over my toilet in the morning his anxiety that i cousin should make a impression his displeasure when she had been cold to and the smile upon his face when he had seen us hand in hand i believe you are right i cried right of course i am ri t look at him watching us now we were walking on the edge of the dried moat and as i looked up there sure enough was the little yellow	edith-wharton

that he could do certain things but the results he had expected as to the value of those things were not what he had hoped for at experiment any rate his experiment gave him greater sympathy with his boy than he had ever had before and they have become great the greatest disappointment of the whole affair is jack s who wonders why it is that he and his father have no more afternoon such as they had in the play room that day but until he is a good many years older his father cannot tell him for the boy could not in the present stage of his intellectual development understand him if he tried as for mr baker and the people at the office they were not at all astonished to hear the next day that was laid up and would probably not appear at the office again for a week although they were a little surprised when they learned that his trouble was and not softening of the brain s was in a blue mood the night before things hadn t gone quite to suit him during the year he had lost two of his most profitable  men upon whom for two years previously he had been able to count for a steady income it is true that he had lost them by winning their respective suits and had made two strong friends by so doing but as he once put it to mrs the worst position a man could possibly get himself into was that of one who is long on friends and short on income he did not the value of friends but he didn t want too many of them because beyond a certain number they became luxuries rather than necessities and his financial condition was such that he could not afford luxuries i love them all he said but i n s haven t money enough to entertain a quarter of them the last time was up here he smoked sixteen invincible cigars now i am very fond of but with cigars at twenty cents apiece i can t afford him more than one sunday in a year he s getting a little cold because i haven t asked him up since why don t you buy cheaper cigars at our store they have some very nice looking ones at two for five cents suggested mrs i don t wish to have to move out of the house said mrs failed to see the connection very likely you don t said but if i smoked one of your two and cent cigars in this house you d see the point in a minute if you will get me a yard of cotton cloth and let me put it in the furnace fire you ll get a fair idea of the kind of atmosphere we d be breathing if i allowed a cigar like that to be lit within fifty feet of the front door but you can get a good cigar for ten cents can t you mrs asked s yes  very good assented but would probably smoke of those and carry three or four away with him in his pockets lose even more that way it s a singular thing about friends they have some conscience about invincible cigars but they ll take others by the handful was also somewhat blue upon this occasion because none of his inventions  the little things he thought out in his leisure moments and out of some of which he had hoped to gain a deal of profit  had been successful the public had refused to place any confidence whatsoever in his patent which when turned inside out could be made useful as and the of new york actually rejected with scorn the which he had hoped would become a popular re because of its and an young man with care could make one of the order last through a whole season and it could be colored to suit the s taste with the ordinary paint boxes that children so delight in but in spite of this the was a distinct failure and had had his trouble for his pains to say nothing of the cost of the model but worst of all the failures because of the losses its failure was the safety lightning its failure was not due to any lack of merit for it certainly possessed much that was ingenious and the affair was not different in principle from a lawn six little sharp blades set on a would rapidly as the pretty machine was pushed up and down the cheek of the person and leave the face of that person as smooth as a piece of velvet but in announcing it to the world its had made the unfortunate statement that a child could use it with and some would be smart person on a comic paper took it up and wrote an clever article on the of a for children the consequence was that the safety was laughed out of existence and the additions to his residence which was going to pay for out of the proceeds had to be abandoned i don t like a blue he said s and generally i can find something to be thankful for at this season but fm if this year beyond the fact that we re all alive i can see any cause for my i haven t enough of it to last ten minutes much less a day what with the positive failure of my inventions the loss of income from what i once considered safe that have gone to the wall and the of my professional not to mention the fact that almost at the beginning of my professional year i am as tired physically and mentally as i ought to be at the finish oh well say you are thankful anyhow suggested mrs you will convince	catharine-maria-sedgwick
